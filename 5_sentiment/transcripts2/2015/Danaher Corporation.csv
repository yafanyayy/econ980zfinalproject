265621,280750893,749060,"Danaher Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow ge",2517,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. For the full year, our targeted organic investments helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet.
From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our 2 largest deals, Nobel Biocare and, which closed in December. We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these 2 highly complementary businesses for long-term success. 
Finally, we divested the electric vehicle system and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity.
In 2014, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represents the quality of thee earnings we generate. We also return more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion, while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%.
From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe grew at a mid-single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011, with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%.
Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points, with 3 of our 5 segments improving greater than 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D and sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013, while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points.
We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of $1 to $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013.
Now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points, while core operating margin declined slightly. Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate, with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform's highest quarterly growth rate in over 3 years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations such as Fluke Connect.
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, with our core Industrial and biomedical product lines each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy.
At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America, with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA 306 radiofrequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB-powered device which offers as much functionality as a benchtop equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radiofrequencies free of distortion and interference.
Our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprise businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions, where we continue to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the top line, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2x for the second half of 2014. And we believe our communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfactory -- satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our Communications business or NetScout.
At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25%, with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the Enterprise segment, with the launch of Pravail security analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global networks in real time and in greater detail than ever before.
Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and Enterprise Systems products. FNET's bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 5.5%, with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges.
Water Quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses.
Hach had another outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines, U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets.
Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the governments continued focus on Environmental protection.
And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the Water Quality testing process. Hach's new product introductions, including SL1000, have exceeded expectations with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013.
ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving $400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to market model.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits as sales of point-of-sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make it the preferred solution among customers looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR's vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits.
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics. Revenue increased 3%, with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year segment core operating margin has improved over 100 basis points.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits, with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. 
Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business, where new products such as Power Express drove record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continue, with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to meet mid-single digit growth. 
Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D total assay on its access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman's bone metabolism testing menu as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be vitamin D-deficient.
Beckman also introduced 4 immune suppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients.
Radiometer's core revenues were up approximately 10%, with sales increasing double digits and AQT growing over 35%. 2014 marketed Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary, with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5x to nearly $800 million, while tripling operating profit.
Leica Biosystem's core sales were up high single digits, with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of Bond systems in the quarter.
In December, Leica Biosystems acquired, a leading provider of minimally invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology through the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence.
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits, with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF with SWATH acquisition 2.0 software, with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year.
Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about 1 Homex, AB SCIEX's innovative partnership with Illumina. One Omex brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named 1 of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by the Analytical Scientists Magazine.
Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits, with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition, with the latest SP8 stead 3x receiving a top 10 innovation award from the Scientists Magazine. The stead further advances research in important fields, such as immunology, by providing scientists a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells.
Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 6%, while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We're excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team and the business ended 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers and we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel's performance with you in the coming months.
Dental consumables core revenues were up low single digits, with 30% growth in China and the Middle East partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business, continues to perform well, growing double digits. During the quarter, we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of elements free, a cordless handful featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontists unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures such as root canals.
Dental technology's core revenues were up low single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter, we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advance in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to date.
We also expanded our line of Dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo master search. The KaVo master surge line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for Dental implants and Oral surgery, improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The master surge line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues declined 1%, while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%.
Automation core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single-digit, with high single-digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe.
At Videojet, core revenue was up high single digits, as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched remote services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With remote services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these help Videojet increased their service contracts more than 20% in 2014.
X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced as the 2015 color of the year, with extensive media coverage online, in print and on TV. The color of the year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2014.
So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year, with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher Business System helped us to gain market share, while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macro economic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, leaves us confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes non-cash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better.
We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens Microbiology deal, which we expect to close in the near-term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%."

But we know the strength of the dollar is a headwind. We're doing things proactively as we did using the productivity initiatives to get a piece of that back. Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we'd also get a little bit of help, and that's part of the $0.05 that we've clawed back from what we think would be maybe a little bit of deflation that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport costs. So I think we got a few things that give us confidence in getting the first $0.05 back, but we're continuing to work on the balance for sure."

We are continuing to see very good performance in China. But, first of all, just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we've seen for a long time between high-growth markets and the developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S. Certainly, our execution in Europe, where we've gained share in a variety of places, continues to also support good performance on our side in the developed markets. On the high-growth markets side, again helping you're causing a narrowing of that delta, we've got a slower position in China in a macro sense. Obviously, some weakness in smaller markets where we have less exposure, but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia and Brazil clearly is in a slower growth mode than it had been in the prior couple of years. Probably a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses, but I see actually we believe a pretty good macroenvironment there at least at the moment. In China, specifically, Steve, we've had very good performance across a number of our businesses. The Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR performing exceptionally well there. Our Dental business continues to grow double digits in China, and probably the core weak spot remains are Life Science business. We talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding. But we think that there may be a point of stability that we've reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015. Dan was actually just there a week or so ago in China, and he may have a couple of thoughts."

Diagnostic was up double digit on a very large revenue base. And Industrial, which was negative, has returned to kind of modest growth as well.

265621,280750893,749190,"Danaher Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014.

We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. For the full year, our targeted organic investments helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet.
From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our 2 largest deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December. We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these 2 highly complementary businesses for long-term success. Finally, we divested the electric vehicle system and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity.
In 2014, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represents the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M instruments, water quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5% while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%.
From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high-teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe grew at a mid-single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011 with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%.
Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points with 3 of our 5 segments improving greater than 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D and sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013 while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of $1 to $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013.
Now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5% while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points while core operating margin declined slightly. Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform's highest quarterly growth rate in over 3 years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations, such as Fluke Connect.
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter with our core industrial and biomedical product lines each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy.
At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radiofrequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB-powered device, which offers as much functionality as a benchtop equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radiofrequencies are free of distortion and interference.
Our Communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprise businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions, where we continue to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the top line, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2x for the second half of 2014. And we believe our Communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfactory -- satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our Communications business or NetScout.
At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25% with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail security analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global networks in real time and in greater detail than ever before. Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET's bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses.
Hach had another outstanding quarter with growth across most major product lines, U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets. Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government's continued focus on environmental protection. And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality testing process. Hach's new product introductions, including the SL1000, have exceeded expectations with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013.
ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving $400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to-market model.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits as sales of point-of-sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make it the preferred solution among customers looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR's vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits.
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics. Revenue increased 3% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year segment core operating margin has improved over 100 basis points.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business, where new products such as Power Express drove record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continued with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to mid-single-digit growth. 
Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D Total assay on its Access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman's bone metabolism testing menu as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be vitamin D-deficient. Beckman also introduced 4 immune suppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients.
Radiometer's core revenues were up approximately 10% with HemoCue sales increasing double digits and AQT growing over 35%. 2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5x to nearly $800 million while tripling operating profit.
Leica Biosystem's core sales were up high single digits with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of BOND systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of minimally invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence.
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF with SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year. Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about OneOmics, AB SCIEX's innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named 1 of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by The Analytical Scientist magazine.
Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a Top 10 Innovation award from the Scientists Magazine. The STED further advances research in important fields, such as immunology, by providing scientists a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells.
Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 6% while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We're excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team. And the business ended 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers. And we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel's performance with you in the coming months.
Dental consumables core revenues were up low single digits with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business, continues to perform well, growing double digits. During the quarter, we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of elementsfree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontists unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures, such as root canals.
Dental technology's core revenues were up low single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter, we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advance in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants and oral surgery, improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues declined 1% while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%. Automation core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits with high single-digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high single digits as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched Remote Services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With Remote Services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these helped Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20% in 2014.
X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year with extensive media coverage online, in print and on TV. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2014.
So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher Business System helped us to gain market share while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, leave us confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes noncash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens microbiology deal, which we expect to close in the near term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%."

We're continuing to see very good performance in China. But first of all, just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we have seen for a long time between the high-growth markets and the developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S. Certainly, our execution in Europe, where we've gained share in a variety of places, continues to also support good performance on our side in the developed markets. On the high-growth market side, again helping or causing a narrowing of that delta, we've got a slower position in China. In a macro sense, obviously some weakness in smaller markets, where we have less exposure, but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia. And Brazil clearly is in a slower growth mode than it had been in the prior couple of years. Probably a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses, but I see -- actually, we believe a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China, specifically, Steve, we've had very good performance across a number of our businesses. The Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR are performing exceptionally well there. Our Dental business continues to grow double digits in China. And probably the core weak spot remains the Life Science business. We talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding. But we think that there may be a point of stability that we've reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015.

And interestingly, we're outperforming in Europe. We think we're taking share in Europe. We saw broad-based performance across the businesses in Europe, so no particular concern there. I think teams are clearly looking very selectively market-by-market. These currency shifts have not been exclusively in Europe. They've been in quite a number of markets. Generally, we're pretty well positioned in terms of the functional currency that we transact in. But where there are issues, our teams are carefully looking at those situations. And we'll take price very selectively where we need to or compete on price if it comes to that."

We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014.

We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. For the full year, our targeted organic investments helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet.
From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our 2 largest deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December. We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these 2 highly complementary businesses for long-term success. Finally, we divested the electric vehicle system and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity.
In 2014, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represents the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M instruments, water quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5% while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%.
From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high-teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe grew at a mid-single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011 with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%.
Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points with 3 of our 5 segments improving greater than 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D and sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013 while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of $1 to $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013.
Now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5% while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points while core operating margin declined slightly. Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform's highest quarterly growth rate in over 3 years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations, such as Fluke Connect.
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter with our core industrial and biomedical product lines each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy.
At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radiofrequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB-powered device, which offers as much functionality as a bench top equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radio frequencies are free of distortion and interference.
Our Communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprise businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions, where we continue to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the top line, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2x for the second half of 2014. And we believe our Communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfactory -- satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our Communications business or NetScout.
At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25% with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail security analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global networks in real time and in greater detail than ever before. Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET's bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses.
Hach had another outstanding quarter with growth across most major product lines.  U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets. Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government's continued focus on environmental protection. And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality testing process. Hach's new product introductions, including the SL1000, have exceeded expectations with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013.
ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving $400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to-market model.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits as sales of point-of-sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make it the preferred solution among customers looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR's vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits.
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics. Revenue increased 3% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year segment core operating margin has improved over 100 basis points.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business, where new products such as Power Express drove record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continued with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to mid-single-digit growth. 
Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D Total assay on its Access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman's bone metabolism testing menu as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be vitamin D-deficient. Beckman also introduced 4 immune suppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients.
Radiometer's core revenues were up approximately 10% with HemoCue sales increasing double digits and AQT growing over 35%. 2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5x to nearly $800 million while tripling operating profit.
Leica Biosystem's core sales were up high single digits with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of BOND systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of minimally invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence.
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF with SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year. Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about OneOmics, AB SCIEX's innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named 1 of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by The Analytical Scientist magazine.
Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a Top 10 Innovation award from The Scientist Magazine. The STED further advances research in important fields, such as immunology, by providing scientists a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells.
Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 6% while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We're excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team. And the business ended 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers. And we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel's performance with you in the coming months.
Dental consumables core revenues were up low single digits with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business, continues to perform well, growing double digits. During the quarter, we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of elementsfree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontists unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures, such as root canals.
Dental technology's core revenues were up low single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter, we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advance in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants and oral surgery, improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues declined 1% while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%. Automation core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits with high single-digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high single digits as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched Remote Services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With Remote Services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these helped Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20% in 2014.
X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year with extensive media coverage online, in print and on TV. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2014.
So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher Business System helped us to gain market share while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, leave us confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes noncash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens microbiology deal, which we expect to close in the near term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%."

Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we'd also get a little bit of help, and that's part of the $0.05 that we've clawed back from what we think would be maybe a little bit of deflation that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport costs.

But first of all, just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we have seen for a long time between the high-growth markets and the developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S. Certainly, our execution in Europe, where we've gained share in a variety of places, continues to also support good performance on our side in the developed markets. On the high-growth market side, again helping or causing a narrowing of that delta, we've got a slower position in China. In a macro sense, obviously some weakness in smaller markets, where we have less exposure, but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia. And Brazil clearly is in a slower growth mode than it had been in the prior couple of years. Probably a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses, but I see -- actually, we believe a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China, specifically, Steve, we've had very good performance across a number of our businesses. The Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR are performing exceptionally well there. Our Dental business continues to grow double digits in China. And probably the core weak spot remains the Life Science business.

265621,280750893,749589,"Danaher Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow ge",2516,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation. For the full year, our targeted organic investments helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet.
From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our 2 largest deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December. We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these 2 highly complementary businesses for long-term success. Finally, we divested the electric vehicle system and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity.
In 2014, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represents the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M instruments, water quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5% while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%.
From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high-teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe grew at a mid-single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011 with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%.
Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points with 3 of our 5 segments improving greater than 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D and sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013 while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of $1 to $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013.
Now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5% while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points while core operating margin declined slightly. Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform's highest quarterly growth rate in over 3 years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations, such as Fluke Connect.
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter with our core industrial and biomedical product lines each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy.
At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radiofrequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB-powered device, which offers as much functionality as a bench top equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radio frequencies are free of distortion and interference.
Our Communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprise businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions, where we continue to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the top line, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2x for the second half of 2014. And we believe our Communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfactory -- satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our Communications business or NetScout.
At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25% with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail security analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global networks in real time and in greater detail than ever before. Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET's bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses.
Hach had another outstanding quarter with growth across most major product lines. U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets. Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government's continued focus on environmental protection. And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality testing process. Hach's new product introductions, including the SL1000, have exceeded expectations with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013.
ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving $400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to-market model.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits as sales of point-of-sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make it the preferred solution among customers looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR's vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits.
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics. Revenue increased 3% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year segment core operating margin has improved over 100 basis points.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business, where new products such as Power Express drove record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continued with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to mid-single-digit growth. 
Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D Total assay on its Access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman's bone metabolism testing menu as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be vitamin D-deficient. Beckman also introduced 4 immune suppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients.
Radiometer's core revenues were up approximately 10% with HemoCue sales increasing double digits and AQT growing over 35%. 2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5x to nearly $800 million while tripling operating profit.
Leica Biosystem's core sales were up high single digits with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of BOND systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of minimally invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence.
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF with SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year. Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about OneOmics, AB SCIEX's innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named 1 of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by The Analytical Scientist magazine.
Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a Top 10 Innovation award from The Scientist Magazine. The STED further advances research in important fields, such as immunology, by providing scientists a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells.
Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 6% while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We're excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team. And the business ended 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers. And we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel's performance with you in the coming months.
Dental consumables core revenues were up low single digits with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business, continues to perform well, growing double digits. During the quarter, we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of elementsfree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontists unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures, such as root canals.
Dental technology's core revenues were up low single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter, we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advance in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants and oral surgery, improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues declined 1% while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%. Automation core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits with high single-digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high single digits as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched Remote Services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With Remote Services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these helped Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20% in 2014.
X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year with extensive media coverage online, in print and on TV. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2014.
So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher Business System helped us to gain market share while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, leave us confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes noncash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens microbiology deal, which we expect to close in the near term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%."

But we know the strength of the dollar is a headwind. We're doing things proactively as we did using the productivity initiatives to get a piece of that back. Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we'd also get a little bit of help, and that's part of the $0.05 that we've clawed back from what we think would be maybe a little bit of deflation that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport costs. So I think we've got a few things that give us confidence in getting the first $0.05 back, but we're continuing to work on the balance for sure."

We're continuing to see very good performance in China. But first of all, just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we have seen for a long time between the high-growth markets and the developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S. Certainly, our execution in Europe, where we've gained share in a variety of places, continues to also support good performance on our side in the developed markets. On the high-growth market side, again helping or causing a narrowing of that delta, we've got a slower position in China. In a macro sense, obviously some weakness in smaller markets, where we have less exposure, but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia. And Brazil clearly is in a slower growth mode than it had been in the prior couple of years. Probably a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses, but I see -- actually, we believe a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China, specifically, Steve, we've had very good performance across a number of our businesses. The Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR are performing exceptionally well there. Our Dental business continues to grow double digits in China. And probably the core weak spot remains the Life Science business. We talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding. But we think that there may be a point of stability that we've reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015. Dan was actually just there a week or so ago in China, and he may have a couple of thoughts."

Diagnostic was up double digit on a very large revenue base. And Industrial, which was negative, has returned to kind of modest growth as well. Life Science was down mid-single digit for the full year, kind of in that zone in the fourth quarter.

We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a changing and challenging macroenvironment using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue growth and expand core margins in the quarter. DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify, direct and execute on high impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, 7 of our 9 strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter, including Test & Measurement instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation.
We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions, including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin that further boosted our performance.
This is another record first quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.93, including a negative $0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January. Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion, with core revenues up 5%, due in part to extra selling days in the quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011. Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues, while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%.
Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digits. The performance was mixed as strength in China and India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. In China, sales increased nearly 10%, led by our Dental, Diagnostics and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms. The developed markets also grew at a mid-single-digit rate, with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digits. In Japan, as expected, sales declined double digits due to a difficult prior-year comparison in which customers accelerated purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014.
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4%, marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core operating margin expanded 25 basis points or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency, with 3 of our 5 segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%.
On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on 3 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, including the acquisition of the Siemens microbiology business. These acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our Dental, Diagnostics and Product ID platforms.
In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share, and we expect further increases over time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel, combined with recent volatility in the global equity markets, uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues declined 1.5%, with core revenues up 2.5%. Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points, and core operating margin declined 225 basis points largely due to lower sales in our higher gross margin Communications platform.
Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, led by the developed markets and China. 
Fluke core revenues were up high single digits as its biomedical and thermography product lines each increased double digits. Strength in thermography was augmented by the launch of the TI x560 and TI x520 series of thermal imaging cameras during the quarter. This expert series combines an articulating lens, on-camera analytics and the industry's largest responsive LCD touch screen, allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under and around objects to quickly capture process and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot.
At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in China. During the quarter, Tektronix introduced the new high performance ATI oscilloscope, the DPO 70,000FX. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented single capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Core revenues from our Communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security solutions and high single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions. Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we'll achieve positive core growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, and this morning we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
Moving to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 7%, with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin expanded 175 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%.
Our Water Quality platforms core revenues grew approximately 10%, with robust growth in our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses.
Hach had an outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew double-digit as the team's application of DBS growth tools, such as thermal management and transformative marketing, continue to drive share gains. We built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough Water Quality testing system, the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer or PPA in over 40 countries. Notably, the PPA's ease-of-use has already started to change the way our customers perform critical water quality test, making it one of the most important new products in the market.
At ChemTreat, we saw a robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investments in Feet on the Street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job implementing this approach in Latin America, with its most recent acquisition, Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in the quarter.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in China and the U.S. In the U.S., upcoming ENV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We are pleased that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment system upgrades.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues grew 2%, with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by onetime noncash charges related to the recently closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens microbiology business, which is now known as Beckman Coulter Microscan.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core sales were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines. In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates helped drive mid-single-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rates is an example of the team's persistent focus on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past 3-plus years. Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, lean and leadership tools can make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Brea, California, our investor and analyst event in June to hear more of this terrific story.
In January, Beckman closed the previously announced acquisition of Microscan. Microscan expands our well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate, automated instruments and consumables that help identify infection-causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments.
Radiometer's core sales increased high single digits, its 13th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. Demand was solid across all product lines, led by double-digit growth in blood gas ad AQT. During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of assay or PCT. PCT detects life-threatening sepsis infections on site, in operating rooms and other critical care centers, enabling doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives.
Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high single digits, led by advanced staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter. We posted double-digit growth in the U.S., with stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved capital spending.
We were also encouraged by a strong start of Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December, where reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools helped to drive approximately 10% growth in the quarter.
Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digits, with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe. Notably, we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter.
SCIEX core sales grew double digits, led by strength in clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in meaningful share gains over the past several quarters.
Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits due in part to difficult comparison in Japan, where we saw record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we're confident in Leica's steady stream of new product innovation, including the DMI 8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The DMI 8 improves customer workflow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more quickly than what traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design providing one solution for both basic and advanced industrial users.
Turning to Dental, our Dental revenue increased 30%, with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin product lines and combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development, resulted in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline. Robust demand in high-growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking. That said, we're encouraged by the improving sellout data we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of the year.
Nobel Biocare completed its first full quarter with Danaher, and we've made good progress so far. While still early, we were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single-digit average daily sales growth for the quarter.
One of Danaher's core values, innovation defines our future, certainly rang true at the biannual international dental show in March, where KaVo Kerr group and Nobel Biocare launched more than 35 new or updated products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care, from digital imaging to treatment units to consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated share site CAT scan solution, which will allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices.
In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5%, with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded 185 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. 
Automation core revenues increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our industrial automation, North American distribution and medical end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance since early 2011.
Product Identification core revenues increased high single digits, with robust demand for our marking and coding, color management and software solutions. 
Videojet had a solid start to the year, delivering high single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies, with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and 1650 high-resolution micro-printers that enable fast, high-quality printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care where legibility and clarity are critical to consumer safety and industry regulations.
In March, Esko acquired Media Beacon, a leader in digital asset management software. Media Beacon saves our customers time and money by allowing them to store, repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across projects, departments and channels. Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools.
So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015, delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The team's solid execution using the Danaher Business System continued to drive relative outperformance and enhance our competitive position. We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macroenvironment. However, we are confident that our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger Danaher in 2015 and the years to come. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015."

And it's hard not to think that the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar strengthen against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example. We continue to perform exceptionally well there. We have, during the entire shift of the currency, we've seen solid mid-single-digit growth in that market. We know that market generally across a number of our businesses is probably more of a low single-digit market on a core growth basis, and so we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there. You can look at Japan as another example where those shifts have happened and certainly there's been some modest shifts in the competitive dynamics there. But again, our business is generally, in spite of a very challenging environment there overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're continuing to perform well. So we start there and think about competitiveness. Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we're going to see currencies move down. It takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. And the day you think you've got that right is the day a currency might turn against you and you end up in a very different place than you had hoped. So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that has provided a certain level of natural hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and therefore the impacts have bled through the P&L. So we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint, putting manufacturing operations in the best cost position that we can with the best logistics and supply chains, but these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning."

I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very closely with those distribution partners and we're very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So we are confident in our competitive positions. We understand that we are performing well, that those distribution partnerships are working very effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting toward the end of that. Q2 is probably more of a transition quarter, and we are optimistic that we'll see better growth going forward. But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now one last point there, because we're confident in our competitive position, because in a number of areas, particularly outside the U.S., the Dental platform is performing extremely well, driving anywhere from mid-single-digit in certain markets, like China growing double digits, we continue to invest in that business, investing in new products, you heard me talk about the 35 new products across the platform, investing in sales and marketing. So while we got some headwind there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay off as time goes on."

And I think on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places where we knew we were doing well, we knew that things got choppy, continue to invest and stay the course would ultimately prove out to our benefit on a long-term basis. I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that staying that course would be in Europe, again where we've seen this lower growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint. It's true today also in our high-growth markets where we've seen a few of our market sites, specifically Latin America, specifically Brazil and Mexico, where we've gotten challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint but also making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investments carefully where there's higher growth opportunities and there are some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job shifting that investment. Staying the course in China right now as well, staying the course in India from an investment standpoint, both of those countries is paying off very well for us across a number of the platforms. So staying the course, making some discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard to make sure we take advantage of what's a choppy environment."

And those are also businesses where we do have good gross margins and we always look those gross margins and the improvement of those gross margins as indicative of higher value propositions that we're delivering to our customers. Those are sometimes value propositions associated with new product innovations, sometimes they're associated with improvements in our technical service and support, our ability to get price across a number of our markets. So this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter after quarter and year after year. So that's the way we tend to think about it. And I would extend that by the way to the way we think about capital allocation, is looking at businesses and opportunities in the market that represent those same characteristics, good growth opportunities across global markets, high brand preference to professional end-users representing solid gross margins and the ability to build sustainable business models, strong consumable streams that really speak to a level of resilience and ultimately competitive advantage.

On the other side, we've seen some geographic markets improved, India being one, again team's performing quite well there. So I think that's one way to look at it. Europe is steady, but again we think we're outperforming in that market. So I think those are a few of the things that we would point to. On the short cycle Industrial side, really, Dan Daniel's teams, a number of those businesses, automation we talked to a little while ago, really are performing very well. And that's really just a function again of I think a combination of new product innovation in the number of places as well as good day to day go-to market execution."

And I think you see a couple of examples there recently, right. You look at Siemens Micro, how that strengthened our position at Beckman.

We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a changing and challenging macroenvironment using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue growth and expand core margins in the quarter. DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify, direct and execute on high-impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, 7 of our 9 strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter, including Test & Measurement instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation.
We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions, including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin that further boosted our performance.
This is another record first quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.93, including a negative $0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January. Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion, with core revenues up 5%, due in part to extra selling days in the quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011. Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues, while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%.
Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digits. The performance was mixed, as strength in China and India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. In China, sales increased nearly 10%, led by our Dental, Diagnostics and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms. The developed markets also grew at a mid-single-digit rate, with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digits. In Japan, as expected, sales declined double digits due to a difficult prior year comparison in which customers accelerated purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014.
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4%, marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core operating margin expanded 25 basis points or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency, with 3 of our 5 segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%.
On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on 3 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, including the acquisition of the Siemens microbiology business. These acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our Dental, Diagnostics and Product ID platforms.
In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share, and we expect further increases over time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel, combined with recent volatility in the global equity markets, uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues declined 1.5%, with core revenues up 2.5%. Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points and core operating margin declined 225 basis points, largely due to lower sales in our higher gross margin Communications platform.
Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, led by the developed markets and China. 
Fluke core revenues were up high single digits, as its biomedical and thermography product lines each increased double digits. Strength in thermography was augmented by the launch of the TiX560 and TiX520 series of thermal imaging cameras during the quarter. This expert series combines an articulating lens, on-camera analytics and the industry's largest responsive LCD touch screen, allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under and around objects to quickly capture process and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot.
At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in China. During the quarter, Tektronix introduced new high -- the new high performance ATI Oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented single-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion, so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Core revenues from our Communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security solutions and high single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions. 
Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we'll achieve positive core growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015. And this morning, we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
Moving to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 7%, with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin expanded 175 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%.
Our Water Quality platforms core revenues grew approximately 10%, with robust growth in our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses.
Hach had an outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew double digit, as the team's application of DBS growth tools, such as thermal management and transformative marketing, continue to drive share gains. We built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough Water Quality testing system, the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer or PPA in over 40 countries. Notably, the PPA's ease-of-use has already started to change the way our customers perform critical water quality test, making it one of the most important new products in the market.
At ChemTreat, we saw a robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investments in feet on the street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job implementing this approach in Latin America, with its most recent acquisition, Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in the quarter.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in China and the U.S. In the U.S., upcoming EMV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We're pleased that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment system upgrades.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues grew 2%, with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by onetime noncash charges related to the recently closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens microbiology business, which is now known as Beckman Coulter-Microscan.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core sales were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines. 
In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates helped drive mid-single-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rates is an example of the team's persistent focus on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past 3-plus years. Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, lean and leadership tools can make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Brea, California in our Investor and Analyst event in June to hear more of this terrific story.
In January, Beckman closed the previously announced acquisition of Microscan. Microscan expands our well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate, automated instruments and consumables that help identify infection-causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments.
Radiometer's core sales increased high single digits, its 13th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. Demand was solid across all product lines, led by double-digit growth in blood gas and AQT. During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of Procalcitonin -- the Procalcitonin assay or PCT. PCT detect life-threatening sepsis infections on site, in operating rooms and other critical care centers enabling doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives.
Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high single digits, led by advanced staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter. We posted double-digit growth in the U.S., with stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved capital spending.
We were also encouraged by a strong start of Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December, where reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools helped to drive approximately 10% growth in the quarter.
Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digits, with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe. Notably, we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter.
SCIEX core sales grew double digits, led by strength in clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in meaningful share gains over the past several quarters.
Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits due in part to a difficult comparison in Japan, where we saw record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we're confident in Leica's steady stream of new product innovation, including the DMi8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The DMi8 improves customer workflow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more quickly than with traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design providing one solution for both basic and advanced industrial users.
Turning to Dental. Our Dental revenue increased 30%, with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin product lines. And combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development, resulted in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline. Robust demand in high-growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking. That said, we're encouraged by the improving sellout data we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of the year.
Nobel Biocare completed its first full quarter with Danaher, and we've made good progress so far. While still early, we were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single-digit average daily sales growth for the quarter.
One of Danaher's core values, innovation defines our future, certainly rang true at the biannual International Dental Show in March, where KaVo Kerr Group and Nobel Biocare launched more than 35 new or updated products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care from digital imaging to treatment units to consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated share site CAT scan solution, which will allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices.
In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5%, with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded 185 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. 
Automation core revenues increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our industrial automation, North American distribution and medical end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance since early 2011.
Product Identification core revenues increased high single digits, with robust demand for our marking and coding, color management and software solutions. 
Videojet had a solid start to the year, delivering high single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies, with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and 1650 High Resolution Micro Printers that enable fast, high-quality printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care, where legibility and clarity are critical to consumer safety and industry regulations
In March, Esko acquired MediaBeacon, a leader in digital asset management software. MediaBeacon saves our customers time and money by allowing them to store, repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across projects, departments and channels. Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools.
So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015, delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The team's solid execution using the Danaher Business System continued to drive relative outperformance and enhance our competitive position. We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macroenvironment. However, we're confident that our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger Danaher in 2015 and the years to come. 
We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015."

And it's hard not to think that the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar strengthen against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example, we continue to perform exceptionally well there. We have -- during the entire shift of the currency, we've seen solid mid-single-digit growth in that market. We know that market, generally across a number of our businesses, is probably more of a low single-digit market on a core growth basis, and so we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there. We can look at Japan as another example where those shifts have happened and certainly there's been some modest shifts in the competitive dynamics there. But again, our business is generally -- in spite of a very challenging environment there overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're continuing to perform well. So we start there and think about competitiveness. Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we're going to see currencies move down. It takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. And the day you think you've got that right is the day a currency might turn against you, and you end up in a very different place than you had hoped. So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that has provided a certain level of natural hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and, therefore, the impacts of -- are bred through the P&L. So we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint, putting manufacturing operations in the best cost positions that we can with the best logistics and supply chains. But these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning."

But generally, it starts with that volume position. And then the destocking, yes, in fact, was the primary driver relative to the higher-margin products being the areas where -- we, very cooperatively and teaming with our distribution channels, made very conscious decisions about what we needed to do in the channel from an inventory perspective. I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very closely with those distribution partners, and we're very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So we're confident in our competitive positions. We understand that we're performing well, that those distribution partnerships are working very effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting towards the end of that. Q2 is probably more of a transition quarter, and we're optimistic that we'll see better growth going forward. But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now one last point there, because we're confident in our competitive position, because in a number of areas, particularly outside the U.S., the Dental platform is performing extremely well, driving anywhere from mid-single digit to -- in certain markets like China, growing double digits. We continue to invest in that business, investing in new products. You heard me talk about the 35 new products across the platform, investing in sales and marketing. So while we got some headwind there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay off as time goes on."

And I think on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places where we knew we were doing well. We knew that as things got choppy, continue to invest and stay the course would ultimately prove out to our benefit on a long-term basis. I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that, staying that course would be in Europe, again, where we've seen this lower growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses, and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint. It's true today also in our high-growth markets where we've seen a few of our markets -- sites, specifically Latin America, specifically Brazil and Mexico, where we've got some challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint. But also making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investments carefully where there's higher growth opportunities, and there are some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job, shifting that investment. Staying the course in China right now as well, staying the course in India from an investment standpoint, both of those countries is paying off very well for us across a number of the platforms. So staying the course, making some discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard to make sure we take advantage of what's a choppy environment."

So this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter after quarter and year after year. So that's the way we tend to think about it.

That obviously bodes well for continued performance because as we build that installed base, crossing number of the businesses, those annuity streams that accrue to the consumables business obviously are very important to the resiliency of the business model and also to margins. Relative to your question about customers willing to spend in CapEx, I'd say we have a number of examples where, even in challenging markets, our teams are performing quite well and seeing great penetration in terms of the installed base. I'd point to the Videojet business and the performance there, the continued growth of that installed base and the consumable stream. Clearly, what we've seen on the Diagnostics side, a little bit more favorable environment in terms of diagnostic utilization. The macro indicators around the healthcare market are improving marginally quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a little bit of loosening in capital spend in the hospital environment. As I mentioned, we saw the first quarter of returning to growth in Life Science in China, which is also encouraging. That's more of an equipment market than a consumables market. So I think there's a number of places we'd point to where we're seeing our teams execute extremely well and gaining share, driving that installed base without necessarily strong tailwinds from market perspectives."

And in general, as we've said for a long time now, we really believe quite strongly in the structural drivers of that market that there will be continued investment over time in the Chinese market in Life Sciences. And we've seen a number of examples of where the government maintains a consistent outlook that that's an important segment for investment, as are a number of other segments that we're well positioned, like in Environmental, like in different segments of healthcare, in Diagnostics as well as in Dental. So we think if we were to choose some segments in China where the government spending is likely to continue to be a focus, we think we've chosen those that are probably well -- best positioned."

We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a changing and challenging macroenvironment, using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue growth and expand core margins in the quarter. DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify, direct and execute on high-impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, 7 of our 9 strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter, including Test & Measurement instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation.
We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions, including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin that further boosted our performance.
This is another record first quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.93, including a negative $0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January. Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion, with core revenues up 5%, due in part to extra selling days in the quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011. Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues, while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%.
Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digits. But performance was mixed, as strength in China and India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. In China, sales increased nearly 10%, led by our Dental, Diagnostics and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms. The developed markets also grew at a mid-single-digit rate, with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digits. In Japan, as expected, sales declined double digits due to a difficult prior year comparison in which customers accelerated purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014.
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4%, marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core operating margin expanded 25 basis points or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency, with 3 of our 5 segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%.
On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on 3 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, including the acquisition of the Siemens microbiology business. These acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our Dental, Diagnostics and Product ID platforms.
In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share, and we expect further increases over time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel, combined with recent volatility in the global equity markets, uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues declined 1.5%, with core revenues up 2.5%. Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points and core operating margin declined 225 basis points, largely due to lower sales in our higher gross margin Communications platform.
Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, led by the developed markets and China. 
Fluke core revenues were up high single digits, as its biomedical and thermography product lines each increased double digits. Strength in thermography was augmented by the launch of the TiX560 and TiX520 series of thermal imaging cameras during the quarter. This expert series combines an articulating lens, on-camera analytics and the industry's largest responsive LCD touch screen, allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under and around objects to quickly capture process and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot.
At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in China. During the quarter, Tektronix introduced new high -- the new high performance ATI Oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented single-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion, so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Core revenues from our Communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security solutions and high single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions. 
Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we'll achieve positive core growth in 2015. We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015. And this morning, we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
Moving to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 7%, with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin expanded 175 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%.
Our Water Quality platforms core revenues grew approximately 10%, with robust growth in our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses.
Hach had an outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew double digit, as the team's application of DBS growth tools, such as funnel management and transformative marketing, continue to drive share gains. We built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough Water Quality testing system, the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, or PPA, in over 40 countries. Notably, the PPA's ease-of-use has already started to change the way our customers perform critical water quality tests, making it one of the most important new products in the market.
At ChemTreat, we saw a robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investments in feet on the street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job implementing this approach in Latin America, with its most recent acquisition, Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in the quarter.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in China and the U.S. In the U.S., upcoming EMV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We're pleased that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment system upgrades.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues grew 2%, with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by onetime noncash charges related to the recently closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens microbiology business, which is now known as Beckman Coulter-Microscan.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core sales were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines. 
In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates helped drive mid-single-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rates is an example of the team's persistent focus on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past 3-plus years. Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, lean and leadership tools can make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Brea, California in our Investor and Analyst event in June to hear more of this terrific story.
In January, Beckman closed the previously announced acquisition of Microscan. Microscan expands our well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate, automated instruments and consumables that help identify infection-causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments.
Radiometer's core sales increased high single digits, its 13th consecutive quarter of high-single-digit growth or better. Demand was solid across all product lines, led by double-digit growth in blood gas and AQT. During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of Procalcitonin -- the Procalcitonin assay, or PCT. PCT detects life-threatening sepsis infections on site, in operating rooms and other critical care centers, enabling doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives.
Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high single digits, led by advanced staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter. We posted double-digit growth in the U.S., where the stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved capital spending.
We were also encouraged by a strong start at Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December, where a reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools helped to drive approximately 10% growth in the quarter.
Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digits, with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe. Notably, we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter.
SCIEX core sales grew double digits, led by strength in clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in meaningful share gains over the past several quarters.
Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits due in part to a difficult comparison in Japan, where we saw record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we're confident in Leica's steady stream of new product innovation, including the DMi8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The DMi8 improves customer workflow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more quickly than with traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design, providing one solution for both basic and advanced industrial users.
Turning to Dental. Our Dental revenue increased 30%, with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin product lines. And combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development, resulted in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline. Robust demand in high-growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking. That said, we're encouraged by the improving sellout data we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of the year.
Nobel Biocare completed its first full quarter with Danaher, and we've made great progress so far. While still early, we were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single-digit average daily sales growth for the quarter.
One of Danaher's core values, Innovation Defines Our Future, certainly rang true at the biannual International Dental Show in March, where KaVo Kerr Group and Nobel Biocare launched more than 35 new or updated products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care from digital imaging to treatment units to consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated chair side CAD/CAM solution, which will allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices.
In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5%, with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded 185 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. 
Automation core revenues increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our industrial automation, North American distribution and medical end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance since early 2011.
Product Identification core revenues increased high single digits, with robust demand for our marking and coding, color management and software solutions. 
Videojet had a solid start to the year, delivering high-single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies, with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and 1650 High Resolution Micro Printers that enable fast high-quality printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care, where legibility and clarity are critical to consumer safety and industry regulations
In March, Esko acquired MediaBeacon, a leader in digital asset management software. MediaBeacon saves our customers time and money by allowing them to store, repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across projects, departments and channels. Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools.
So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015, delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The team's solid execution using the Danaher Business System continued to drive relative outperformance and enhance our competitive position. We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macroenvironment. However, we're confident that our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high-impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger Danaher in 2015 and the years to come. 
We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015."

And it's hard not to think that the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar is strengthened against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example, we continue to perform exceptionally well there. We have during the entire shift of the currency. We've seen solid mid-single-digit growth in that market. We know that market, generally across a number of our businesses, is probably more of a low-single-digit market on a core growth basis, and so we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there. We can look at Japan as another example where those shifts have happened and certainly there's been some modest shifts in the competitive dynamics there. But again, our business is generally -- in spite of a very challenging environment there overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're continuing to perform well. So we start there and think about competitiveness. Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we're going to see currencies move down. It takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. And the day you think you've got that right is the day a currency might turn against you, and you end up in a very different place than you had hoped. So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that has provided a certain level of natural hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and, therefore, the impacts have read through the P&L. So we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint, putting manufacturing operations in the best cost positions that we can, with the best logistics and supply chains. But these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning."

But generally, it starts with that volume position. And then the destocking, yes, in fact, was a primary driver relative to the higher-margin products being the areas where -- we, very cooperatively and teaming with our distribution channels, made very conscious decisions about what we needed to do in the channel from an inventory perspective. I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very closely with those distribution partners, and we're very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So we're confident in our competitive positions. We understand that we're performing well, that those distribution partnerships are working very effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting towards the end of that. Q2 is probably more of a transition quarter, and we're optimistic that we'll see better growth going forward. But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now one last point there, because we're confident in our competitive position, because in a number of areas, particularly outside the U.S., the Dental platform is performing extremely well, driving anywhere from mid-single digit to, in certain markets like China, growing double digits. We continue to invest in that business, investing in new products. You heard me talk about the 35 new products across the platform, investing in sales and marketing. So while we got some headwind there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay off as time goes on."

And I think on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places where we knew we were doing well. We knew that as things got choppy, continuing to invest and stay the course would ultimately prove out to our benefit on a long-term basis. I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that, staying that course, would be in Europe, again, where we've seen this lower-growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses, and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint. It's true today also in our high-growth markets, where we've seen a few of our markets, I'd cite specifically Latin America, specifically Brazil and Mexico, where we've got some challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint. But also making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investments carefully where there's higher growth opportunities, and there are some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job shifting that investment. Staying the course in China right now as well, staying the course in India from an investment standpoint. Both of those countries paying off very well for us across a number of the platforms. So staying the course, making some discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard to make sure we take advantage of what's a choppy environment."

Clearly, we're in some challenging macroeconomic times here. But again, we feel like the investments that we're making in the right places are driving core growth in a number of our businesses and translating into those share gains. And those are also businesses where we've got -- where we do have good gross margins, and we always look those gross margins and the improvement of those gross margins as indicative of higher-value propositions that we're delivering to our customers. Those are sometimes value propositions associated with new product innovations, sometimes they're associated with improvements in our technical service and support, our ability to get price across a number of our markets. So this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter after quarter and year after year. So that's the way we tend to think about it. And I would extend that, by the way, to the way we think about capital allocation, is looking at businesses and opportunities in the market that represent those same characteristics, good growth opportunities across global markets, high brand preference to professional end-users, representing solid gross margins and the ability to build sustainable business models with strong consumable streams that really speak to a level of resilience and ultimately, competitive advantage.

Both of those -- both sides of the house posting good growth.

Relative to your question about customers willing to spend in CapEx, I'd say we have a number of examples where, even in challenging markets, our teams are performing quite well and seeing great penetration in terms of the installed base. I'd point to the Videojet business and the performance there, the continued growth of that installed base and the consumable stream. Clearly, what we've seen on the Diagnostics side, a little bit more favorable environment in terms of diagnostic utilization. The macro indicators around the health-care market are improving marginally quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a little bit of loosening in capital spend in the hospital environment. As I mentioned, we saw the first quarter of returning to growth in Life Science in China, which is also encouraging. That's more of an equipment market than a consumables market.

I mentioned when we were together in December that we're much more focused on the existing 5 segments and 9 strategic platforms as they exist today and going deeper into those individual segments, strengthening each of them in terms of their competitive positions as opposed to going wider to the right or to the left. So I think that's probably the primary focus that we have across each of the platforms, is looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our positions in the markets in which we participate today. And I think you see a couple of examples there recently, right? Look at Siemens Micro, how that strengthened our position at Beckman. Look at Devicor, how that strengthened our position in the workflow of anatomical pathology. Most recently, MediaBeacon in our PID platform and the way that strengthened the value proposition of managing digital assets to brand owners. All good examples of strengthening a competitive position in the places we play today."

We saw a mid-single-digit growth in China in Life Science, again, the first really good signs of life there in terms of growth in the last few quarters. So we're encouraged by that. I think we've reached a point of probably stability there. A lot of what the government has done relative to the scrutiny that they've applied around tenders, we think has sort of now reached a kind of a level set or a steady-state in the market. There is, we believe, a little bit of a lift in spending overall as well. We are in the last year of the 12th fifth-year plan, and usually you get a little bit of a bump from a spending standpoint in that regard. And in general, as we've said for a long time now, we really believe quite strongly in the structural drivers of that market, that there will be continued investment over time in the Chinese market in Life Sciences. And we've seen a number of examples of where the government maintains a consistent outlook that that's an important segment for investment, as are a number of other segments that -- where we're well positioned, like in Environmental, like in different segments of health care, in Diagnostics as well as in Dental. So we think if we were to choose some segments in China where the government spending is likely to continue to be a focus, we think we've chosen those that are probably well -- best positioned."

This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. In M",2278,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning. This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and our intent to separate Danaher into 2 independent publicly traded companies. Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these 2 big announcements. First on Pall. The Transaction is progressing well. We received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments and look forward to closing the transaction later this year. 
On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created 2 strategically focused independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead.
With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion, while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5%, while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind.
Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth. 
Second quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments helped drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow-to-net-income conversion ratio was 137%.
We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal, but also 5 bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and midsize transactions.
Turning now to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth conservative quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits.
During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect asset system to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless-enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads.
Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter.
Core revenue in our Communications platform decreased at a low single-digit rate. Demand for our security solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1.
Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our Communications Business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a 9-month process in which we've brought together 2 complementary businesses to create 1 company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million. Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET and TekComms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout.
Moving now to Environmental. Revenue increased 2% with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our Water Quality platforms core revenue grew mid-single digits, with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses. Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad based with growth across most major product lines. In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Corporation. provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments.
At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class services sales in Latin America, with the acquisition of Group, a leading provider of industrial water and processed treatment solutions in Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single-digit. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia, where we had a significant project rollout last year. In the U.S., future EMV compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales for the quarter were up 3%, while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single digits, with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high-growth markets remained strong, with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East.
In Europe, we launched our Veris molecular diagnostic system along with 4 viral load assays. The streamlined design of the Veris system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease-of-use for our lab customers. Its sampling result out workflow provides test results in only 4 steps, thus requiring minimum training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over 2x faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods.
Those of you who attended our Analyst Meeting in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past 4 years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. This helped to exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly, with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed sources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth, including the acquisitions of IRIS and Microscan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall and believe we'll be able to run a similar playbook at Pall in the coming years.
Turning to Radiometer. Radiometer's core revenue increased high single digits with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at, where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer's sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a high single-digit rate with balanced growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Advanced staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position.
Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate led by double digit in the U.S, particularly offset -- partially offset by a decline in Latin America.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry Meeting, or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions, including bio BA. Bio BA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 mass spectrometer with the LC high-performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the bio pharma research workflow, enabling researchers to expand their skill set and improve their productivity.
Leica Microsystems core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive, giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter.
During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Biooxygen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina.
Turning to Dental. Core sales were up 1%, while total revenues increased 30%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly with operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring.
Growth in Dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we are encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter.
We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's International Dental Show in Germany. KaVo's updated master series of hand pieces would provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patent access angle for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance.
Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5%, while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segments core margin improved over 110 basis points. 
Our Automation platforms core revenue grew low single digits led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe.
Core revenues for Product Identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business.
Videojet grew high single digits led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables. Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth or better across the U.S., Europe and China.
Esko core sales improved high single digits led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging with sales up over 30%.
X-Rite had a strong quarter, in which demand for our color measurement and standard products drove high single-digit growth.
So to wrap it up, we are very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our teams' outstanding execution using the Danaher Business System helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macroenvironment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come.
We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter 2015. We are also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.43 -- $4.33. 
As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications Business will be reclassified as discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications Business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full year 2015 guidance would represent high single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth."

Trojan, a little bit more CapEx exposure. Had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We are starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis. And this is a lumpy business given the project major more CapEx-oriented. But generally, we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is.

Dental has a function of very modest core growth, growing 1%, tougher to expand those margins. We'll need a little better core growth to see core margin expansion here in the second half."

We think about it in terms of a more -- a truly more of a healthcare-oriented market, the term you used, that would impact our diagnostic businesses more. And then more of a life science market that is more skewed towards selling to life science-related academic and research institutions, universities, pharma, big pharma, food testing, et cetera. So first and foremost, we sort of separated into those 2 segments of the market. Specific to your question about our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well. Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high-growth market challenges, had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. And that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macroenvironment. Back on the healthcare side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increased very modestly. Generally, hospitals are in better shape financially today. So we've seen some investment coming through. And so, I think that's certainly a little bit of a help. But again, I would point to our execution improvements in Beckman's overall performance. Certainly, Radiometer, a consistent performer. Leica Biosystems growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core Histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in the utilization."

Our team executed well using the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. In",2287,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning. This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. 
In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and our intent to separate Danaher into 2 independent publicly traded companies. Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these 2 big announcements. 
First on Pall. The transaction is progressing well. We received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments and look forward to closing the transaction later this year. 
On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created 2 strategically focused independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead. With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. 
Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5%, while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind.
Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth. 
Second quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments helped drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio was 137%.
We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal but also 5 bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front, with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and midsized transactions.
Turning now to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth conservative quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits.
During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect asset system to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless-enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads.
Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter.
Core revenue in our Communications platform decreased at a low single-digit rate. Demand for our security solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1.
Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our Communications business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a 9-month process in which we've brought together 2 complementary businesses to create one company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million. 
Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET and TekComms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout.
Moving now to Environmental. Revenue increased 2%, with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our Water Quality platform's core revenue grew mid-single digits, with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses. 
Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad-based, with growth across most major product lines. 
In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Sutron Corporation. Sutron provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments.
At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class service and sales in Latin America, with the acquisition of Limpieza Group [ph], a leading provider of industrial water and processed treatment solutions in Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single digits. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia, where we had a significant project rollout last year. In the U.S., future EMV compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales for the quarter were up 3% while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single digits, with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high-growth markets remained strong, with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East.
In Europe, we launched our Veris molecular diagnostic system along with 4 viral load assays. The streamlined design of the Veris system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease-of-use for our lab customers. Its sample-in, result-out workflow provides test results in only 4 steps, thus requiring minimum training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over 2x faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods.
Those of you who attended our Analyst Day in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past 4 years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. 
This effort has helped us exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly, with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed resources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth, including the acquisitions of IRIS and Microscan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall and believe we'll be able to run a similar playbook at Pall in the coming years.
Turning to Radiometer. Radiometer's core revenue increased high single digits, with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at HemoCue where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired HemoCue in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer's sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with balanced growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Advanced staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position.
Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate, led by double digit in the U.S., particularly offset -- partially offset by a decline in Latin America.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting, or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions, including BioBA. BioBA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with the AxION LC high-performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the biopharma research workflow, enabling researchers to expand their skill set and improve their productivity.
Leica Microsystems core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive, giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter.
During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Bioptigen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of Bioptigen's advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina.
Turning to Dental. Core sales were up 1% while total revenues increased 30%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points, with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly, with the operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring.
Growth in Dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we are encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter.
We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's International Dental Show in Germany. KaVo's updated Master Series of hand pieces, which provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patented access angles for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance.
Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segment's core margin improved over 110 basis points. 
Our Automation platform's core revenue grew low single digits, led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe.
Core revenues for Product Identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business.
Videojet grew high single digits, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables. Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth or better across the U.S., Europe and China.
Esko core sales improved high single digits, led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging, with sales up over 30%.
X-Rite had a strong quarter in which demand for our color measurement and standards products drove high single-digit growth.
So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our teams' outstanding execution using the Danaher Business System helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macroenvironment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come.
We're initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter of 2015. We are also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.43 -- $4.33. 
As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications business will be reclassified to discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full year 2015 guidance would represent high single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth."

I just mentioned their growth in China at double digits on the quarter. But continued good performance in the developed markets, specifically obviously in the U.S. and in Europe. And in general, that would span across industrial and muni. So I think we're seeing pretty good progress there. They continue to invest in growth both on the sales and marketing side as well as in R&D, and I think we're seeing the benefits of consistent year-over-year investment in that business and very, very good execution. If you look at Trojan, Trojan more on the equipment side, keep in mind that Hach is a little bit more of an OpEx-related business, a little bit less CapEx exposure. Trojan, a little bit more CapEx exposure, had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We're starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis. And this is a lumpy business, given the project nature, more CapEx-oriented. But generally, we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is. They -- we've talked a number of times about the investments that we've made in ballast water. We've noted that we filed formally for a U.S. type approval via the Coast Guard. We're waiting for any questions or follow-up on that filing, but we remain encouraged about the potential for growth there. And then finally at ChemTreat, another good quarter at ChemTreat, performing very well. Probably faces a few more challenging pockets in the macroenvironment. There actually is a little bit of oil and gas exposure in that business. We've had some success up in the oil sands in Canada. And so we've seen some softness there. The steel market has been a little bit more challenging. So while ChemTreat continues to grow very positively and gain share, there's a few pockets of softness there that we'll need to offset."

So first and foremost, we sort of separated into those 2 segments of the market. Specific to your question about the Life -- our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well. Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high-growth market challenges, had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. And that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macroenvironment. Back on the health care side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increase very modestly. Generally, hospitals are in better shape financially today. So we've seen some investment coming through. And so I think that's certainly a little bit of a help, but again, I would point to our execution improvements in Beckman's overall performance. Certainly, Radiometer, a consistent performer. Leica Biosystems, growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in utilization."

  Thanks, Matt, and good morning. This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. 
In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and our intent to separate Danaher into 2 independent publicly traded companies. Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these 2 big announcements. 
First on Pall. The transaction is progressing well. We've received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments and look forward to closing the transaction later this year. 
On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created 2 strategically focused independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead. With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. 
Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5%, while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind.
Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth. 
Second quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments helped drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio was 137%.
We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal but also 5 bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front, with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and midsized transactions.
Turning now to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth conservative quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits.
During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect asset system to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless-enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads.
Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter.
Core revenue in our Communications platform decreased at a low single-digit rate. Demand for our security solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1.
Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our Communications business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a 9-month process in which we've brought together 2 complementary businesses to create one company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million. 
Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET and TekComms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout.
Moving now to Environmental. Revenue increased 2%, with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our Water Quality platform's core revenue grew mid-single digits, with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses. 
Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad-based, with growth across most major product lines. 
In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Sutron Corporation. Sutron provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments.
At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class service and sales in Latin America, with the acquisition of Limpieza Group [ph], a leading provider of industrial water and processed treatment solutions in Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single digits. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia, where we had a significant project rollout last year. In the U.S., future EMV compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales for the quarter were up 3% while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single digits, with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high-growth markets remained strong, with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East.
In Europe, we launched our Veris molecular diagnostic system along with 4 viral load assays. The streamlined design of the Veris system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease-of-use for our lab customers. Its sample-in, result-out workflow provides test results in only 4 steps, thus requiring minimum training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over 2x faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods.
Those of you who attended our Analyst Day in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past 4 years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. 
This effort has helped us exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly, with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed resources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth, including the acquisitions of IRIS and Microscan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall and believe we'll be able to run a similar playbook at Pall in the coming years.
Turning to Radiometer. Radiometer's core revenue increased high single digits, with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at HemoCue where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired HemoCue in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer's sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with balanced growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Advanced staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position.
Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate, led by double digit in the U.S., particularly offset -- partially offset by a decline in Latin America.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting, or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions, including BioBA. BioBA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with the AxION LC high-performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the biopharma research workflow, enabling researchers to expand their skill set and improve their productivity.
Leica Microsystems core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive, giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter.
During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Bioptigen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of Bioptigen's advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina.
Turning to Dental. Core sales were up 1% while total revenues increased 30%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points, with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly, with the operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring.
Growth in Dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we are encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter.
We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's International Dental Show in Germany. KaVo's updated Master Series of hand pieces, which provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patented access angles for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance.
Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segment's core margin improved over 110 basis points. 
Our Automation platform's core revenue grew low single digits, led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe.
Core revenues for Product Identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business.
Videojet grew high single digits, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables. Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth or better across the U.S., Europe and China.
Esko core sales improved high single digits, led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging, with sales up over 30%.
X-Rite had a strong quarter in which demand for our color measurement and standards products drove high single-digit growth.
So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our teams' outstanding execution using the Danaher Business System helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macro-environment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come.
We're initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter of 2015. We are also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.43 -- $4.33. 
As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications business will be reclassified to discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full year 2015 guidance would represent high single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth."

  Like -- just want to echo Steve's comments, so boring is good. I think this quarter is going to stack up very well versus the pack. So just wanted to focus a little bit on margin here because I think that is the real swing from 1Q where you had a little bit of softness on FX, and conversion this quarter is much, much better. So I wondered maybe if you could talk about whether the impact of FX moderated, whether that was offset by efficiency metrics. And if I could just then drill into the core Test & Measurement margins, outstanding margins. Looks to be about 24 and change, that's up about 3 points year-over-year. How sustainable is that? And is that driven by mix? Is that restructuring? What's driving that strength?"

Nigel, on that, we're clearly continuing to feel the impact of the FX on our margin. We've got -- until we anniversary the big move in the euro, that will continue. But overall, very good kind of cost actions fall through. One of the dynamics in Q2, our consumable business aftermarket core growth remained very, very healthy. Our equipment business was slightly softer. I think that's not unlike what we're hearing from a lot of other more equipment-based businesses, so we can actually get a favorable mix from that from a margin perspective. But the FX impact is still very much there."

I think we are -- we feel very good about how well our portfolio is positioned to weather storms in various markets. Today, I think we're certainly cognizant of the headlines. We've seen the high-growth markets become very uneven. While we're still seeing relative strength and excellent execution in places like China and the Middle East, we're very cognizant of the weaknesses in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, the challenges in Russia. And yet I think in many cases, in the overall, we're performing quite well. As we said in the last couple of calls, our businesses are really well positioned in Europe. We don't see Europe as a particularly robust market at the moment, but we continue to post good growth across a number of our businesses. The U.S. has been steady for us. But again, I think we would look to our own execution as being the underpinnings of that and not so much any great confidence in macro stability going forward."

It's in the -- probably the 3% to 4% range, again, will vary a bit across product categories. But I think sellout continues to be good. I think as we look at consumables and equipment, generally a number of areas performing better than they were.

  Sure. Absolutely, Jeff. Let's start with the Hach business. The Hach business has -- continues to perform very well. Another very good quarter. I just mentioned their growth in China at double digits on the quarter. But continued good performance in the developed markets, specifically obviously in the U.S. and in Europe. And in general, that would span across industrial and muni. So I think we're seeing pretty good progress there. They continue to invest in growth both on the sales and marketing side as well as in R&D, and I think we're seeing the benefits of consistent year-over-year investment in that business and very, very good execution. If you look at Trojan, Trojan more on the equipment side, keep in mind that Hach is a little bit more of an OpEx-related business, a little bit less CapEx exposure. Trojan, a little bit more CapEx exposure, had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We're starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis. And this is a lumpy business, given the project nature, more CapEx-oriented. But generally, we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is. They -- we've talked a number of times about the investments that we've made in ballast water. We've noted that we filed formally for a U.S. Type Approval via the Coast Guard. We're waiting for any questions or follow-up on that filing, but we remain encouraged about the potential for growth there. And then finally at ChemTreat, another good quarter at ChemTreat, performing very well. Probably faces a few more challenging pockets in the macro-environment. There actually is a little bit of oil and gas exposure in that business. We've had some success up in the oil sands in Canada. And so we've seen some softness there. The steel market has been a little bit more challenging. So while ChemTreat continues to grow very positively and gain share, there's a few pockets of softness there that we'll need to offset."

So first and foremost, we sort of separate it into those 2 segments of the market. Specific to your question about the Life -- our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well. Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high-growth market challenges, had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. And that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macro-environment. Back on the health care side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increase very modestly. Generally, hospitals are in better shape financially today. So we've seen some investment coming through. And so I think that's certainly a little bit of a help, but again, I would point to our execution improvements in Beckman's overall performance. Certainly, Radiometer, a consistent performer. Leica Biosystems, growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in utilization."

  So I thought I'd start -- just you were talking a bit about Life Sciences, digging in just a little more on the biopharma side, it's obviously going to get more important when you close Pall.

As we, I think, pointed out in a number of our conversations about the Pall transaction, we see the biopharma market to be one of the most attractive markets from a sustainable growth perspective in the years to come. You saw that in Pall's reported numbers coming out of there last quarter. So we feel very good about the growth prospects there. Specific to our business, I would probably point to SCIEX specifically. That's a business that performed very well. Their approach to that market is broad-based in terms of the full range of pharma customers. And we continue to see good growth. They were one of our best performers in the Life Science platform and, specifically, a very strong performer in North America. So we remain very bullish on that market."

  Thanks, Julian. Product ID, specifically Videojet, I'll start with Videojet, has performed very well. I would say that it is largely a function of some very strong DBS-oriented execution at VJ. Some of the growth-oriented tools of DBS that we've spoken about in the past, tools around funnel management and transformative marketing, have really been developed and brought to maturity at Videojet. And we've seen the impact of the utilization of those tools in their commercial execution and the resulting growth performance and share gains. So it's a great job by that team, and I think we'll continue to see good performance there. That performance is replicated or is very similar when we look at Esko and X-Rite, 2 terrific acquisitions that the platform has done, really broadening its footprint and bringing a broader suite of solutions to brand owners. And so I think all is tracking in the right direction in terms of the platform. Relative to Domino, we have not seen any particular impact to that. The PID business in general and VJ specifically is performing exceptionally well in Europe. And so I think we're in good shape."

Our team executed well using the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. 
In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and our intent to separate Danaher into 2 independent publicly traded companies. Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these 2 big announcements. 
First on Pall. The transaction is progressing well. We've received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments and look forward to closing the transaction later this year. 
On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created 2 strategically focused independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead. With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. 
Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5%, while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind.
Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth. 
Second quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments helped drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio was 137%.
We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal but also 5 bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front, with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and midsized transactions.
Turning now to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth conservative quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits.
During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect asset system to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless-enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads.
Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter.
Core revenue in our Communications platform decreased at a low single-digit rate. Demand for our security solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1.
Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our Communications business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a 9-month process in which we've brought together 2 complementary businesses to create one company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million. 
Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET and TekComms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout.
Moving now to Environmental. Revenue increased 2%, with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our Water Quality platform's core revenue grew mid-single digits, with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment and ultraviolet treatment businesses. 
Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad-based, with growth across most major product lines. 
In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Sutron Corporation. Sutron provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments.
At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class service and sales in Latin America, with the acquisition of Limpieza Group [ph], a leading provider of industrial water and processed treatment solutions in Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single digits. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia, where we had a significant project rollout last year. In the U.S., future EMV compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales for the quarter were up 3% while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single digits, with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high-growth markets remained strong, with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East.
In Europe, we launched our Veris molecular diagnostic system along with 4 viral load assays. The streamlined design of the Veris system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease-of-use for our lab customers. Its sample-in, result-out workflow provides test results in only 4 steps, thus requiring minimum training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over 2x faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods.
Those of you who attended our Analyst Day in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past 4 years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. 
This effort has helped us exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly, with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed resources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth, including the acquisitions of IRIS and Microscan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall and believe we'll be able to run a similar playbook at Pall in the coming years.
Turning to Radiometer. Radiometer's core revenue increased high single digits, with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at HemoCue where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired HemoCue in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer's sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with balanced growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Advanced staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position.
Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate, led by double digit in the U.S., particularly offset -- partially offset by a decline in Latin America.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting, or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions, including BioBA. BioBA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with the AxION LC high-performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the biopharma research workflow, enabling researchers to expand their skill set and improve their productivity.
Leica Microsystems core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive, giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter.
During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Bioptigen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of Bioptigen's advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina.
Turning to Dental. Core sales were up 1% while total revenues increased 30%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points, with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly, with the operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring.
Growth in Dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we are encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter.
We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's International Dental Show in Germany. KaVo's updated Master Series of hand pieces, which provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patented access angles for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance.
Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segment's core margin improved over 110 basis points. 
Our Automation platform's core revenue grew low single digits, led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe.
Core revenues for Product Identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business.
Videojet grew high single digits, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables. Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth or better across the U.S., Europe and China.
Esko core sales improved high single digits, led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging, with sales up over 30%.
X-Rite had a strong quarter in which demand for our color measurement and standards products drove high single-digit growth.
So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our teams' outstanding execution using the Danaher Business System helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macro-environment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come.
We're initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter of 2015. We are also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.43 -- $4.33. 
As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications business will be reclassified to discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full year 2015 guidance would represent high single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth."

It's in the -- probably the 3% to 4% range, again, will vary a bit across product categories. But I think sellout continues to be good. I think as we look at consumables and equipment, generally a number of areas performing better than they were. Still some work to do, but we think we're approaching the tail end of some inventory-related destocking activities that impacted primarily the equipment side and were more or less isolated to the North American market.

I just mentioned their growth in China at double digits on the quarter. But continued good performance in the developed markets, specifically obviously in the U.S. and in Europe. And in general, that would span across industrial and muni. So I think we're seeing pretty good progress there. They continue to invest in growth both on the sales and marketing side as well as in R&D, and I think we're seeing the benefits of consistent year-over-year investment in that business and very, very good execution. If you look at Trojan, Trojan more on the equipment side, keep in mind that Hach is a little bit more of an OpEx-related business, a little bit less CapEx exposure. Trojan, a little bit more CapEx exposure, had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We're starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis. And this is a lumpy business, given the project nature, more CapEx-oriented. But generally, we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is. They -- we've talked a number of times about the investments that we've made in ballast water. We've noted that we filed formally for a U.S. Type Approval via the Coast Guard. We're waiting for any questions or follow-up on that filing, but we remain encouraged about the potential for growth there. And then finally at ChemTreat, another good quarter at ChemTreat, performing very well. Probably faces a few more challenging pockets in the macro-environment. There actually is a little bit of oil and gas exposure in that business. We've had some success up in the oil sands in Canada. And so we've seen some softness there. The steel market has been a little bit more challenging. So while ChemTreat continues to grow very positively and gain share, there's a few pockets of softness there that we'll need to offset."

So first and foremost, we sort of separate it into those 2 segments of the market. Specific to your question about the Life -- our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well. Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high-growth market challenges, had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. And that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macro-environment. Back on the health care side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increase very modestly. Generally, hospitals are in better shape financially today. So we've seen some investment coming through. And so I think that's certainly a little bit of a help, but again, I would point to our execution improvements in Beckman's overall performance. Certainly, Radiometer, a consistent performer. Leica Biosystems, growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in utilization."

265621,312030868,879364,"Danaher Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning. Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We are pleased with our team's execution, which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow.

We are pleased with our team's execution, which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to market initiatives led to mid-single-digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco.
We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter, we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies, we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016.
So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5%, while currency translation was a 7% headwind.
Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single-digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid-single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed, with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first-half levels, but still grew mid-single digits in the quarter.
Third quarter gross margin is 52.5% and increased 40 basis points or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points, and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter.
We are also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced 9 acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first 9 months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong, and we expect to focus our activity on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand at Danaher, and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we are seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies.
So now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits as strength in our biomedical and calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America. Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continue to lead the market as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO 70000 FX this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Moving to Environmental. Revenue increased 1%, with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platform's core revenue increased mid-single digits, with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business and drive customer loyalty.
At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enable customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before.
ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies. In spite of a challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions, Aguasin and .
Trojan also had a solid quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market.
Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root. GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single-digit revenue growth as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double-digit sales and order growth and point-of-sales solutions and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulation to drive demand at GVR for the next several years.
Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales were up 14.5%, while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer uptime, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care.
At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid-single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double-digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business. This August, we celebrated Leica's 10 year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly 8x the operating profit it had in 2005.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. High single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high-growth markets.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and triple quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of a 6500 plus series. Offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500 plus helps researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive, and sales since launch had exceeded our expectations.
Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV 6 digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV 6 enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in 3 configurations, which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs.
Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin, while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%.
Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results. Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid-single-digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive its success and, during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th clinician customer.
Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses. During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step sonic activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth.
Turning to Industrial Technologies, sales decreased 6.5%, while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%. 
Our Automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits, with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending.
Product Identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coating products, which grew mid-single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region.
Videojet grew mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and, year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the M600 OEM. The M600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders and the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions and expanded control options for critical coating operation -- applications.
So in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macroenvironment, we continue to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with our teams' steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System, will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond.
Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by 4 fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies a year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%."

Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. There are some pockets regionally, where we've seen some of that slowing clearly and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we have seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally the portfolio is very well-positioned. It clearly differentiates us and, generally, we think when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we've got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trendlines. But our bias is to build on our strengths. And despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent on a days adjusted basis anyway with what we've seen here in the late going in September."

So we've seen some activity going on throughout each of the quarters of the year. And while as we go through the fourth quarter we may do a little bit more than we initially anticipated, those plans are sort of still in the works here. But we think overall that, that plan will be pretty consistent, maybe a little bit higher. Obviously, there'll be some Pall contributions to that activity.

We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad, and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives. Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On life science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectation. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again probably to be expected given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in the Industrial business. So incremental weakening but understandably so given those vertical markets. Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall.

We're really happy with what's going on there. The team has done an excellent job. The average daily sales rate continuing to trend very well. New product introductions coming out on schedule with a strong cadence, great acceptance in the marketplace, good progress across various regions. So all in, we are super happy with the start there and team's doing well. But on to the core of your question. Probably important to think about it in terms of the consumable side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We made a lot of progress, which we had talked about throughout the course of this year on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sellout, and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sellout data. I contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side, it's the inventory rightsizing and the channel has taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases particularly in the high-growth markets where it's a little bit more project-oriented. Now the key thing that we look at though when we look through those numbers is we look at the sellout numbers. And the sellout numbers are, on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market certainly. So we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and again a little high-growth market headwind."

It seems to be an environment where Danaher could really provide some liquidity and pick up some decent assets at good prices, but you did comment that you were looking at more small stuff.

For the right strategic transaction, for the transaction, for the asset, the business that really strengthens us strategically, that adds a level of competitive advantage, that provides a greater level of growth rate on a long-term basis, we would do the right thing from the standpoint of whether that's going into the markets as we did so effectively to finance the Pall transaction or set up the balance sheet in a way that would allow us to do that. So I don't -- my comment should not mean to suggest that there's a bright line that snapped at a certain point beyond which we wouldn't go.

If you take we've got $5 billion of revenue and 25% of that is in the high-growth market, not all of that's in local currency but most of it, call it $1 billion of it is in local currency, that's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan index which is they track the top 10 emerging-market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter from the beginning of July to the end of September. But call that a weighted average of a 5% decline. If you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenue, that's $50 million of revenue that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenue, you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency, so you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit."

But commodities, given our growth gross margin profile, commodities will not play a big impact on our cost of goods sold. The one area where I would've thought we would have actually gotten more of a benefit than we have is actually on the logistics side. Clearly, fuel prices have come down, but the package -- the transport companies have been pretty sticky about reducing prices. Now again I think as demand gets a little weaker here, maybe that helps. So it's been a benefit today, but just given our product makeup, it's not been -- the commodity side doesn't help or hurt us as much as most industrial companies."

Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities. And so I think as we look at China, we really continue to look at a number of sectors in that market where our businesses are extremely well positioned and where the sectors themselves are really quite attractive. So clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be.

In the case of Pall, specifically, it's about 1/3 of their business is biopharma related. The growth rate there continued to be very strong throughout the course of the quarter. These are critical applications that to some extent are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside those facilities. In other words, whether you're making a large volume or a small volume, you're still going to be running that equipment and consuming some of our products. On the research side, the research investments, while they are shifting around a bit, continue to be relatively good.

It's interesting because we can talk about as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis. But today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last 3 or 4 years where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S., today we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last 3 or 4 years. So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to, certainly to Hach, as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year, and we've seen overall revenue converting that business -- that bidding activity into revenue of this year as well. So probably one of the better market where we participate today. And clearly with leading positions, we believe we are gaining share in Water Quality. In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is -- it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have -- we have the teams at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology where bringing filtration as well as treatment together maybe a great opportunity for customers. So it's early days there. We're really just getting into the 100 day strategic plan across those vertical markets, but it is a good position to start with, and we'll see what we can do."

265621,312030868,879648,"Danaher Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning. Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We're pleased with our team's execution, which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw t",2006,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning. Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We're pleased with our team's execution, which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to market initiatives led to mid-single-digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco.
We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter, we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies, we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016.
So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5%, while currency translation was a 7% headwind.
Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single-digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid-single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed, with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first half levels, but still grew mid-single digits in the quarter.
Third quarter gross margin was 52.5%. It increased 40 basis points or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points, and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter.
We're also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced 9 acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first 9 months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong, and we expect to focus our activity on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand at Danaher, and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we're seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies.
So now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits, as strength in our biomedical and calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America.
Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high-performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continue to lead the market, as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion, so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Moving to Environmental. Revenue increased 1%, with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platform's core revenue increased mid-single digits, with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid-single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business and drive customer loyalty.
At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enable customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before.
ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies. In spite of a challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions, Aguasin and Lipesa.
Trojan also had a solid quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market.
Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root. GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single-digit revenue growth, as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double-digit sales and order growth and point-of-sales solution and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulation to drive demand at GVR for the next several years.
Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales were up 14.5%, while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer uptime, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care.
At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid-single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double-digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business.
This August, we celebrated Leica's 10 year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly 8x the operating profit it had in 2005.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. High single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high-growth markets.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and triple quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of a 6500 plus series. Offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500 plus helps researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive, and sales since launch have exceeded our expectations.
Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid-single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV 6 digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV 6 enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in 3 configurations, which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs.
Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin, while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%.
Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results. Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid-single-digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive its success and, during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th clinician customer.
Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses. During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step sonic activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth.
Turning to Industrial Technologies. Sales decreased 6.5%, while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%.
Our Automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits, with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending.
Product Identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coding products, which grew mid-single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region.
Videojet grew mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and, year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the m600 oem. The m600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions and expanded control options for critical coding operation -- applications.
So in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macroenvironment, we've continued to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with our teams' steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System, will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond.
Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by 4 fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%."

Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. It's -- there are some pockets regionally, where we've seen some of that slowing clearly and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we have seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally the portfolio is very well positioned. It clearly differentiates us. And generally, we think when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening, but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trendlines. But our bias is to build on our strengths. And despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent on a days adjusted basis anyway with what we've seen here in the late going in September."

We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad, and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives. Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On Life Science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectation. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again probably to be expected given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in the Industrial business. So incremental weakening, but understandably so given those vertical markets. Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall. But obviously, that will impact the offset to some extent by any of the cost actions that we'll take and the investments that we'll make."

Team has done an excellent job. The average daily sales rates continuing to trend very well. New product introductions coming out on schedule with a strong cadence. Great acceptance in the marketplace. Good progress across various regions. So all in, we're super happy with the start there and team is doing well. But on to your -- the core of your question, probably important to think about it in terms of the consumable side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We've made a lot of progress, which we have had talked about throughout the course of this year on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sellout and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sellout data. I contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side, it's the inventory rightsizing and the channel has taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases, particularly, in the high-growth markets where it's a little bit more project-oriented. Now the key thing that we look at though, when we look through those numbers, is we look at the sellout numbers. And the sellout numbers are -- on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market, certainly. So we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and again a little high-growth market headwind."

It seems to be an environment where Danaher could really provide some liquidity and pick up some decent assets at good prices, but you did comment that you were looking at more small and mid-ish stuff.

If you take, we've got $5 billion of revenues and 25% of that's in the high-growth market, not all of that's in local currency but most of it, call it $1 billion of it in local currency. That's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan index, which is they track the top 10 emerging-market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter from the beginning of July to the end of September. To call that weighted average of a 5% decline. So you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenue, that's $50 million of revenue that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenues, and you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency. So you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit."

Clearly, fuel prices have come down, but the package -- the transport companies have been pretty sticky about reducing prices.

Our growth rates continue to be very good in a number of our businesses. Specifically, in our Diagnostic business, we continue to grow extremely well in China. We've seen some of the slowing that we had talked about around tenders for Life Science over a period of time. That money has freed up, not perhaps to the same rate that we would have hoped by this point. But certainly, we're seeing a better environment for Life Science spending. Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities. And so I think as we look at China, we really continue to look at a number of sectors in that market, where our businesses are extremely well positioned and where the sectors themselves are really quite attractive. So clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be. But our Environmental businesses, our Life Science, Diagnostic businesses are well positioned, and we still feel very good about those.

In the case of Pall, specifically, it's about 1/3 of their business is biopharma-related. The growth rate there continued to be very strong throughout the course of the quarter. These are critical applications that to some extent are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside of those facilities. In other words, whether you're making a large volume or a small volume, you're still going to be running that equipment and consuming some of our products.

It's interesting because you talk -- we can talk about as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis. But today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last 3 or 4 years, where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S. Today, we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last 3 or 4 years. So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to -- certainly to Hach Lange as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year, and we've seen overall revenue converting that business -- that bidding activity into revenue of this year as well. So probably one of the better markets where we participate today. And clearly with leading positions, we believe we're gaining share in Water Quality. In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is -- it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have the teams at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology. We are bringing filtration as well as ultraviolet treatments together, maybe a great opportunity for our customers. So it's early days there.

265621,312030868,879767,"Danaher Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning. Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We're pleased with our team's execution, which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw t",2002,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning. Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We're pleased with our team's execution, which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives led to mid-single-digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco.
We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter, we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies, we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016.
So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5%, while currency translation was a 7% headwind.
Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single-digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid-single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed, with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first half levels, but still grew mid-single digits in the quarter.
Third quarter gross margin was 52.5%. It increased 40 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points, and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter.
We're also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced 9 acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first 9 months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong, and we expect to focus our activity on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand at Danaher, and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we're seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies.
So now turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2%, while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits, as strength in our biomedical and calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America.
Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high-performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continue to lead the market, as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion, so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Moving to Environmental. Revenue increased 1%, with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platform's core revenue increased mid-single digits, with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid-single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business and drive customer loyalty.
At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enables customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before.
ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies. In spite of a challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions, Aguasin and Lipesa.
Trojan also had a solid quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market.
Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root. GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single-digit revenue growth, as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double-digit sales and order growth in point-of-sales solutions and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulations to drive demand at GVR for the next several years.
Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Sales were up 14.5%, while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth.
Our Diagnostics platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits, driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low-volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer uptime, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care.
At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid-single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate, as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double-digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business.
This August, we celebrated Leica's 10-year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly 8x the operating profit it had in 2005.
Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. High single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high-growth markets.
SCIEX core sales grew mid-single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and triple-quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of the 6500 plus series. Offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500 plus helps researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive, and sales since launch have exceeded our expectations.
Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly, as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid-single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in 3 configurations, which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs.
Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin, while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%.
Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results. Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid-single-digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive this success and, during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th clinician customer.
Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses. During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step sonic-activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth.
Turning to Industrial Technologies. Sales decreased 6.5%, while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%.
Our Automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits, with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending.
Product Identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coding products, which grew mid-single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region.
Videojet grew mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and, year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the m600 oem. The m600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions and expanded control options for critical coding operation -- applications.
So in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macroenvironment, we've continued to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with our teams' steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System, will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond.
Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by 4 fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%."

Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. It's -- there are some pockets regionally, where we've seen some of that slowing clearly, and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we have seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally the portfolio is very well positioned. It clearly differentiates us. And generally, we think when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening, but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trend lines. But our bias is to build on our strengths. And despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent, on a days-adjusted basis anyway, with what we've seen here in the late going in September."

We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad, and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives. Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On Life Science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectation. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again, probably to be expected given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in the Industrial business. So incremental weakening, but understandably so given those vertical markets. Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall.

Great acceptance in the marketplace. Good progress across various regions. So all in, we're super happy with the start there and the team is doing well. But on to your -- the core of your question, probably important to think about it in terms of the consumable side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We've made a lot of progress, which we have had talked about throughout the course of this year, on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sellout, and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sellout data. I contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side, it's the inventory rightsizing in the channel has taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases, particularly in the high-growth markets where it's a little bit more project-oriented. Now the key thing that we look at though, when we look through those numbers, is we look at the sellout numbers. And the sellout numbers are -- on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market, certainly. So we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and again, a little high-growth market headwind."

If you take -- we've got $5 billion of revenues and 25% of that's in the high-growth markets. Not all of that's in local currency but most of it -- call it $1 billion of it in local currency. That's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan index, which is they track the top 10 emerging-market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter, from the beginning of July to the end of September. So call that a weighted average of a 5% decline. So you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenue. That's $50 million of revenue that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenues, and you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency. So you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit."

Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities.

So clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be.

These are critical applications that, to some extent, are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside of those facilities.

So specific to municipal budgets and the overall municipal water market as a growth market, it's interesting because you talk -- when you talk about it as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis. But today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last 3 or 4 years, where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S., today, we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last 3 or 4 years. So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to -- certainly to Hach Lange, as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year, and we've seen overall revenue converting that business -- that bidding activity into revenue up this year as well. So probably one of the better markets where we participate today. And clearly with leading positions, we believe we're gaining share in Water Quality. In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is -- it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have the teams at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology, where bringing filtration as well as ultraviolet treatments together may be a great opportunity for our customers. So it's early days there. We're really just getting into the 100-day strategic plans across those vertical markets, but it is a good position to start with, and we'll see what we can do."
