Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York.

Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $10.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year or about 23% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.85, up 23% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $10.10 per share in our guidance for the quarter.
For the full year, The Priceline Group reported gross bookings of just over $50 billion, $346 million room nights, $3.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $53.31, all up about 28% year-over-year.
Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel  supply at Booking.com, which now has over 600,000 hotels and other accommodations in 212 countries and territories, up 41% over last year. Booking.com continues to invest aggressively in its global supply platform, building substantially differentiated hotel and accommodation supply, content and availability.  Much of that growth in supply is driven by the Vacation Rental, which might than doubled 247,000 properties, including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels, and other self-catered products, all of which are instantly confirmable.
It is important to note that because many of our vacationable properties have multiple units, our 247,000 properties actually represent over 1 million instantly bookable and confirmable units within these properties.
We continue to believe in the large untapped potential of the global Vacation Rental opportunities, which is historically been written by a high friction research and fulfillment process. 
In addition to aggressively growing our number of accommodation partners, the group invested nearly $2.6 billion in marketing during the year. While the preponderance of that investment was an online channels, Booking.com continue to build its off-line competencies. Following successful TV launches in the U.S. and Australia in 2013, we also ran effective campaigns in the U.K., Canada and Germany.
We are pleased with the return on total advertising we're seeing in these markets, and we'll continue to explore new markets where the data tells us it makes sense to diversify our ad spend.
2014 was a tale of 2 cities for priceline.com, with solid growth in its retail businesses offset by declines I its OPEC businesses. We believe the pressure in OPEC is reflective of a historically healthy overall travel environment in the United States, which is beneficial to the balance of our group-wide business.
The fast-growing Asia-Pacific market was another critical component to the group's success in 2014. We believe Agoda.com and Booking.com leave the region an intra-asian hotel and accommodation bookings, and we're no harvesting the fruit of our new commercial agreement with CTRIP that we entered last year.
China is a material and faster when portion of our Asia-Pacific business, and we are leaning into that opportunity in a smart and responsible fashion. 
Rentalcars.com accelerated in Q4, comping a quarter last year and which should also accelerated. Rental car's excellent [ph] 2014 from position of strength and have seen this momentum continuing to 2015.
Kayak delivered an outstanding first full year as part of the group, delivering strong top line results of bottom line results significantly exceeded our expectations at the time of acquisition. Kayak has heads down innovating to extend its product leadership and build its brand in Europe. Early signs in Kayak in 2015 are so far quite positive.
OpenTable, our newest member to the group, remains very busy laying the groundwork for its cloud-based re-platforming and international expansion. As I mentioned on the last call, our vision for OpenTable is to expansive, and 2015 will be a profitable investment. It will take time to staff and scale our European sales organization, and there's no shortage of product enhancements, internal plumbing improvement and infrastructure investments to make, so that OpenTable is best positioned to scale to its true global potential.
I will have more to share on OpenTable's progress as the year unfolds, but we are optimistic from everything we are seeing so far and our team is super motivated.
In the U.S., OpenTable continues to achieve high diner growth as it transitions it's restaurant base to its cloud-based offering, and continuous this role in Pay with OpenTable. 
Mobile remains a continued bright spot for all of our brands. Just this past week, Booking.com exceeded 100,000 gross transaction that's before cancellations or amendments on just mobile phones on 2 different dates, and we're still not in high season for booking.
On January 15, we also launched Booking Now on the Apple platform in the United States. Booking Now with our app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers. Our international launch of Booking Now, including the addition of all of our supported languages, will start in earnest next week.
priceline.com leads the group in the percentage of travel book is completed on mobile, on some days now approaching 50%. Kayak and OpenTable both have flourishing businesses on their apps, especially in the United States, which drives strong repeat traffic. 
From a very small part of our business, just a few years ago, mobile has become a mission-critical part of the group, both to deliver transactionsand to deliver great and then experiences for our guests.
Excellent execution in our mobile platform has been critical to the groups success's and overall market share gains this year.
The group performed well in 2014, exceeding expectations throughout the year and growing more in 1 year on an absolute basis than in any year in our history. As we enter 2015, we see continued strong momentum in our business across the board. Our biggest short-term challenge is currency. With over 90% of our business in our international brand, and a significant majority of that being transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, mostly, the euro and British pound, but also to a lesser effect, the Brazilian real, Australian Canadian dollars, Russian ruble, Thai baht and Turkish lira, this prevents -- prevents mostly a translation challenge.
Our fundamental growth momentum is measured by units constant currency remained strong, unlike some other companies who have reported, a currency tailwind especially, a transitional challenge and not a mismatch of revenue and expense.
We remain steadfast and committed to our formula of did have innovating the competition. We are in this game for the long run, making a smart and sustainable investments in our products and services everyday of the year. We invest in profitable growth and are earning our customers loyalty through superior customer offerings and branded experiences.
We believe we have a winning, sustainable strategy and have the growing mix of direct business all year, while delivering market-leading organic performance on both the top and bottom line. 
We also believe we can win with strong margins in the face of heated competition, and I have a long history of managing our costs extremely well and plan to continue our track record of strong leverage and margin management.
All that said, we are also not afraid to use our resources to invest assertively when investments make sense, because we believe it currently does in online demand channels and most recently, into our OpenTable and BookingSuite investments, in particular.
We looked at various options to use our capital in the current environment. Today, we're announcing that the Priceline board has given us the authority to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We believe this is a good use of capital, and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of the group.
It has been a privilege this year, past year as group CEO to lead a team of such talented and dedicated people at all the brands. There's no better job on the planet in my opinion. I'm enthusiastic about all of the opportunities facing each of our brands. I want to thank our employees around the world for delivering another terrific year for their brands and for the group.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Q4 was a strong quarter from both the top and bottom line perspective. Unit growth is an important metric to focus on for our business to understand core performance, excluding the impact of currency.
Room nights both grew by 24% in the fourth quarter, decelerating modestly compared to the 27% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 16% in Q4, reflecting accelerating retail growth, offset by a decrease for 4 Name Your Own Price rental car reservations. Strong momentum in room nights and rental car day unit growth is carried over into Q1, as we will see in a moment when we review Q1 guidance.
Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4 2014, were up on a local currency basis by about 1.5% for the consolidated group. Q4 gross bookings grew by about 23% on a local currency basis and by about 17% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year.
Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by about 27% on a local currency basis and by about 19% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 3%. The Priceline team is doing a great job in improving the experience for our customers on the website, which is driving nice conversion improvements.  The results has been accelerating retail room night and rental car growth. 
However, in Name Your Own Price services, continued to be hamstrung by lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 33% on a constant currency basis and by 26% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion, which grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis, and by 24% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $241 million, which represented 35% growth versus prior year.
OpenTable generated total worldwide revenue in Q4 of about $59 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.4% of gross profit for Q4, which is 132 bps lower than last year. Our operating margins were flat investments we made in off-line advertising and other OpEx to build our brands and support growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services.
Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to a less than forecasted year-over-year decline in online advertising ROIs.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $712 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $665 million, and represents 23% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 22%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $755 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter 2014, which is about 36% above last year. We invested $41 million on CapEx and repurchased 443,000 shares of our common stock for $505 million in Q4. 
As Darren mentioned, earlier this month, our board authorized us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute the program going forward to return capital to shareholders, and if they that we think may cents relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $8 billion at year-end, with about $1.2 billion of that balance in the U.S. We were pleased to recently receive a strong investment-grade credit rating from Moody's, which is in line with our current rating from S&P. This positions us well as we continue to monitor the debt markets in the U.S. and Europe for opportunities to raise capital at attractive rates.
For full year 2014, Priceline Group grew room nights in gross bookings by 28%. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to about $3.5 billion, and grew 29%, while the business generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations. The company delivered an operating margin expressed as non-GAAP operating income divided by gross profit, about 44.7%. 
I thank our people around the world for their hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results. Their talent and relentless execution to add properties, rental car suppliers and restaurants, continuously innovate on our websites and apps and efficiently bringing new customers to our brands with online and off-line advertising, is responsible for our success.
I am also pleased with the balance of outstanding top line and bottom line growth in an ultra-competitive market. Now for Q1 guidance. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. As Darren mentioned, about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income for 2014 are generated by our international brands. Therefore, as we've seen in the past, during the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, extreme volatility in foreign exchange rates significantly impacts our operating results as we translate them into U.S. dollars.
Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the quarter are equal to yesterday's closing rates. At these exchange rates, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've them last year's for exchange rates for Q1 and the remainder of the year.
Specifically, our forecast for 2 over most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, assumes rates remain at $1.14 per euro and $1.54 for British pound, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 17% for the euro and about 8% for the British pound for Q1 as compared to the prior year.
I highlight that the $1.14 exchange rate assumed in our forecast is about 9% weaker than the $1.25 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we the reported Q3 and most analysts last updated their forecasts.
On the positive side, our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on the basis similar to our revenues, so our expenses will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact.
However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact, somewhat less pronounced in Q1 and slightly more pronounced in Q3. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in the resilient unit growth driving our forecasted total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis.
We believe the true performances of our business will eventually show through in our U.S. dollar financial statements when the dollar stabilizes relative to other currencies in general, and the euro, in particular. We are pleased with the high growth rates the business has consistently delivered over the past several years despite its size. The travel market remains fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly, and in Europe. Our guidance reflects a strong start to the first quarter, and our assumption that are growth rates will decelerate as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter due to the size of our business.
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant currency basis and by 2% to 9% in U.S. dollars, with the U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis, and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by slightly less than 1% compared to the prior-year period.
We expect the Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 4% to 11%, and gross profits grow by 21% to 28% on a local currency basis, and by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q1.
We expect about 550 bps of de-leverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, driven mainly by nonadvertising operating expenses. 
As we have done in the past, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Our Q1 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to date, and assumes increased pressure on ad efficiency throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we have experienced over the last couple of years. 
Investments and OpEx and advertising, typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1, where we are in a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality for our business.  While we are not giving earnings guidance beyond Q1, we do expect the pressure on operating margins from nonadvertising OpEx to significantly diminish as we proceed throughout the year and lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $475 million and $510 million, which at the midpoint, is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes and Alternative Minimum Tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.7 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price. We've forecast GAAP EPS between $5.25 and $5.80 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, which contracts in place to successfully shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from many further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income, do not hedge as against much of fluctuations and other recurrencies, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter.
Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general, and in our key European markets, in particular, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions."

First of all, as it relates to what as Travelocity, the pending deal with Orbitz, it's Expedia I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it sounds like a con",707,"Okay, Justin. Thanks. This is Darren. I'll guess, I'll take both questions. First of all, as it relates to what as Travelocity, the pending deal with Orbitz, it's Expedia I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it sounds like a consolidation strategy. Our focus as a group is quite different than that. We're very focused primarily on organic growth and execution. And from an activation standpoint, we're focused buying in premium, winning brands that either add new geographies or business verticals, or competencies, new channels that we can add to our existing brands. So if you look at our history as a group, whether it was buying Booking.com to compete in Europe, in Asia, rental cars and rental cars, Kayak and Meadow, OpenTable and restaurants, and then recently Buuteeq, to help build our BookingSuite business. It's all been adjacent growth versus doubling or tripling down on similar brands. I don't view -- I don't see the deal that Expedia has made. If it passes, it's being a negative for our group. I think if anything that consolidates, clarifies competition, and there's still plenty of room to grow. If you think travel market was a $1 trillion market, recently someone said it was a $1.3 trillion market, so if you add but all of our business and Expedia's business together, it's still less than 10% of the total opportunity space. And if you look at the U.S. specifically, for us, it's all upside, and we plan to work very hard to continue to increase our share in the U.S. market. So to me, it just shows that there's just tremendous potential ahead, and we're just staying very focused on what we do well, and I'm sure Expedia will do the same. So I don't see that overall, it's a negative. In terms of Expedia's growth rates, we have obviously always prided ourselves in being very highly profitable and continuing to grow very fast. I'm super proud of the 28% growth on top and bottom line that we've printed in 2014. It's always good to remind you that -- when we talk about our room nights, they're all 100% organic, and that's just a very different result, the way you're seeing at Expedia. But I do get them a lot of credit, they seem to have a great quarter, but we just have a different philosophy as it relates to building business for the long term. And then, mobile, specifically. Yes, mobile is -- I've been here now 3.5 years and it's by far, is the biggest thing that's changed in our business, and it's causing all sorts of issues and questions in terms of how do you generate demand, how do you build experiences. But as I've always said, for an e-commerce player like us, mobile is a net-net positive. It's allowing us to serve customers over multiple screens, and whether they arrive first on a phone or a tablet or a PC, it's not important to us, it's how do we basically become relevant to them, other than just being a transaction. How does OpenTable or Booking or Agoda create more relevant CME and then experience that they're having on a local basis? True enough, we do spend money on buying business that originates on mobile phones, and that market is still -- it's still not the most perfect market, it's still quite chaotic. But we've felt we've gotten a lot smarter about how we buy our business. Some brands are very app driven, if you look at OpenTable or Kayak, other brands are very mobile web driven, and then brands like Booking have a little bit of both. And we feel if anything, our -- the skills that we've built on the desktop, we're feeling as good, if not better, about the skills that we're applying in the mobile environment to buying new demand. And I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree -- because we have a common ROI standard, i don't think the increase in mobile to any degree has driven us to any lower standards. If anything, the one real positive, it's driving more of our business direct to our brands versus having to buy it."

Okay, Doug, I'll take -- this is Darren again, and I'll take those. So first of all, let me talk, first of all, OpenTable. Since we bought it, we've made a massive investment in reply forming the OpenTable B2B software, it's now going to be all cloud-based. The whole front end has been re-platformed so we can run AD experimentation on it. There's been a lot of best practice sharing. You're going to see the OpenTable product now improve at a very dramatic pace, because we put it onto the new modern cloud-based platform. We've also now posted our position that are beginning hiring for a number of international cities. I'd let you do your own research there, in terms of which cities we're expanding into. So I would say it's time today has been a lot of best practice sharing, getting some of the plumbing done in 2015, for us is a big expense investment here for OpenTable. And as we've always said, we're doing here to create something that is going to be truly a global platform and a modern e-commerce platform, and we're -- we remain very bullish on the opportunity with that asset. And certainly, today, has been performing abovev the level that we had expected it to. But really, the best is yet to come. And when it relates to BookingSuite, we bought Buuteeq and a smaller company called Hotel Ninjas. That team now has been completely brought into Booking.com, we've rebranded at BookingSuite. We're now in the market with a number of products, mostly website products. The demand of those products is very strong. And we're just now in the rhythm of really trying to scale the old Buuteeq business now that's fully integrated with Booking. And the receptivity from the market has been very strong. So what we're doing there is building out our SaaS-based business, but it takes a little bit of time to get going, but it's a really nice annuity revenue stream. But almost as importantly, it's bringing us closer to our hotel partners and showing that as a company, we can add value to them as well as a marketing services Software provider. And then finally, with CTRIP, there, I'd say that the biggest highlight has been significantly growing outbound business, both for Agoda and Booking.com on CTRIP. That reflects, of course, a very strong Chinese market. We've also seen our non-CTRIP business, by the way, growing very strong. So CTRIP now is a branded experience, so customers are learning about Booking.com and Agoda, and that's obviously very valuable to us. The other side of the CTRIP deal was getting see CTRIP hotels onto the Booking.com website. We now have from that's called hotels on our website. It's taken a little bit longer because we've had to work to make those hotels -- and to upgrade the products so that it was at the level of the products that we have in our website otherwise, but we're getting good traction there and we look in the coming quarters to significantly, accelerate our rollout of CTRIP properties in China. I'd mention this before but what of our biggest challenges in China, is most business in Chinese hotels is domestic. And we're really are very strong on inbound and outbound, and the CTRIP product portfolio is going to allow us to offset a very competitive selection of properties for domestic Chinese guests as well. So those are the 3 -- CTRIP in particular, you've all followed it, they've -- they're in a super competitive environment. We're really supportive of James and his team, we think they have the strongest hand in the market, and we still believe that today and we're proud of the deal we have. And we're working really closely with them as they try it competitive battles that they're fighting, which is largely been a domestic Chinese challenge."

But I guess, just big picture, how do you view Airbnb competitively in the hotel space longer term? And then a quick follow-up to the earlier question on mobile unit economics. I guess, I'll ask this a different way, but as you guys move away from paid searches and marketing channel, do you see the online marketing as a percent of gross profit, staying in this kind of 31% range or could that get better one day? That's all."

Yes, with respect to Airbnb, we have a lot of respect to what they're doing. It's -- it is still as good as their website, it's still a relatively high friction process of booking at Airbnb. But the whole sharing economy, peer-to-peer is a real force. I'll remind people that on average, everyday, we have more than 1 million guess, if you do the math. And if you look at the total number of units that are actually bookable on Booking.com, it far exceeds what's available on Airbnb. The interesting dynamic is really happening in the vacation rentals space. We're coming into the end of the market with an instantly bookable, immediately confirmable product. They're coming from the bottom-up with the sharing economy. And there is a lot of interest among our consumers in self catered products. And whether that's product ultimately ends up being somebody's sofa or being in a aparthotel room in Paris, nobody knows. But one of the things that Airbnb is really helping us with is the rules in this space, are traditionally been very foggy and gray. And city by city around the world, the rules are now getting written and that helps us a, lot because we're always going to play on the white side of the rules. But there've always been a little bit foggy, and we'll see where that all goes at the end of the day. There seems some -- we don't see a big impact on hotel demand based on this new Adventa, what I would call self-catered demand, and that's all up Airbnb, us, other players. But maybe, one day, you'll see that shift. And obviously, the big hotel brands, I don't think they're sitting still either. We see a lot of properties, for instance, in Europe, they have a hotel and they have an apartment block, and behind the hotel, you use a hotel front desk. But then as a family, you might stay in the apartment, and that's -- that kind of new behavior is a reaction, I think, to some of this current trend, at least. And then as it relates to mobile unit economics, I should also qualify that mobile web search is primarily still, a Google business. And it is working better and better. So when we -- even when we acquire a customer on the phone, one of the best ways to do it is through Google and through their web search. But as I look forward, what we've generally done this is become more direct, we're leaning even heavier into some of these channels. We've certainly keep ROI standards, but I can't particularly say, if long, long term online will be a lesser percentage -- but we will continue to adjust our marketing mix and we think that our margin level that, we need to keep throwing out the fishing net to find more and more customers, and we're not satisfied just to work out the loyalty of our existing customer base. So a lot of it depends on the opportunity to cast the fishing net in an ROI positive fashion. And it's hard to really predict that based on the competitive dynamics of some of these markets. But certainly, what you're seeing -- the one thing that is really, is we're having adjust our marketing mix over time based on mobile specifically, but also based on the ability of the -- let's call it the non-Google participants to create products that are ROI positive for us. And we are seeing targets in places like Facebook, for instance, and others where they're improving the ability for directors response performance marketers, like The Priceline Group to buy their product demand, that's a real good thing for us, because it hadn't been that case traditionally over the past."

So we don't have any new numbers on Vacation Rentals, we gave a trailing 12 months, but I will say, is the Vacation Rental business is growing our business. And so the next time we say a number, maybe we'll do it a year -- from the first time we said the number, you can think about it in that way. So it's becoming a greater proportion of our business. I always -- I also fly so you've got to be careful of property count, that's why we added the Vacation Rental sub-number, because it -- those properties do come in with less units than our traditional hotels. And that's why you will see our property count continued to expand the rate faster than our overall business because we're bringing on less units per property. And I think that'll continue to be the case going forward. I'd say that and I don't -- and we're not, by any means, done with acquisitions. There's a lot more to do -- and the next move on Vacation Rentals is to really address the homeowner versus property managed vacation rental product, and we're underway to doing that. And in terms of acquisitions or opportunities space, number 1, I would say, we have lot to digest right now. And we're in, what I consider to be the most attractive spaces. And the addition of restaurants is just an amazing opportunity for the group. Air is a very low-margin business, and it's right with customer service concerns. And our play in air right now is a little piece at Priceline, but also of course, Kayak, which plays off of both OTAs and direct air. And even though air is not a very attractive business from an EBITDA perspective, it is an important part of travel and we want to make sure that whatever we do in air that we remain relevant in air. And certainly, with over 90 partnerships with airlines all around the world, including Ryanair and easyJet and KLM, et cetera, we play an important partnership of how do you monetize air into things like hotel bookings. But as I look forward, yes, attractions are interesting. We're doing a lot of experimentation right now with various elements across. Always we're looking at things that yes, we can make money off, but much more importantly, what are the things that we can cross-sell that improves the spirits with the consumer and enhances their loyalty. So if you follow Booking right now, for instance, you'll see us do a lot of preaching of emails, and you'll see us now, we have insider guides to the top cities in the world. And within those guides, you'll see us testing and experimenting with various things. But again, we're not going to become the tchotchke shop itself 50 different things, to just make a little bit more money. We're really cognizant of what does the user really want us to do. And if any of those things gets big traction, then we'll figure out, how do we -- should we enter the space organically through acquisition or some -- or an alliance or some other mode, is a way to think about it. But at this specific moment, yes, we have -- we got our hands full and we are by and large, focused on organic execution."

And I think of the much bigger opportunity is cross promotion. Meaning, a, ""I live in Italy and I love using Booking.com, and oh, you can also do that with restaurants."" And that's the part that we've seen the biggest interest. When we look at our insider guidance and our reach up e-mails, the biggest thing people are interested in who book accommodations is restaurants. The restaurants nearby, where they booked. And the ability on that first night, if they're arriving late, where can I eat? Many of our hotels have restaurants, and has a competitive thing within the space, with the person who's sitting in there and now we're absolutely confident that there's significant interest on that. But we need to then get, of course, if great relevant content, get the OpenTable reviews, the photos, et cetera, and really lay those 2 things together. But we're quite optimistic. I'd say all of that in OpenTable proposition, it's not going to grow as a primary just because of Booking.com. OpenTable will need to stand on its own as a business, which it has in the United States, and I'm confident will internationally. Booking.com will be a nice new group of tens of millions of customers that we can introduce the concept to. And that's what -- that's really, the way I think about it versus get a hotel booking, get a restaurant booking. Although, by the way, we've tested that, it works, but it's not like the biggest idea in terms of the synergy between the brands."

They don't have a formal 4 and quote loyalty program, significant increases in those kind of metrics every single year that we've been in business. So that's what we focus on. Now the other question, though, is for high-volume travel, what do you do? And most of our business is built off of leisure travelers who don't actually book that often. But for high-volume travel, it seems like loyalty is an aspect. By the way, it's a very deep aspect more in the United States than it is in many other parts of the world, where people take a lot more leisure travel versus pure business travel. So we've always been interested in, what is the role of points and loyalty programs, what role should the group play in that. By the way, some of these programs, you think they drive them to be more layout, but they can actually make some more dissatisfied with you, because people will give you points and then make it harder and harder for you to use your points, that's what marketers do. And CFOs do it, Tony, as well, looking at Dan. so there's always a caution with these things. But we're obviously very interested in it. It hasn't been a big issue for us in the past. So when you do like a specific pockets of high-volume traveler, that's where probably we have the greatest going forward interest in this topic."

I think another thing I would add to your list, if any chase, is things like Booking Now, they basically like -- not to go to Paris to London or New York, they just to wander off into the countryside. Many of them don't have computers, they only have phones. So it's -- thinking all of all those things and as well as other products on the site. We're one of the risk leaders in hostels. If you go to any hostel in Europe, a lot of people are using Booking.com to book hospitals. So making sure that we're relevant to this next generation of travelers, is also helping us make sure we're relevant with the emerging lifestyle of the consumers. And so we do a lot of work not -- I wouldn't say, traditional marketing work, like we're not buying ads on just programs that millennials watch, that's never been something we do. But we target them more from a data perspective, and also making sure that the product that we have is relevant for their lifestyles. And the least the data that we see shows that we have a very large group of young people who use Booking.com on a regular basis, even backpacking through Europe, we're a relevant thing. We're not just a rich person's product, that obviously keeps the brand healthy. And we hope that the hostels payers become hotel bookers, et cetera, through their lifecycle. But it's a good question and certainly, watching my own children -- the world is changing very, very fast, and we want to make sure we relevant the way that they use their screens versus the way that, Dan and I would use our screens, which is quite different."

Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $10.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year or about 23% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.85, up 23% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $10.10 per share and our guidance for the quarter. For the full year, The Priceline Group reported gross bookings of just over $50 billion, $346 million room nights, $3.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share of $53.31, all up about 28% year-over-year.
Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com, which now has over 600,000 hotels and other accommodations in 212 countries and territories, up 41% over last year. Booking.com continues to invest aggressively in its global supply platform, building substantially differentiated hotel and accommodation supply, content and availability. Much of that growth in supply is driven by vacation rentals, which more than doubled to 247,000 properties, including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products, all of which are instantly confirmable. It is important to note that because many of our vacation rental properties have multiple units, our 247,000 properties actually represent over 1 million instantly bookable and confirmable units within these properties. We continue to believe in the large untapped potential of the global vacation rental opportunity, which has historically been burdened by a high friction research and fulfillment process. 
In addition to aggressively growing our number of accommodation partners, the group invested nearly $2.6 billion in marketing during the year. While the preponderance of that investment was in online channels, Booking.com continued to build its offline competencies. Following successful TV launches in the U.S. and Australia in 2013, we also ran effective campaigns in the U.K., Canada and Germany. We are pleased with the return on total advertising we are seeing in these markets, and we'll continue to explore new markets, where the data tells us it makes sense to diversify our ad spend.
2014 was a tale of 2 cities for priceline.com with solid growth in its retail businesses offset by declines in its opaque businesses. We believe the pressure in opaque is reflective of a historically healthy overall travel environment in the United States, which is beneficial to the balance of our group-wide business.
The fast-growing Asia-Pacific market was another critical component to the group's success in 2014. We believe Agoda.com and Booking.com lead the region in intra-Asian hotel and accommodation bookings. And we're now harvesting the fruit of our new commercial agreement with Ctrip that we entered last year. China is a material and fast-growing portion of our Asia Pacific business, and we are leaning into that opportunity in a smart and responsible fashion. 
Rentalcars.com accelerated in Q4, comping a quarter last year in which it had also accelerated. Rentalcar has exited 2014 from a position of strength and have seen its momentum continue into 2015. KAYAK delivered an outstanding first full year as part of the group, delivering strong top line results and bottom line results have significantly exceeded our expectations at the time of acquisition. KAYAK is hands down innovating to extend its product leadership and build its brand in Europe. Early signs for KAYAK in 2015 are so far quite positive.
OpenTable, our newest member to the group, remains very busy laying the groundwork for its cloud-based replatforming and international expansion. As I mentioned on the last call, our vision for OpenTable is expansive. And 2015 will be a year of profitable investment. It will take time to staff and scale our European sales organization. And there is no shortage of product enhancements, internal plumbing improvements and infrastructure investments to make so that OpenTable is best-positioned to scale to its true global potential. I will have more to share on OpenTable's progress as the year unfolds, but we are optimistic from everything we are seeing so far, and our team is super motivated. In the U.S., OpenTable continues to achieve high diner growth as it transitions its restaurant base to its cloud-based offering and continues its rollout of Pay with OpenTable. 
Mobile remains a continued bright spot for all of our brands. Just this past week, Booking.com exceeded 100,000 gross transactions, that's before cancellations or amendments, on just mobile phones on 2 different days. And we are still not in high season for bookings. On January 15, we also launched Booking Now on the Apple platform in the United States. Booking Now is our app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers. Our international launch of Booking Now, including the addition of all of our supported languages, will start in earnest next week.
Priceline.com leads the group in the percentage of travel bookings completed on mobile, on some days now approaching 50%. KAYAK and OpenTable both have flourishing businesses on their apps, especially in the United States, which drives strong repeat traffic. From a very small part of our business, just a few years ago, mobile has become a mission-critical part of the group, both to deliver transactions and to deliver great end-to-end experiences for our guests. Excellent execution in our mobile platforms has been critical to the group's success and overall market share gains this year.
The group performed well in 2014, exceeding expectations throughout the year and growing more in 1 year on an absolute basis than in any year in our history. As we enter 2015, we see continued strong momentum in our business across the board. Our biggest short-term challenge is currency. With over 90% of our business in our international brands and a significant majority of that being transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, mostly the euro and British pound but also to a lesser effect, the Brazilian real, Australian, Canadian dollars, Russian ruble, Thai baht and Turkish lira, this presents mostly a translation challenge. Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units on constant currency remained strong. Unlike some other companies who have reported, our currency challenge again is largely a translational challenge and not a mismatch of revenue and expenses.
We remain steadfast and committed to our formula of out-executing and out-innovating the competition. We are in this game for the long run, making the smart and sustainable investments in our products and services every day of the year. We invest in profitable growth and are earning our customers' loyalty through superior customer offerings and branded experiences. We believe we have a winning, sustainable strategy and have observed a growing mix of direct business all year while delivering market-leading organic performance on both the top and bottom line. We also believe we can win with strong margins in the face of heated competition and have a long history of managing our costs extremely well and plan to continue our track record of strong leverage and margin management. All that said, we are also not afraid to use our resources to invest assertively when investments make sense because we believe it currently does in online demand channels and most recently, into our OpenTable and BookingSuite investments, in particular.
We looked at various options to use our capital in the current environment. Today, we are announcing that the Priceline board has given us the authority to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We believe this is a good use of capital and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of the group. It has been a privilege this year -- past year as group CEO to lead a team of such talented and dedicated people at all the brands. There's no better job on the planet in my opinion. I'm enthusiastic about all of the opportunities facing each of our brands. I want to thank our employees around the world for delivering another terrific year for their brands and for the group.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Q4 was a strong quarter from both a top and bottom line perspective. Unit growth is an important metric to focus on for our business to understand core performance, excluding the impact of currency.
Room nights booked grew by 24% in the fourth quarter, decelerating modestly compared to 27% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 16% in Q4, reflecting accelerating retail growth, offset by a decrease for Name Your Own Price rental car reservations. Strong momentum in room night and rental car day unit growth has carried over into Q1 as we will see in a moment when we review Q1 guidance. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 1.5% for the consolidated group. Q4 gross bookings grew by about 23% on a local currency basis and by about 17% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year.
Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by about 27% on a local currency basis and by about 19% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 3%. The Priceline team is doing a great job improving the experience for customers on the website, which is driving nice conversion improvements. The results has been accelerating retail room nights and rental car growth. However, Name Your Own Price services, continued to be hamstrung by lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 33% on a constant currency basis and by 26% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion, which grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 24% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $241 million, which represented 35% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated total worldwide revenue in Q4 of about $59 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.4% of gross profit for Q4, which is 132 bps lower than last year. Our operating margins reflect investments we made in offline advertising and other OpEx to build our brands and support growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to a less-than-forecasted year-over-year decline in online advertising ROIs.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $712 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $665 million and represents 23% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 22% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $755 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2014, which was about 36% above last year. We invested $41 million on CapEx and repurchased 443,000 shares of our common stock for $505 million in Q4. As Darren mentioned, earlier this month, our board authorized us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute the program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $8 billion at year end with about $1.2 billion of that balance in the U.S. We were pleased to recently receive a strong investment-grade credit rating from Moody's, which is in line with our current rating from S&P. This positions us well as we continue to monitor the debt markets in the U.S. and Europe for opportunities to raise capital at attractive rates. For full year 2014, Priceline Group grew room nights and gross bookings by 28%. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to about $3.5 billion and grew 29% while the business generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations. The company delivered an operating margin, expressed as non-GAAP operating income divided by gross profit, of 44.7%. 
I thank our people around the world for their hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results. Their talent and relentless execution to add properties, rental car suppliers and restaurants, continuously innovate on our websites and apps and efficiently bringing new customers to our brands with online and offline advertising is responsible for our success. I am also pleased with the balance of outstanding top line and bottom line growth in an ultra-competitive market. 
Now for Q1 guidance. I'd like to take a moment to talk about the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. As Darren mentioned, about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income for 2014 are generated by our international brands. Therefore, as we've seen in the past during the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, extreme volatility in foreign exchange rates significantly impacts our operating results as we translate them into U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the quarter are equal to yesterday's closing rates. At these exchange rates, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1 and the remainder of the year.
Specifically, our forecast for 2 of our most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, assumes rates remain at $1.14 per euro and $1.54 for British pound, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 17% for the euro and about 8% for the British pound for Q1 as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the $1.14 euro exchange rate assumed in our forecast is about 9% weaker than the $1.25 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q3 and most analysts last updated their forecasts. On the positive side, our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, so our expenses will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact.
However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 and slightly more pronounced in Q3. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in the resilient unit growth driving our forecasted total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis. We believe the true performance of our business will eventually show through in our U.S. dollar financial statements, when the dollar stabilizes relative to other currencies in general and the euro in particular. We are pleased with the high growth rates the business has consistently delivered over the past several years despite its size. The travel market remains fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our guidance reflects a strong start to the first quarter, and our assumption that are growth rates will decelerate as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter due to the size of our business.
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant currency basis and by 2% to 9% in U.S. dollars with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by slightly less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect the Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 4% to 11% and gross profit to grow by 21% to 28% on a local currency basis and by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars. We expect that the declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q1. We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, driven mainly by nonadvertising operating expenses. 
As we have done in the past, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Our Q1 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to date and assumes increased pressure on ad efficiency throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we have experienced over the last couple of years. Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1, where we are in a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality for our business. While we are not giving earnings guidance beyond Q1, we do expect the pressure on operating margins from nonadvertising OpEx to significantly diminish as we proceed throughout the year and lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $475 million and $510 million, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.7 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $5.25 and $5.80 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact in translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income; do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies; and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter. Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general and in our key European markets in particular, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions."

Certainly, Russian outbound is down for obvious reasons, although Russian domestic travel is still quite strong. France, specifically, is still in a bit of a malaise both as a destination and as bookers. But that's made up for the fact that the Brits as bookers are very strong, the German as bookers are strong. And Southern Europe, it looks like it's going to be very popular at the spring and summer. So overall, Europe is not -- the U.S. is definitely one of the hottest markets in the world, but Europe is holding up quite well, at least the early signs in 2015."

First of all, as it relates to what if Travelocity has a pending deal with Orbitz -- it's hard, I'm not Expedia, so I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it",715,"Okay, Justin. Thanks. This is Darren. I guess I'll take both questions. First of all, as it relates to what if Travelocity has a pending deal with Orbitz -- it's hard, I'm not Expedia, so I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it just sounds like a consolidation strategy. Our focus as a group is quite different than that. We're very focused primarily on organic growth and execution. And from an activation standpoint, we're focused buying premium, winning brands that either add new geographies or business verticals or competencies, new channels that we can add to our existing brands. So if you look at our history as a group, whether it was buying Booking.com to compete in Europe, Agoda in Asia, rentalcars in rental cars, KAYAK in meta, OpenTable in restaurants, and then recently Buuteeq to help build our BookingSuite business. It's all been adjacent growth versus doubling and tripling down on similar brands. I don't -- my own view is I don't see the deal that Expedia has made, if it passes, as being a negative for our group. I think if anything, it consolidates and clarifies competition. And there's still plenty of room to grow. If you think travel market was a $1 trillion market, recently someone said it was a $1.3 trillion market. So if you add both all of our business and Expedia's business together, it's still less than 10% of the total opportunity space. And if you look at the U.S. specifically, for us, it's all upside. And we plan to work very hard to continue to increase our share in the U.S. market. So to me, it just shows that there's just tremendous potential ahead and we're just staying very focused on what we do well. And I'm sure Expedia will do the same. So I don't see that overall, it's a negative. In terms of Expedia's growth rates, well, we've always prided ourselves in being very highly profitable and continuing to grow very fast. I'm super proud of the 28% growth on top and bottom line that we've printed in 2014. It's always good to remind you that when we talk about our room nights, they're all 100% organic. And that's just a very different result from the way you're seeing with Expedia. But I do give them a lot of credit, they seem to have printed a great quarter, but we just have a different philosophy as it relates to building business for the long term. And then mobile specifically. Yes, mobile is -- I've been here now 3.5 years and it's, by far, the biggest thing that's changed in our business. And it's causing all sorts of issues and questions in terms of how do you generate demand, how do you build experiences. But as I've always said, for an e-commerce player like us, mobile is a net-net positive. It's allowing us to serve customers over multiple screens. And whether they arrive first on a phone or a tablet or a PC, it's not important to us, it's how do we basically become relevant to them other than just being a transaction. How does OpenTable or Booking or Agoda create more relevancy in the end-to-end experience that they're having on a local basis? True enough, we do spend money on buying business that originates on mobile phones. And that market is still -- it's still not the most perfect market, it's still quite chaotic. But we've felt we've gotten a lot smarter about how we buy our business. Some brands are very app-driven, if you look at OpenTable or KAYAK. Other brands are very mobile Web-driven. And then brands like Booking have a little bit of both. And we feel, if anything, our -- the skills that we've built on the desktop, we're feeling as good, if not better, about the skills that we're applying in the mobile environment to buying new demand. And I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree -- because we have a common ROI standard, I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree has driven us to any lower standards. If anything, the one real positive is it's driving more of our business direct to our brands versus having to buy it."

Since we bought it, we've made a massive investment in replatforming the OpenTable B2B software. It's now going to be all cloud-based. The whole front end has been replatformed, so we can run A/B experimentation on it. There's been a lot of best practice sharing. You're going to see the OpenTable product now improve at a very dramatic pace because we've put it on to this new, modern, cloud-based platform. We've also now posted our position that are beginning hiring for a number of international cities. I'll let you do your own research there in terms of which cities we're expanding into. So I would say it's time to date has been a lot of best practice sharing, getting some of the plumbing done and 2015 for us is a big investment year for OpenTable. And as we've always said, we're going here to create something that is going to be truly a global platform and a modern e-commerce platform, and we're -- we remain very bullish on the opportunity with that asset. And certainly, today, it has been performing above the levels that we had expected it to. But really the best is yet to come. And when it relates to BookingSuite, we bought Buuteeq and a smaller company called Hotel Ninjas. That team now has been completely brought into Booking.com. We've rebranded it as BookingSuite. We're now in the market with a number of products, mostly website products. The demand of those products is very strong. And we're just now in the rhythm of really trying to scale the old Buuteeq business now that's fully integrated with Booking. And the receptivity from the market has been very strong. So what we're doing there is building out a SaaS-based business. It takes a little bit of time to get going, but it has a really nice annuity revenue stream. But almost as importantly, it's bringing us closer to our hotel partners and showing that as a company, we can add value to them as well as a marketing services software provider. And then finally, with Ctrip, there, I'd say that the biggest highlight has been a significantly growing outbound business both with Agoda and Booking.com on Ctrip. That reflects, of course, a very strong Chinese market. We've also seen our non-Ctrip business, by the way, growing very strong. So Ctrip now is a branded experience. So customers are learning about Booking.com and Agoda. And that's obviously very valuable to us. The other side of the Ctrip deal was getting Ctrip hotels on to the Booking.com website. We now have, let's call it, a few handfuls of their hotels on our website. It's taken a little bit longer because we've had work to make those hotels and upgrade the product so that it's at the level of the products that we have in our website otherwise. But we're getting good traction there and we look in the coming quarters to significantly accelerate our rollout of Ctrip properties in China. I'd mention this before, but one of our biggest challenges in China is most business of Chinese hotels is domestic. And we really are very strong on inbound and outbound. And the Ctrip product portfolio is going to allow us to offer a very competitive selection of properties for domestic Chinese guests as well. So those are the 3 -- Ctrip, in particular, you've all followed it. They've -- they're in a super competitive environment. We're really supportive of James and his team. We think they have the strongest hand in the market. And we still believe that today and we're proud of the deal we have. And we're working really closely with them as they fight the competitive battles that they're fighting, which has largely been a domestic Chinese challenge."

I guess, I'll ask this a different way. But as you guys move away from paid searches and marketing channel, do you see the online marketing, as a percent of gross profit, staying in this kind of 31% range? Or could that get better 1 day?

Yes, with respect to Airbnb, we have a lot of respect for what they're doing. It is still -- as good as their website is, it's still a relatively high-friction process of booking on Airbnb. But the whole sharing economy peer-to-peer is a real force. I'll remind people that on average every day, we have more than 1 million guests, if you do the math. And if you look at the total number of units that are actually bookable on Booking.com, it far exceeds what's available on Airbnb. The interesting dynamic is really happening in the vacation rental space. We're coming into the market with an instantly bookable, immediately confirmable product. They're coming from the bottom-up with the sharing economy. And there is a lot of interest among our consumers in self-catered products. And whether that product ultimately ends up being somebody's sofa or being an aparthotel room in Paris, nobody knows. But one of the things that Airbnb is really helping us with is the rules in this space, tradition has been very foggy and gray. And city-by-city around the world, the rules are now getting written, and that helps us a lot because we're always going to play on the white side of the rules. But they've always been a little bit foggy. And we'll see where that all goes at the end of the day. There seems  -- we don't see a big impact on hotel demand based on this new advent of what I would call self-catered demand. And that's all up, Airbnb, us, other players. But maybe 1 day, you'll see that shift. And obviously, the big hotel brands, I don't think they're sitting still either. We see a lot of properties, for instance, in Europe, who have the hotel, and then they have an apartment block behind the hotel. You use the hotel front desk, but then as a family, you might stay in the apartment, and that's -- that kind of new behavior is a reaction, I think, to some of this current trend at least. And then as it relates to mobile unit economics, I should also qualify that mobile Web search is primarily still a Google business. And it is working better and better. So when we -- even when we acquire a customer on the phone, one of the best ways to do it is through Google and through their Web search. But as I look forward, what we have generally done as our business has become more direct, we're leaning even heavier into some of these channels. We certainly keep ROI standards, but I can't particularly say, if long, long term online will be a lesser percentage. But we will continue to adjust our marketing mix. And we think at our margin level that we need to keep throwing out the fishing net to find more and more customers. And we're not satisfied just to work out the loyalty of our existing customer base. So a lot of it depends on the opportunity to cast the fishing net in an ROI-positive fashion. And it's hard to really predict that based on the competitive dynamics of some of these markets. But certainly, what you're seeing, the one thing that is real is we're having to adjust our marketing mix over time based on mobile specifically but also based on the ability of, let's call it, the non-Google participants to create products that are ROI-positive for us. And we are seeing progress in places like Facebook, for instance, and others, where they're improving the ability for direct response performance marketers, like The Priceline Group, to buy their product. And that's a real good thing for us because it hadn't been that case traditionally in the past."

What I will say is the vacation rental business is outgrowing our business. And so the next time we say a number, maybe we'll do it a year from the first time we said the number, you can think about it in that way. So it's becoming a greater proportion of our business. I always I also [indiscernible], you've got to be careful of property count. That's why we added the vacation rental sub-number because those properties do come in with less units than our traditional hotels. And that's why you will see our property count continue to expand at a rate faster than our overall business because we're bringing on less units per property. And I think that will continue to be the case going forward. I say that and I don't -- and we're not, by any means, done with acquisitions. There's a lot more to do -- and the next move in vacation rentals is to really address the homeowner versus property managed vacation rental product. And we're well on our way to doing that. And in terms of acquisitions or opportunity space, number one, I would say, we have lot to digest right now. And we're in what I consider to be the most attractive spaces. And the addition of restaurants is just an amazing opportunity for the group. Air is a very low-margin business. And it's rife with customer service concerns. And our play in air right now is a little piece at Priceline. But also of course, KAYAK, which plays off of both OTAs and direct air. And even though air is not a very attractive business from an EBITDA perspective, it is an important part of travel. And we want to make sure that whatever we do in air, that we remain relevant in air. And certainly, with over 90 partnerships with airlines all around the world, including Ryanair and easyJet and KLM, et cetera, we play an important partnership of how do you monetize air into things like hotel bookings. But as I look forward, yes, attractions are interesting. We're doing a lot of experimentation right now with various elements across. So always, we're looking at things that, yes, we can make money off, but much more importantly, what are the things that we can cross-sell that improves the experience with the consumer and enhances their loyalty. So if you follow Booking right now, for instance, you'll see us do a lot of pretrip emails, and you'll see us now, we have the insider guides to the top cities in the world. And within those guides, you'll see us testing and experimenting the various things. But again we're not going to become the tchotchke shop that sell 50 different things to just make a little bit more money. We're really cognizant of what does the user really want us to do. And if any of those things gets big traction, then we'll figure out should we enter the space organically through acquisition or some -- or an alliance or some other mode is the way I think about it. But at this specific moment, yes, we've got our hands full and we're by and large, focused on organic execution."

Many of our hotels have restaurants, and that's a competitive thing within the space with the person who's sitting in there. And now we're absolutely confident that there's significant interest on that. What we need to then get, of course, is great relevant content, get the OpenTable reviews, the photos, et cetera, and really lace those 2 things together. But we're quite optimistic. I'd say all of that in OpenTable proposition is not going to grow as a primary just because of Booking.com. OpenTable will need to stand on its own as a business, which it has in the United States, and I'm confident, will internationally. Booking.com will be a nice new group of tens of millions of customers that we can introduce the concept to. And that's what -- that's really the way I think about it versus get a hotel booking, get a restaurant booking, although by the way, we've tested that, it works. But it's not like the biggest idea in terms of the synergy between the brands."

There are large -- very large domestic OTAs in the market, the Ctrips, the Jalans, the Rakutens, who do actually very high-volume business, but their business is largely domestic.

I guess, it's as much my philosophy as some of the brand CEOs. And I grew up at Starbucks and other places, where my own view and what we've seen in the data is that customers are most loyal when you give them a great experience. And that's what we've really been focused on. And it's driven -- if you look at repeat behavior, if you look at number of bookings and a share of wallet in a year, we've seen in our biggest brands that don't have a formal enclosed loyalty program significant increases in those kind of metrics every single year that we've been in business. So that's what we focus on. Now the other question though is for high-volume travel, what do you do? And most of our business is built off of leisure travelers, who don't actually book that often. But for high-volume travel, it seems like loyalty is an aspect. By the way, it's a very deep aspect more in the United States than it is in many other parts of the world, where people take a lot more leisure travel versus pure business travel. So we've always been interested in what is the role of points in loyalty programs, what role should the group play in that. By the way, some of these programs, you think they drive people to be more loyal, but they can actually make some more dissatisfied with you because people will give you points, and then make it harder and harder for you to use your points, that's what marketers do. And CFOs do it as well, I'm looking at Dan. So there's always caution with these things. But we're obviously very interested. It hasn't been a big issue for us in the past. But when you do look at specific pockets of high-volume travelers, that's where probably we have the greatest going-forward interest in this topic."

I think another thing I would add to your list, it's [indiscernible],  it's things like Booking Now, they basically like not to go to Paris or London or New York. They like to just wander off into the countryside. Many of them don't have computers, they only have phones. So it's thinking all of all those things and as well as having product on the site. We're one of the world leaders in hostels. If you go to any hostel in Europe, a lot of people are using Booking.com to book hostels. So making sure that we're relevant to this next generation of travelers is also helping us make sure we're relevant with the emerging lifestyle of the consumers. And so we do a lot of work, not -- I wouldn't say traditional marketing work, like we're not buying ads on just programs that millennials watch. That's never been something we do. But we target them more from a data perspective and also making sure that the product that we have is relevant to their lifestyles. And at least the data that we see shows that we have a very large group of young people who use Booking.com on a regular basis. Even backpacking through Europe, we're a relevant thing. We're not just a rich person's product. And that obviously keeps the brand healthy. And we hope that the hostel stayers become hotel bookers, et cetera, through their lifecycle. But it's a great question. And certainly, watching my own children, the world is changing very, very fast. And we want to make sure we're relevant to the way that they use their screens versus the way that Dan and I would use our screens, which is quite different."

Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here with Priceline Group CFO Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $10.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year or about 23% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.85, up 23% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $10.10 per share and our guidance for the quarter. For the full year, The Priceline Group reported gross bookings of just over $50 billion, 346 million room nights, $3.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share of $53.31, all up about 28% year-over-year.
Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com, which now has over 600,000 hotels and other accommodations in 212 countries and territories, up 41% over last year. Booking.com continues to invest aggressively in its global supply platform, building substantially differentiated hotel and accommodation supply, content and availability. Much of that growth in supply is driven by vacation rentals, which more than doubled to 247,000 properties, including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products, all of which are instantly confirmable. It is important to note that because many of our vacation rental properties have multiple units, our 247,000 properties actually represent over 1 million instantly bookable and confirmable units within these properties. We continue to believe in the large untapped potential of the global vacation rental opportunity, which has historically been burdened by a high-friction research and fulfillment process. 
In addition to aggressively growing our number of accommodation partners, the group invested nearly $2.6 billion in marketing during the year. While the preponderance of that investment was in online channels, Booking.com continued to build its offline competencies. Following successful TV launches in the U.S. and Australia in 2013, we also ran effective campaigns in the U.K., Canada and Germany. We are pleased with the return on total advertising we are seeing in these markets, and we'll continue to explore new markets where the data tells us it makes sense to diversify our ad spend.
2014 was a tale of 2 cities for priceline.com with solid growth in its retail businesses offset by declines in its opaque businesses. We believe the pressure in opaque is reflective of a historically healthy overall travel environment in the United States, which is beneficial to the balance of our group-wide business.
The fast-growing Asia-Pacific market was another critical component to the group's success in 2014. We believe Agoda.com and Booking.com lead the region in intra-Asian hotel and accommodation bookings. And we're now harvesting the fruit of our new commercial agreement with Ctrip that we entered last year. China is a material and fast-growing portion of our Asia Pacific business, and we are leaning into that opportunity in a smart and responsible fashion. 
Rentalcars.com accelerated in Q4, comping a quarter last year in which it also accelerated. Rentalcars exited 2014 from a position of strength and has seen its momentum continue into 2015. KAYAK delivered an outstanding first full year as part of the group, delivering strong top line results, and bottom line results significantly exceeded our expectations at the time of acquisition. KAYAK is heads down innovating to extend its product leadership and build its brand in Europe. Early signs for KAYAK in 2015 are so far quite positive.
OpenTable, our newest member to the group, remains very busy laying the groundwork for its cloud-based replatforming and international expansion. As I mentioned on the last call, our vision for OpenTable is expansive. And 2015 will be a year of profitable investment. It will take time to staff and scale a European sales organization. And there is no shortage of product enhancements, internal plumbing improvements and infrastructure investments to make so that OpenTable is best positioned to scale to its true global potential. I will have more to share on OpenTable's progress as the year unfolds, but we are optimistic from everything we are seeing so far, and our team is super motivated. In the U.S., OpenTable continues to achieve high diner growth as it transitions its restaurant base to its cloud-based offering and continues its rollout of Pay with OpenTable. 
Mobile remains a continued bright spot for all of our brands. Just this past week, Booking.com exceeded 100,000 gross transactions, that's before cancellations or amendments, on just mobile phones on 2 different days. And we are still not in high season for bookings. On January 15, we also launched Booking Now on the Apple platform in the United States. Booking Now is our app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers. Our international launch of Booking Now, including the addition of all of our supported languages, will start in earnest next week.
Priceline.com leads the group in the percentage of travel bookings completed on mobile, on some days now approaching 50%. KAYAK and OpenTable both have flourishing businesses on their apps, especially in the United States, which drives strong repeat traffic. From a very small part of our business just a few years ago, mobile has become a mission-critical part of the group, both to deliver transactions and to deliver great end-to-end experiences for our guests. Excellent execution on our mobile platforms has been critical to the group's success and overall market share gains this year.
The group performed well in 2014, exceeding expectations throughout the year and growing more in 1 year on an absolute basis than in any year in our history. As we enter 2015, we see continued strong momentum in our business across the board. Our biggest short-term challenge is currency. With over 90% of our business in our international brands and a significant majority of that being transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, mostly the euro and British pound but also to a lesser effect, the Brazilian real, Australian, Canadian dollars, Russian ruble, Thai baht and Turkish lira, this presents mostly a translation challenge. Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units or in constant currency remained strong. Unlike some other companies who have reported, our currency challenge again is largely a translational challenge and not a mismatch of revenue and expenses.
We remain steadfastly committed to our formula of out-executing and out-innovating the competition. We are in this game for the long run, making the smart and sustainable investments in our products and services every day of the year. We invest in profitable growth and are earning our customers' loyalty through superior customer offerings and branded experiences. We believe we have a winning, sustainable strategy and have observed a growing mix of direct business all year while delivering market-leading organic performance on both the top and bottom line. We also believe we can win with strong margins in the face of heated competition and have a long history of managing our costs extremely well and plan to continue our track record of strong leverage and margin management. All that said, we are also not afraid to use our resources to invest assertively when investments make sense, as we believe it currently does in online demand channels and most recently, into our OpenTable and BookingSuite investments, in particular.
We looked at various options to use our capital in the current environment. Today, we are announcing that the Priceline board has given us the authority to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We believe this is a good use of capital and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of the group. It has been a privilege this year -- past year as group CEO to lead a team of such talented and dedicated people at all the brands. There's no better job on the planet, in my opinion. I'm enthusiastic about all of the opportunities facing each of our brands. I want to thank our employees around the world for delivering another terrific year for their brands and for the group.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Q4 was a strong quarter from both a top and bottom line perspective. Unit growth is an important metric to focus on for our business to understand core performance excluding the impact of currency.
Room nights booked grew by 24% in the fourth quarter, decelerating modestly compared to 27% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 16% in Q4, reflecting accelerating retail growth, offset by a decrease for Name Your Own Price rental car reservations. Strong momentum in room night and rental car day unit growth has carried over into Q1 as we will see in a moment when we review Q1 guidance. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 1.5% for the consolidated group. Q4 gross bookings grew by about 23% on a local currency basis and by about 17% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year.
Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by about 27% on a local currency basis and by about 19% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 3%. The Priceline team is doing a great job improving the experience for customers on the website, which is driving nice conversion improvements. The results has been accelerating retail room nights and rental car growth. However, Name Your Own Price services continue to be hamstrung by lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 33% on a constant currency basis and by 26% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion, which grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 24% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $241 million, which represented 35% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated total worldwide revenue in Q4 of about $59 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.4% of gross profit for Q4, which is 132 bps lower than last year. Our operating margins reflect investments we made in offline advertising and other OpEx to build our brands and support growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to a less-than-forecasted year-over-year decline in online advertising ROIs.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $712 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $665 million and represents 23% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 22% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $755 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2014, which was about 36% above last year. We invested $41 million on CapEx and repurchased 443,000 shares of our common stock for $505 million in Q4. As Darren mentioned, earlier this month, our board authorized us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute the program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $8 billion at year end with about $1.2 billion of that balance in the U.S. We were pleased to recently receive a strong investment-grade credit rating from Moody's, which is in line with our current rating from S&P. This positions us well as we continue to monitor the debt markets in the U.S. and Europe for opportunities to raise capital at attractive rates. For full year 2014, Priceline Group grew room nights and gross bookings by 28%. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to about $3.5 billion and grew 29% while the business generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations. The company delivered an operating margin, expressed as non-GAAP operating income divided by gross profit, of 44.7%. 
I thank our people around the world for their hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results. Their talent and relentless execution to add properties, rental car suppliers and restaurants, continuously innovate on our websites and apps, and efficiently bring new customers to our brands with online and offline advertising is responsible for our success. I am also pleased with the balance of outstanding top line and bottom line growth in an ultra-competitive market. 
Now for Q1 guidance. I'd like to take a moment to talk about the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. As Darren mentioned, about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income for 2014 are generated by our international brands. Therefore, as we've seen in the past during the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, extreme volatility in foreign exchange rates significantly impacts our operating results as we translate them into U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the quarter are equal to yesterday's closing rates. At these exchange rates, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1 and the remainder of the year.
Specifically, our forecast for 2 of our most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, assumes rates remain at $1.14 per euro and $1.54 for British pound, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 17% for the euro and about 8% for the British pound for Q1 as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the $1.14 euro exchange rate assumed in our forecast is about 9% weaker than the $1.25 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q3 and most analysts last updated their forecasts. On the positive side, our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, so our expenses will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact.
However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 and slightly more pronounced in Q3. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in the resilient unit growth driving our forecasted total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis. We believe the true performance of our business will eventually show through in our U.S. dollar financial statements, when the dollar stabilizes relative to other currencies in general and the euro in particular. We are pleased with the high growth rates the business has consistently delivered over the past several years despite its size. The travel market remains fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our guidance reflects a strong start to the first quarter, and our assumption that are growth rates will decelerate as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter due to the size of our business.
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant currency basis and by 2% to 9% in U.S. dollars with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by slightly less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 4% to 11% and gross profit to grow by 21% to 28% on a local currency basis and by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q1. We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, driven mainly by nonadvertising operating expenses. 
As we have done in the past, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Our Q1 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to date and assumes increased pressure on ad efficiency throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we have experienced over the last couple of years. Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1, where we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality for our business. While we are not giving earnings guidance beyond Q1, we do expect pressure on operating margins from nonadvertising OpEx to significantly diminish as we proceed throughout the year and lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $475 million and $510 million, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.7 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $5.25 and $5.80 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income; do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies; and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter. Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general and in our key European market in particular, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions."

But we're not sensing overall that there are big issues with consumer demand in Europe. Now it's kind of a mixed bag. Certainly, Russian outbound is down, for obvious reasons, although Russian domestic travel is still quite strong. France, specifically, is still in a bit of a malaise both as a destination and as bookers. But that's made up for the fact that the Brits as bookers are very strong, the German as bookers are strong. And Southern Europe, it looks like it's going to be very popular this spring and summer. So overall, Europe is not -- the U.S. is definitely one of the hottest markets in the world, but Europe is holding up quite well, at least the early signs in 2015."

I guess I'll take both questions.

Thanks. This is Darren. I guess I'll take both questions. First of all, as it relates to what if, Travelocity, the pending deal with Orbitz -- it's hard, I'm not Expedia, so I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it sounds like a consolidation strategy. Our focus as a group is quite different than that. We're very focused primarily on organic growth and execution. And from an acquisition standpoint, we're focused on buying premium, winning brands that either add new geographies or business verticals or competencies, new channels that we can add to our existing brands. So if you look at our history as a group, whether it was buying Booking.com to compete in Europe, Agoda in Asia, rentalcars in rental cars, KAYAK in meta, OpenTable in restaurants, and then recently Buuteeq to help build our BookingSuite business, it's all been adjacent growth versus doubling and tripling down on similar brands. I don't -- my own view is I don't see the deal that Expedia has made, if it passes, as being a negative for our group. I think, if anything, it consolidates, clarifies competition. And there's still plenty of room to grow. If you think travel market was a $1 trillion market, recently someone said it was a $1.3 trillion market. So if you add both all of our business and Expedia's business together, it's still less than 10% of the total opportunity space. And if you look at the U.S. specifically, for us, it's all upside. And we plan to work very hard to continue to increase our share in the U.S. market. So to me, it just shows that there's just tremendous potential ahead and we're just staying very focused on what we do well. And I'm sure Expedia will do the same. So I don't see that overall as a negative. In terms of Expedia's growth rates, we obviously have always prided ourselves in being very highly profitable and continuing to grow very fast. I'm super proud of the 28% growth on top and bottom line that we printed in 2014. It's always good to remind you that when we talk about our room nights, they're all 100% organic. And that's just a very different result than what you're seeing with Expedia. But I do give them a lot of credit, they seem to have printed a great quarter, but we just have a different philosophy as it relates to building business for the long term. And then mobile specifically. Yes, mobile is -- I've been here now 3.5 years and it's, by far, the biggest thing that's changed in our business. And it's causing all sorts of issues and questions in terms of how do you generate demand, how do you build experiences. But as I've always said, for an e-commerce player like us, mobile is a net-net positive. It's allowing us to serve customers over multiple screens. And whether they arrive first on a phone or a tablet or a PC, it's not important to us, it's how do we basically become relevant to them other than being just a transaction. How does OpenTable or Booking or Agoda create more relevancy in the end-to-end experience that they're having on a local basis? True enough, we do spend money on buying business that originates on mobile phones. And that market is still -- it's still not the most perfect market, it's still quite chaotic. But we feel we've gotten a lot smarter about how we buy our business. Some brands are very app-driven, if you look at OpenTable or KAYAK. Other brands are very mobile Web-driven. And then brands like Booking have a little bit of both. And we feel, if anything, our -- the skills that we've built on the desktop, we're feeling as good, if not better, about the skills that we're applying in the mobile environment to buying new demand. And I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree -- because we have a common ROI standard, I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree has driven us to any lower standards. If anything, the one real positive is it's driving more of our business direct to our brands versus having to buy it."

Since we bought it, we've made a massive investment in replatforming the OpenTable B2B software. It's now going to be all cloud-based. The whole front end has been replatformed, so we can run A/B experimentation on it. There's been a lot of best practice sharing. You're going to see the OpenTable product now improve at a very dramatic pace because we've put it on to this new, modern, cloud-based platform. We've also now posted our positions and are beginning hiring for a number of international cities. I'll let you do your own research there in terms of which cities we're expanding into. So I would say its time to date has been a lot of best practice sharing, getting some of the plumbing done and 2015 for us is a big investment year for OpenTable. And as we've always said, we're going here to create something that is going to be truly a global platform and a modern e-commerce platform, and we're -- we remain very bullish on the opportunity with that asset. And it certainly to date has been performing about the level that we had expected it to. But really the best is yet to come. And when it relates to BookingSuite, we bought Buuteeq and a smaller company called Hotel Ninjas. That team now has been completely brought into Booking.com. We've rebranded it BookingSuite. We're now in the market with a number of products, mostly website products. The demand of those products is very strong. And we're just now in a rhythm of really trying to scale the old Buuteeq business now that's fully integrated with Booking. And the receptivity from the market has been very strong. So what we're doing there is building out a SaaS-based business. It takes a little bit of time to get going, but it's a really nice annuity revenue stream. But almost as importantly, it's bringing us closer to our hotel partners and showing that as a company, we can add value to them as well as a marketing services software provider. And then finally, with Ctrip, there, I'd say that the biggest highlight has been a significantly growing outbound business both with Agoda and Booking.com on Ctrip. That reflects, of course, a very strong Chinese market. We've also seen our non-Ctrip business, by the way, growing very strong. So Ctrip now is a branded experience. So customers are learning about Booking.com and Agoda. And that's obviously very valuable to us. The other side of the Ctrip deal was getting Ctrip hotels onto the Booking.com website. We now have, let's call it, a few handfuls of their hotels on our website. It's taken a little bit longer because we've had to work to make those hotels and to upgrade the product so that it was at the level of the product that we have on our website otherwise. But we're getting good traction there and we look in the coming quarters to significantly accelerate our rollout of Ctrip properties in China. I've mentioned this before, but one of our biggest challenges in China is most business at Chinese hotels is domestic. And we really are very strong on inbound and outbound. And the Ctrip product portfolio is going to allow us to also have a very competitive selection of properties for domestic Chinese guests as well. So those are the 3 -- Ctrip, in particular, you've all followed it. They've -- they're in a super competitive environment. We're really supportive of James and his team. We think they have the strongest hand in the market. And we still believe that today and we're proud of the deal we have. And we're working really closely with them as they fight the competitive battles that they're fighting, which has largely been a domestic Chinese challenge."

I guess I'll ask this a different way. But as you guys move away from paid search as a marketing channel, do you see the online marketing, as a percent of gross profit, staying in this kind of 31% range? Or could that get better one day?

Yes, with respect to Airbnb, we have a lot of respect for what they're doing. It is still -- as good as their website is, it's still a relatively high-friction process of booking on Airbnb. But the whole sharing economy peer-to-peer is a real force. I'll remind people that on average every day, we have more than 1 million guests, if you do the math. And if you look at the total number of units that are actually bookable on Booking.com, it far exceeds what's available on Airbnb. The interesting dynamic is really happening in the vacation rental space. We're coming into the market with an instantly bookable, immediately confirmable product. They're coming from the bottom-up with the sharing economy. And there is a lot of interest among our consumers in self-catered products. And whether that product ultimately ends up being somebody's sofa or being an aparthotel room in Paris, nobody knows. But one of the things that Airbnb is really helping us with is the rules in this space have traditionally been very foggy and gray. And city-by-city around the world, the rules are now getting written, and that helps us a lot because we're always going to play on the white side of the rules. But they've always been a little bit foggy. And we'll see where that all goes at the end of the day. There seems  -- we don't see a big impact on hotel demand based on this new advent of what I would call self-catered demand. And that's all up, Airbnb, us, other players. But maybe one day, you'll see that shift. And obviously, the big hotel brands, I don't think, are sitting still either. We see a lot of properties, for instance, in Europe, where they'll have the hotel, and then they have an apartment block behind the hotel. You use the hotel front desk, but then as a family, you might stay in the apartment, and that's -- that kind of new behavior is a reaction, I think, to some of this current trend at least. And then as it relates to mobile unit economics, I should also qualify that mobile Web search is primarily still a Google business. And it is working better and better. So when we -- even when we acquire a customer on the phone, one of the best ways to do it is through Google and through their Web search. But as I look forward, what we have generally done, as our business has become more direct, we're leaning even heavier into some of these channels. We certainly keep ROI standards, but I can't particularly say if long, long term online will be a lesser percentage. But we will continue to adjust our marketing mix. And we think at our margin level that we need to keep throwing out the fishing net to find more and more customers. And we're not satisfied just to work off the loyalty of our existing customer base. So a lot of it depends on the opportunity to cast the fishing net in an ROI-positive fashion. And it's hard to really predict that based on the competitive dynamics in some of these markets. But certainly, what you're seeing, the one thing that is real is we're having to adjust our marketing mix over time based on mobile specifically but also based on the ability of, let's call it, the non-Google participants to create products that are ROI-positive for us. And we are seeing progress in places like Facebook, for instance, and others, where they're improving the ability for direct response performance marketers, like The Priceline Group, to buy their product. And that's a real good thing for us because it hadn't been that case traditionally in the past."

What I will say is the vacation rental business is outgrowing our business. And so the next time we say a number, maybe we'll do it a year from the first time we said the number, you can think about it in that way. So it's becoming a greater proportion of our business. I always also flag to you, you've got to be careful with property count. That's why we added the vacation rental sub-number because those properties do come in with less units than our traditional hotels. And that's why you will see our property count continue to expand at a rate faster than our overall business because we're bringing on less units per property. And I think that will continue to be the case going forward. I say that and I don't -- and we're not, by any means, done with acquisitions. There's a lot more to do -- and the next move in vacation rentals is to really address the homeowner versus property managed vacation rental product. And we're well on our way to doing that. And in terms of acquisitions or opportunity space, number one, I would say, we have a lot to digest right now. And we're in what I consider to be the most attractive spaces. And the addition of restaurants is just an amazing opportunity for the group. Air is a very low-margin business. And it's rife with customer service concerns. And our play in air right now is a little piece at Priceline. But also of course, KAYAK, which plays off of both OTAs and direct air. And even though air is not a very attractive business from an EBITDA perspective, it is an important part of travel. And we want to make sure that whatever we do in air, that we remain relevant in air. And certainly, with over 90 partnerships at airlines all around the world, including Ryanair and easyJet and KLM, et cetera, we play an important partnership of how do you monetize air into things like hotel bookings. But as I look forward, yes, attractions are interesting. We're doing a lot of experimentation right now with various elements of cross-sell. So always, we're looking at things that, yes, we can make money off of, but much more importantly, what are the things that we can cross-sell that improves the experience for the consumer and enhances their loyalty. So if you follow Booking right now, for instance, you'll see us do a lot of pretrip emails, and you'll see us now, we have the insider guides to the top cities in the world. And within those guides, you'll see us testing and experimenting with various things. But again we're not going to become the tchotchke shop that sells 50 different things to just make a little bit more money. We're really cognizant of what does the user really want us to do. And if any of those things gets big traction, then we'll figure out should we enter the space organically, through acquisition or some -- or an alliance or some other mode is the way I think about it. But at this specific moment, we've got our hands full and we're by and large focused on organic execution."

No, I -- every -- since we started, primarily focusing on hotels, even moving into bed and breakfast and hostels and even treehouses and igloos and everything we've added to the site has presented new challenges. And what we do is we bring it in, we experiment with it, we adjust our business system. Recently, we've rolled out a simple Extranet, and we've got a lot of other things in the pipeline to specifically address the needs, all the way down to the single unit, single property, single owner model. I mean, that's ultimately, as a company, it's our destination. We're here to be the world's largest inventory and selection of accommodations at the best price, with the simplest experience. And this very much fit that. I don't -- I honestly don't believe the challenges are insurmountable. But it takes a lot of work in an industry that's traditionally operated in a very different fashion than modern e-commerce, which is the ability to buy things at a price and be able to actually book them without ever having to talk to the seller of the product. And that's what we're working towards. And frankly, I'm quite optimistic, not that we have the answer to everything at this moment, but we've got really smart teams working on this right now.

And I think of the much bigger opportunity is cross-promotion, meaning, a, ""I live in Italy and I love using Booking.com, oh, and you can also do that with restaurants?"" And that's the part that we've seen the biggest interest. If we look at our insider guides and our pretrip emails, the biggest thing people are interested in who book accommodations is restaurants, the restaurants nearby where they've booked. And the ability on that first night, if they're arriving late, where can I eat? Many of our hotels have restaurants, and that's a competitive thing within the space that the person's sitting in there. And now we're absolutely confident that there's significant interest in that. What we need to then get, of course, is great relevant content, get the OpenTable reviews, the photos, et cetera, and really lace those 2 things together. But we're quite optimistic. I say all of that and OpenTable's proposition is not going to grow as a primary just because of Booking.com. OpenTable will need to stand on its own as a business, which it has in the United States and I'm confident will internationally. Booking.com will be a nice new group of tens of millions of customers that we can introduce the concept to. And that's what -- that's really the way I think about it versus get a hotel booking, get a restaurant booking, although, by the way, we've tested that, it works. But it's not like the biggest idea in terms of the synergy between the brands."

I guess, it's as much my philosophy as some of the brand CEOs. And I grew up at Starbucks and other places, where my own view and what we've seen in the data is that customers are most loyal when you give them a great experience. And that's what we've really been focused on. And it's driven -- if you look at repeat behavior, if you look at number of bookings, share of wallet in a year, we've seen in our biggest brands, who don't have a formal ""loyalty"" program, significant increases in those kind of metrics every single year that we've been in business. So that's what we focus on. Now the other question though is for high-volume travel, what do you do? And most of our business is built off of leisure travelers, who don't actually book that often. But for high-volume travel, it seems like loyalty is an aspect. By the way, it's a very deep aspect more in the United States than it is in many other parts of the world, where people take a lot more leisure travel versus pure business travel. So we've always been interested in what is the role of points in loyalty programs, what role should the group play in that. By the way, some of these programs, you think they drive people to be more loyal, but they can actually make them more dissatisfied with you because people will give you points and then make it harder and harder for you to use your points. That's what marketers do. And CFOs do it as well, looking at Dan. So there's always caution with these things. But we're obviously very interested. It hasn't been a big issue for us in the past. But when you do look at specific pockets of high-volume travelers, that's where probably we have the greatest going-forward interest in this topic."

I think another thing I would add to your list, it's NHAs [ph],  it's things like Booking Now, they basically like not to go to Paris or London or New York. They like to just wander off into the countryside. Many of them don't have computers, they only have phones. So it's thinking of all of those things and as well as having product on the site. We're one of the world leaders in hostels. If you go to any hostel in Europe, a lot of people are using Booking.com to book hostels. So making sure that we're relevant to this next generation of travelers is also helping us make sure we're relevant with the emerging lifestyles of the consumers. And so we do a lot of work, not -- I wouldn't say traditional marketing work, like we're not buying ads on just programs that millennials watch. That's never been something we do. But we target them more from a data perspective and also making sure that the product that we have is relevant to their lifestyles. And at least the data that we see shows that we have a very large group of young people who use Booking.com on a regular basis. Even backpacking through Europe, we're a relevant thing. We're not just a rich person's product. And that obviously keeps the brand healthy. And we hope that the hostel stayers become hotel bookers, et cetera, through their life cycle. But it's a great question. And certainly, watching my own children, the world is changing very, very fast.

Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here with Priceline Group CFO Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $10.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year or about 23% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.85, up 23% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $10.10 per share and our guidance for the quarter. For the full year, The Priceline Group reported gross bookings of just over $50 billion, 346 million room nights, $3.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share of $53.31, all up about 28% year-over-year.
Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com, which now has over 600,000 hotels and other accommodations in 212 countries and territories, up 41% over last year. Booking.com continues to invest aggressively in its global supply platform, building substantially differentiated hotel and accommodation supply, content and availability. Much of that growth in supply is driven by vacation rentals, which more than doubled to 247,000 properties, including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products, all of which are instantly confirmable. It is important to note that because many of our vacation rental properties have multiple units, our 247,000 properties actually represent over 1 million instantly bookable and confirmable units within these properties. We continue to believe in the large untapped potential of the global vacation rental opportunity, which has historically been burdened by a high-friction research and fulfillment process. 
In addition to aggressively growing our number of accommodation partners, the group invested nearly $2.6 billion in marketing during the year. While the preponderance of that investment was in online channels, Booking.com continued to build its offline competencies. Following successful TV launches in the U.S. and Australia in 2013, we also ran effective campaigns in the U.K., Canada and Germany. We are pleased with the return on total advertising we are seeing in these markets, and we'll continue to explore new markets where the data tells us it makes sense to diversify our ad spend.
2014 was a tale of 2 cities for priceline.com with solid growth in its retail businesses offset by declines in its opaque businesses. We believe the pressure in opaque is reflective of a historically healthy overall travel environment in the United States, which is beneficial to the balance of our group-wide business.
The fast-growing Asia-Pacific market was another critical component to the group's success in 2014. We believe Agoda.com and Booking.com lead the region in intra-Asian hotel and accommodation bookings. And we're now harvesting the fruit of our new commercial agreement with Ctrip that we entered last year. China is a material and fast-growing portion of our Asia Pacific business, and we are leaning into that opportunity in a smart and responsible fashion. 
Rentalcars.com accelerated in Q4, comping a quarter last year in which it also accelerated. Rentalcars exited 2014 from a position of strength and has seen its momentum continue into 2015. KAYAK delivered an outstanding first full year as part of the group, delivering strong top line results, and bottom line results significantly exceeded our expectations at the time of acquisition. KAYAK is heads down innovating to extend its product leadership and build its brand in Europe. Early signs for KAYAK in 2015 are so far quite positive.
OpenTable, our newest member to the group, remains very busy laying the groundwork for its cloud-based replatforming and international expansion. As I mentioned on the last call, our vision for OpenTable is expansive. And 2015 will be a year of profitable investment. It will take time to staff and scale a European sales organization. And there is no shortage of product enhancements, internal plumbing improvements and infrastructure investments to make so that OpenTable is best positioned to scale to its true global potential. I will have more to share on OpenTable's progress as the year unfolds, but we are optimistic from everything we are seeing so far, and our team is super motivated. In the U.S., OpenTable continues to achieve high diner growth as it transitions its restaurant base to its cloud-based offering and continues its rollout of Pay with OpenTable. 
Mobile remains a continued bright spot for all of our brands. Just this past week, Booking.com exceeded 100,000 gross transactions, that's before cancellations or amendments, on just mobile phones on 2 different days. And we are still not in high season for bookings. On January 15, we also launched Booking Now on the Apple platform in the United States. Booking Now is our app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers. Our international launch of Booking Now, including the addition of all of our supported languages, will start in earnest next week.
Priceline.com leads the group in the percentage of travel bookings completed on mobile, on some days now approaching 50%. KAYAK and OpenTable both have flourishing businesses on their apps, especially in the United States, which drives strong repeat traffic. From a very small part of our business just a few years ago, mobile has become a mission-critical part of the group, both to deliver transactions and to deliver great end-to-end experiences for our guests. Excellent execution on our mobile platforms has been critical to the group's success and overall market share gains this year.
The group performed well in 2014, exceeding expectations throughout the year and growing more in 1 year on an absolute basis than in any year in our history. As we enter 2015, we see continued strong momentum in our business across the board. Our biggest short-term challenge is currency. With over 90% of our business in our international brands and a significant majority of that being transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, mostly the euro and British pound but also to a lesser effect, the Brazilian real, Australian, Canadian dollars, Russian ruble, Thai baht and Turkish lira, this presents mostly a translation challenge. Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units or in constant currency remained strong. Unlike some other companies who have reported, our currency challenge again is largely a translational challenge and not a mismatch of revenue and expenses.
We remain steadfastly committed to our formula of out-executing and out-innovating the competition. We are in this game for the long run, making the smart and sustainable investments in our products and services every day of the year. We invest in profitable growth and are earning our customers' loyalty through superior customer offerings and branded experiences. We believe we have a winning, sustainable strategy and have observed a growing mix of direct business all year while delivering market-leading organic performance on both the top and bottom line. We also believe we can win with strong margins in the face of heated competition and have a long history of managing our costs extremely well and plan to continue our track record of strong leverage and margin management. All that said, we are also not afraid to use our resources to invest assertively when investments make sense, as we believe it currently does in online demand channels and most recently, into our OpenTable and BookingSuite investments, in particular.
We looked at various options to use our capital in the current environment. Today, we are announcing that the Priceline board has given us the authority to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We believe this is a good use of capital and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of the group. It has been a privilege this year -- past year as group CEO to lead a team of such talented and dedicated people at all the brands. There's no better job on the planet, in my opinion. I'm enthusiastic about all of the opportunities facing each of our brands. I want to thank our employees around the world for delivering another terrific year for their brands and for the group.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Q4 was a strong quarter from both a top and bottom line perspective. Unit growth is an important metric to focus on for our business to understand core performance excluding the impact of currency.
Room nights booked grew by 24% in the fourth quarter, decelerating modestly compared to 27% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 16% in Q4, reflecting accelerating retail growth, offset by a decrease for Name Your Own Price rental car reservations. Strong momentum in room night and rental car day unit growth has carried over into Q1 as we will see in a moment when we review Q1 guidance. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 1.5% for the consolidated group. Q4 gross bookings grew by about 23% on a local currency basis and by about 17% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year.
Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by about 27% on a local currency basis and by about 19% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 3%. The Priceline team is doing a great job improving the experience for customers on the website, which is driving nice conversion improvements. The results has been accelerating retail room nights and rental car growth. However, Name Your Own Price services continue to be hamstrung by lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 33% on a constant currency basis and by 26% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion, which grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 24% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $241 million, which represented 35% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated total worldwide revenue in Q4 of about $59 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.4% of gross profit for Q4, which is 132 bps lower than last year. Our operating margins reflect investments we made in offline advertising and other OpEx to build our brands and support growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to a less-than-forecasted year-over-year decline in online advertising ROIs.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $712 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $665 million and represents 23% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 22% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $755 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2014, which was about 36% above last year. We invested $41 million on CapEx and repurchased 443,000 shares of our common stock for $505 million in Q4. As Darren mentioned, earlier this month, our board authorized us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute the program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $8 billion at year end with about $1.2 billion of that balance in the U.S. We were pleased to recently receive a strong investment-grade credit rating from Moody's, which is in line with our current rating from S&P. This positions us well as we continue to monitor the debt markets in the U.S. and Europe for opportunities to raise capital at attractive rates. For full year 2014, Priceline Group grew room nights and gross bookings by 28%. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to about $3.5 billion and grew 29% while the business generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations. The company delivered an operating margin, expressed as non-GAAP operating income divided by gross profit, of 44.7%. 
I thank our people around the world for their hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results. Their talent and relentless execution to add properties, rental car suppliers and restaurants, continuously innovate on our websites and apps, and efficiently bring new customers to our brands with online and offline advertising is responsible for our success. I am also pleased with the balance of outstanding top line and bottom line growth in an ultra-competitive market. 
Now for Q1 guidance. I'd like to take a moment to talk about the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. As Darren mentioned, about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income for 2014 are generated by our international brands. Therefore, as we've seen in the past during the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, extreme volatility in foreign exchange rates significantly impacts our operating results as we translate them into U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the quarter are equal to yesterday's closing rates. At these exchange rates, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1 and the remainder of the year.
Specifically, our forecast for 2 of our most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, assumes rates remain at $1.14 per euro and $1.54 for British pound, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 17% for the euro and about 8% for the British pound for Q1 as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the $1.14 euro exchange rate assumed in our forecast is about 9% weaker than the $1.25 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q3 and most analysts last updated their forecasts. On the positive side, our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, so our expenses will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact.
However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 and slightly more pronounced in Q3. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in the resilient unit growth driving our forecasted total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis. We believe the true performance of our business will eventually show through in our U.S. dollar financial statements, when the dollar stabilizes relative to other currencies in general and the euro in particular. We are pleased with the high growth rates the business has consistently delivered over the past several years despite its size. The travel market remains fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our guidance reflects a strong start to the first quarter, and our assumption that are growth rates will decelerate as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter due to the size of our business.
For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant currency basis and by 2% to 9% in U.S. dollars with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by slightly less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 4% to 11% and gross profit to grow by 21% to 28% on a local currency basis and by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q1. We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, driven mainly by nonadvertising operating expenses. 
As we have done in the past, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Our Q1 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to date and assumes increased pressure on ad efficiency throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we have experienced over the last couple of years. Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1, where we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality for our business. While we are not giving earnings guidance beyond Q1, we do expect pressure on operating margins from nonadvertising OpEx to significantly diminish as we proceed throughout the year and lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $475 million and $510 million, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.7 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $5.25 and $5.80 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income; do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies; and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter. Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general and in our key European market in particular, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions."

But we're not sensing overall that there are big issues with consumer demand in Europe. Now it's kind of a mixed bag. Certainly, Russian outbound is down, for obvious reasons, although Russian domestic travel is still quite strong. France, specifically, is still in a bit of a malaise both as a destination and as bookers. But that's made up for the fact that the Brits as bookers are very strong, the German as bookers are strong. And Southern Europe, it looks like it's going to be very popular this spring and summer. So overall, Europe is not -- the U.S. is definitely one of the hottest markets in the world, but Europe is holding up quite well, at least the early signs in 2015."

I guess I'll take both questions. First of all, as it relates to what if, Travelocity, the pending deal with Orbitz -- it's hard, I'm not Expedia, so I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it",713,"Okay, Justin. Thanks. This is Darren. I guess I'll take both questions. First of all, as it relates to what if, Travelocity, the pending deal with Orbitz -- it's hard, I'm not Expedia, so I can't exactly -- I don't know exactly what they're doing, but it sounds like a consolidation strategy. Our focus as a group is quite different than that. We're very focused primarily on organic growth and execution. And from an acquisition standpoint, we're focused on buying premium, winning brands that either add new geographies or business verticals or competencies, new channels that we can add to our existing brands. So if you look at our history as a group, whether it was buying Booking.com to compete in Europe, Agoda in Asia, rentalcars in rental cars, KAYAK in meta, OpenTable in restaurants, and then recently Buuteeq to help build our BookingSuite business, it's all been adjacent growth versus doubling and tripling down on similar brands. I don't -- my own view is I don't see the deal that Expedia has made, if it passes, as being a negative for our group. I think, if anything, it consolidates, clarifies competition. And there's still plenty of room to grow. If you think travel market was a $1 trillion market, recently someone said it was a $1.3 trillion market. So if you add both all of our business and Expedia's business together, it's still less than 10% of the total opportunity space. And if you look at the U.S. specifically, for us, it's all upside. And we plan to work very hard to continue to increase our share in the U.S. market. So to me, it just shows that there's just tremendous potential ahead and we're just staying very focused on what we do well. And I'm sure Expedia will do the same. So I don't see that overall as a negative. In terms of Expedia's growth rates, we obviously have always prided ourselves in being very highly profitable and continuing to grow very fast. I'm super proud of the 28% growth on top and bottom line that we printed in 2014. It's always good to remind you that when we talk about our room nights, they're all 100% organic. And that's just a very different result than what you're seeing with Expedia. But I do give them a lot of credit, they seem to have printed a great quarter, but we just have a different philosophy as it relates to building business for the long term. And then mobile specifically. Yes, mobile is -- I've been here now 3.5 years and it's, by far, the biggest thing that's changed in our business. And it's causing all sorts of issues and questions in terms of how do you generate demand, how do you build experiences. But as I've always said, for an e-commerce player like us, mobile is a net-net positive. It's allowing us to serve customers over multiple screens. And whether they arrive first on a phone or a tablet or a PC, it's not important to us, it's how do we basically become relevant to them other than being just a transaction. How does OpenTable or Booking or Agoda create more relevancy in the end-to-end experience that they're having on a local basis? True enough, we do spend money on buying business that originates on mobile phones. And that market is still -- it's still not the most perfect market, it's still quite chaotic. But we feel we've gotten a lot smarter about how we buy our business. Some brands are very app-driven, if you look at OpenTable or KAYAK. Other brands are very mobile Web-driven. And then brands like Booking have a little bit of both. And we feel, if anything, our -- the skills that we've built on the desktop, we're feeling as good, if not better, about the skills that we're applying in the mobile environment to buying new demand. And I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree -- because we have a common ROI standard, I don't think the increase in mobile to any degree has driven us to any lower standards. If anything, the one real positive is it's driving more of our business direct to our brands versus having to buy it."

Since we bought it, we've made a massive investment in replatforming the OpenTable B2B software. It's now going to be all cloud-based. The whole front end has been replatformed, so we can run A/B experimentation on it. There's been a lot of best practice sharing. You're going to see the OpenTable product now improve at a very dramatic pace because we've put it on to this new, modern, cloud-based platform. We've also now posted our positions and are beginning hiring for a number of international cities. I'll let you do your own research there in terms of which cities we're expanding into. So I would say its time to date has been a lot of best practice sharing, getting some of the plumbing done and 2015 for us is a big investment year for OpenTable. And as we've always said, we're going here to create something that is going to be truly a global platform and a modern e-commerce platform, and we're -- we remain very bullish on the opportunity with that asset. And it certainly to date has been performing about the level that we had expected it to. But really the best is yet to come. And when it relates to BookingSuite, we bought Buuteeq and a smaller company called Hotel Ninjas. That team now has been completely brought into Booking.com. We've rebranded it BookingSuite. We're now in the market with a number of products, mostly website products. The demand of those products is very strong. And we're just now in a rhythm of really trying to scale the old Buuteeq business now that's fully integrated with Booking. And the receptivity from the market has been very strong. So what we're doing there is building out a SaaS-based business. It takes a little bit of time to get going, but it's a really nice annuity revenue stream. But almost as importantly, it's bringing us closer to our hotel partners and showing that as a company, we can add value to them as well as a marketing services software provider. And then finally, with Ctrip, there, I'd say that the biggest highlight has been a significantly growing outbound business both with Agoda and Booking.com on Ctrip. That reflects, of course, a very strong Chinese market. We've also seen our non-Ctrip business, by the way, growing very strong. So Ctrip now is a branded experience. So customers are learning about Booking.com and Agoda. And that's obviously very valuable to us. The other side of the Ctrip deal was getting Ctrip hotels onto the Booking.com website. We now have, let's call it, a few handfuls of their hotels on our website. It's taken a little bit longer because we've had to work to make those hotels and to upgrade the product so that it was at the level of the product that we have on our website otherwise. But we're getting good traction there and we look in the coming quarters to significantly accelerate our rollout of Ctrip properties in China. I've mentioned this before, but one of our biggest challenges in China is most business at Chinese hotels is domestic. And we really are very strong on inbound and outbound. And the Ctrip product portfolio is going to allow us to also have a very competitive selection of properties for domestic Chinese guests as well. So those are the 3 -- Ctrip, in particular, you've all followed it. They've -- they're in a super competitive environment. We're really supportive of James and his team. We think they have the strongest hand in the market. And we still believe that today and we're proud of the deal we have. And we're working really closely with them as they fight the competitive battles that they're fighting, which has largely been a domestic Chinese challenge."

Yes, with respect to Airbnb, we have a lot of respect for what they're doing. It is still -- as good as their website is, it's still a relatively high-friction process of booking on Airbnb. But the whole sharing economy peer-to-peer is a real force. I'll remind people that on average every day, we have more than 1 million guests, if you do the math. And if you look at the total number of units that are actually bookable on Booking.com, it far exceeds what's available on Airbnb. The interesting dynamic is really happening in the vacation rental space. We're coming into the market with an instantly bookable, immediately confirmable product. They're coming from the bottom-up with the sharing economy. And there is a lot of interest among our consumers in self-catered products. And whether that product ultimately ends up being somebody's sofa or being an aparthotel room in Paris, nobody knows. But one of the things that Airbnb is really helping us with is the rules in this space have traditionally been very foggy and gray. And city-by-city around the world, the rules are now getting written, and that helps us a lot because we're always going to play on the white side of the rules. But they've always been a little bit foggy. And we'll see where that all goes at the end of the day. There seems -- we don't see a big impact on hotel demand based on this new advent of what I would call self-catered demand. And that's all up, Airbnb, us, other players. But maybe one day, you'll see that shift. And obviously, the big hotel brands, I don't think, are sitting still either. We see a lot of properties, for instance, in Europe, where they'll have the hotel, and then they have an apartment block behind the hotel. You use the hotel front desk, but then as a family, you might stay in the apartment, and that's -- that kind of new behavior is a reaction, I think, to some of this current trend at least. And then as it relates to mobile unit economics, I should also qualify that mobile Web search is primarily still a Google business. And it is working better and better. So when we -- even when we acquire a customer on the phone, one of the best ways to do it is through Google and through their Web search. But as I look forward, what we have generally done, as our business has become more direct, we're leaning even heavier into some of these channels. We certainly keep ROI standards, but I can't particularly say if long, long term online will be a lesser percentage. But we will continue to adjust our marketing mix. And we think at our margin level that we need to keep throwing out the fishing net to find more and more customers. And we're not satisfied just to work off the loyalty of our existing customer base. So a lot of it depends on the opportunity to cast the fishing net in an ROI-positive fashion. And it's hard to really predict that based on the competitive dynamics in some of these markets. But certainly, what you're seeing, the one thing that is real is we're having to adjust our marketing mix over time based on mobile specifically but also based on the ability of, let's call it, the non-Google participants to create products that are ROI-positive for us.

What I will say is the vacation rental business is outgrowing our business. And so the next time we say a number, maybe we'll do it a year from the first time we said the number, you can think about it in that way. So it's becoming a greater proportion of our business. I always also flag to you, you've got to be careful with property count. That's why we added the vacation rental sub-number because those properties do come in with less units than our traditional hotels. And that's why you will see our property count continue to expand at a rate faster than our overall business because we're bringing on less units per property. And I think that will continue to be the case going forward. I say that and I don't -- and we're not, by any means, done with acquisitions. There's a lot more to do -- and the next move in vacation rentals is to really address the homeowner versus property managed vacation rental product. And we're well on our way to doing that. And in terms of acquisitions or opportunity space, number one, I would say, we have a lot to digest right now. And we're in what I consider to be the most attractive spaces. And the addition of restaurants is just an amazing opportunity for the group. Air is a very low-margin business. And it's rife with customer service concerns. And our play in air right now is a little piece at Priceline. But also of course, KAYAK, which plays off of both OTAs and direct air. And even though air is not a very attractive business from an EBITDA perspective, it is an important part of travel. And we want to make sure that whatever we do in air, that we remain relevant in air. And certainly, with over 90 partnerships at airlines all around the world, including Ryanair and easyJet and KLM, et cetera, we play an important partnership of how do you monetize air into things like hotel bookings. But as I look forward, yes, attractions are interesting. We're doing a lot of experimentation right now with various elements of cross-sell. So always, we're looking at things that, yes, we can make money off of, but much more importantly, what are the things that we can cross-sell that improves the experience for the consumer and enhances their loyalty. So if you follow Booking right now, for instance, you'll see us do a lot of pretrip emails, and you'll see us now, we have the insider guides to the top cities in the world. And within those guides, you'll see us testing and experimenting with various things. But again we're not going to become the tchotchke shop that sells 50 different things to just make a little bit more money. We're really cognizant of what does the user really want us to do. And if any of those things gets big traction, then we'll figure out should we enter the space organically, through acquisition or some -- or an alliance or some other mode is the way I think about it. But at this specific moment, we've got our hands full and we're by and large focused on organic execution."

But it takes a lot of work in an industry that's traditionally operated in a very different fashion than modern e-commerce, which is the ability to buy things at a price and be able to actually book them without ever having to talk to the seller of the product.

And I think of the much bigger opportunity is cross-promotion, meaning, a, ""I live in Italy and I love using Booking.com, oh, and you can also do that with restaurants?"" And that's the part that we've seen the biggest interest. If we look at our insider guides and our pretrip emails, the biggest thing people are interested in who book accommodations is restaurants, the restaurants nearby where they've booked. And the ability on that first night, if they're arriving late, where can I eat? Many of our hotels have restaurants, and that's a competitive thing within the space that the person's sitting in there. And now we're absolutely confident that there's significant interest in that. What we need to then get, of course, is great relevant content, get the OpenTable reviews, the photos, et cetera, and really lace those 2 things together. But we're quite optimistic. I say all of that and OpenTable's proposition is not going to grow as a primary just because of Booking.com. OpenTable will need to stand on its own as a business, which it has in the United States and I'm confident will internationally. Booking.com will be a nice new group of tens of millions of customers that we can introduce the concept to. And that's what -- that's really the way I think about it versus get a hotel booking, get a restaurant booking, although, by the way, we've tested that, it works.

I guess, it's as much my philosophy as some of the brand CEOs. And I grew up at Starbucks and other places, where my own view and what we've seen in the data is that customers are most loyal when you give them a great experience. And that's what we've really been focused on. And it's driven -- if you look at repeat behavior, if you look at number of bookings, share of wallet in a year, we've seen in our biggest brands, who don't have a formal ""loyalty"" program, significant increases in those kind of metrics every single year that we've been in business. So that's what we focus on. Now the other question though is for high-volume travel, what do you do? And most of our business is built off of leisure travelers, who don't actually book that often. But for high-volume travel, it seems like loyalty is an aspect. By the way, it's a very deep aspect more in the United States than it is in many other parts of the world, where people take a lot more leisure travel versus pure business travel. So we've always been interested in what is the role of points in loyalty programs, what role should the group play in that. By the way, some of these programs, you think they drive people to be more loyal, but they can actually make them more dissatisfied with you because people will give you points and then make it harder and harder for you to use your points. That's what marketers do. And CFOs do it as well, looking at Dan. So there's always caution with these things. But we're obviously very interested. It hasn't been a big issue for us in the past. But when you do look at specific pockets of high-volume travelers, that's where probably we have the greatest going-forward interest in this topic."

We're one of the world leaders in hostels. If you go to any hostel in Europe, a lot of people are using Booking.com to book hostels. So making sure that we're relevant to this next generation of travelers is also helping us make sure we're relevant with the emerging lifestyles of the consumers. And so we do a lot of work, not -- I wouldn't say traditional marketing work, like we're not buying ads on just programs that millennials watch. That's never been something we do. But we target them more from a data perspective and also making sure that the product that we have is relevant to their lifestyles.

Thank you for joining us for the markets opened this morning in New York. 
I'm here in Amsterdam, with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $13.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year, or about 26% on a local-currency basis. 
Room nights exceeded $100 million for the first time during our quarter, while growth accelerated slightly to 25%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $8.12, up 4% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $7.72 per share in our guidance for the quarter. 
Our U.S. dollar denominated growth rates were substantially impacted by the stronger dollar.
Our International business recorded 29% gross bookings growth on a local-currency basis, up from 27% last quarter. Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com, which now has over 640,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 200 countries and territories, up 40% over last year. 
We are continuing to ramp new property acquisition, including individually-owned vacation rentals, with new onboarding tools that allow owners to list their property quickly and easily on our website. Vacation rentals nearly doubled year-over-year to 275,000, instantly bookable and confirmable properties,
including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products. 
Two important omissions were also launched to Booking.com in the fourth quarter: Booking Now, our mobile phone app for spontaneous brokers; and BookingSuite, our partner-facing Support Services platform.  Both launches were instituted well in early results are encouraging. Each of these growth extensions represent Innovation Beachhead that will be further expanded upon in the coming weeks, months, quarters. 
International results also benefited from agoda.com and rentalcars.com, both of which accelerated in the quarter. 
KAYAK and OpenTable continue to pursue the international opportunity, and while much merger has been done and both businesses are growing, there still a lot of potential ahead of us.
KAYAK is focused on product innovation and brand building, and has been some solid business progress, particularly in Europe. 
OpenTable has now more or less completed its technical re-platforming, to a more modern cloud-based architecture. We are now executing plans to optimize the product and rolling out globally.
Against these plans, we will take a determined but test-and-learn approach over the coming quarters as we have a with all our businesses. Demand for OpenTable solutions from both restaurants and customers, remains very strong. 
Priceline.com's domestic growth continued to be hampered by the shrinking of opaque Opie business. Priceline.com's Retail business remains healthy, including acceleration in the retail hotels and a new management team there, is poised to rejuvenate and maximize the potential of the priceline.com brand.
We also acquired rocket miles in the first quarter, and innovative hotel booking platform for frequent flyers based in Chicago. Rocket Miles is being managed independently, as part of our Priceline ventures portfolio. 
Mobile's uninterrupted growth in share of our business continues. From Booking.com's Booking Now app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers, to priceline.com's Iowa Chat, to our Pay with OpenTable moment -- mobile payments app, to KAYAK's mobile itinerary management tools, innovation and execution on mobile is entered D&A and critical to the group's continued success.
Across the group, our customers completed over 100 million reservations from their smartphones in the last 12 months and that number continues to grow very rapidly. 
We believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter and we're pleased with the progress of our brands and growing and improving their platforms. 
Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units and in constant currency, remains strong. We again, delivered strong organic performance on both the top and bottom line, providing substantial earnings to reinvest in profitable growth and share buybacks while maintaining attractive operating margins.
We repurchased $309 million of our common stock during the quarter, and have a remaining authorization of $2.8 billion remaining for future quarters. 
I believe it strongly as ever that our formula of out innovating the competition, smart and sustainable organic growth, and earnings versus buying our customers loyalty through best-in-class consumer experiences end-to-end and across devices, is the winning long-term formula.
I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn it over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials."
33254,290770601,806448,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015.As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported resul",1765,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015.
As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted more dramatically by extreme currency volatility than most companies because about 90% of our full-year 2014 gross bookings and operating income were generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 18% and 9%, respectively, for Q1, as compared to the prior year. The euro was also about 2% weaker, compared to the rate assumed in our Q1 guidance.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1, Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact.
However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 than the top line impact.
Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evidenced in our unit growth rates and our growth rates expressed in constant currency for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Priceline Group. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted resulted in over performance compared to consensus, at both the top and bottom line. 
Room nights growth was strong relative to Q4 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 25% in the first quarter, accelerating slightly, compared to the 24% growth rate for Q4. Rental car days grew by 18% in Q1, also accelerating compared to Q4, growth of 16%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 2015 were up on a constant-currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. 
Q1 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant-currency basis, and by about 12% in U.S. dollars, compared to the prior year.
International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant-currency basis, and by about 14% in U.S. dollars. 
Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the results are a mix of solid growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services, which continue to be challenged by a lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion, and grew by about 32% on a constant-currency basis, and by 19% in U.S., compared to prior year. 
Our international operations generated gross profit $1.4 billion, which grew by about 30% on a constant-currency basis, and by 15% in U.S., compared to prior year. 
Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $277 million, which represented 38% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q1 of about $61 [ph] million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 31.1% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q1, which is 448 bps lower than last year. 
As I said when we gave guidance for the quarter, we are investing in OpEx in people, offices and IT capacity, to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. 
Q1 also reflects deleverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. Online advertising also had de-leveraged due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that benefits revenue in Q2 and Q3, when eastern summer travel takes place.
Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1, when we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality of our business.
Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to lower than forecasted nonadvertising OpEx. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $532 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of  $510 million, and represents 4% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 3%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 4%. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $209 million of cash from operations during the first quarter 2015, which is about 18% above last year.
We invested $31 million in CapEx, and repurchased 251,000 shares of our common stock for $309 million in Q1. We expect to execute the remainder of our $3 billion common stock buyback program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
We completed 2 successful financing transactions in Q1 at attractive interest rates. We raised EUR 1 billion for our U.S. parent company, by offering a 12-year bond in Europe at a 1.8% interest rate. We also raised $500 million, by issuing a 10-year bond in the U.S. investment grade market with a 3.65% [ph] interest rate. 
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at March 31, 2015, with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q2 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective, broadly and in Europe. We are pleased with the resilient unit growth that our business has delivered historically, and is inherent in our Q2 forecast. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate for the quarter due to the size of our business.
Our Q2 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 19% for the euro, and about 11% for the British pound, as compared to the prior year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Borrowing further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that Q2 represents our toughest year-over-year currency comp for 2015.
For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 15% to 22% on a constant-currency basis, and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. 
We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant-currency basis, and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior-year period. We expect the Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 0 to 7%, and gross profit to grow by 17% to 24% on a local-currency basis, and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars. 
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q2.
We expect about 550 bps of de-leverage in non-GAAP operating margins, compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit.
Q2 forecast reflects the impact of investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q2 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. 
While we are not giving you earnings guidance beyond Q2, we do expect pressure on operating margins from nonadvertising OpEx to significantly diminish over the back half of the year as we lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Our Q2 advertising forecast assumes lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising, including rolling out campaigns in new markets. 
Our approach to advertising spend is consistent with our past approach. We invest in a manner that we believe is sustainable over the long-term, with the goal of building our brands with consumers. We then strive to win the loyalty of our customers by giving them the most choices and the best booking experience across all devices they use to search and book.  This approach has resulted in the nice balance between top and bottom-line growth, and loyal customers that overtime, are increasingly coming to us directly, rather than through paid channels.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $716 [ph] million and $765 million, which is the midpoint, is a decrease of 9% versus prior year. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to impacting for gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA growth this also impacted by de-leverage in operating margins just discussed.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes and Alternative Minimum Tax and state income taxes in the U.S. The non-GAAP EPS forecast also reflects the dilutive impact of a full quarter of interest expense from the bond offerings we did in Q1, without any assumed share repurchases we may make using the proceeds.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS of approximately $10.95 to $11.75 per share, which of the midpoint is, a decrease of 9% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 52.8 million shares, based upon yesterday's closing stock price. 
We forecast GAAP EPS between $8.85 and $9.65 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter, although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general, and our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.
We will now take your questions."

And as you know, we have 2 big brands in Asia: Agoda and Booking.com. And together, we have a really strong business. Agoda has traditionally been a business in South East Asian bookers, but it's really expended nicely to include a lot of North Asian bookers and Oceana. At the same time, Booking.com, which started the European business, has had a lot of success expanding into Asia. And really, the real strength of the 2 brands is in -- Asians moving around Asia. So you have a lot of movement right now, between China and Japan, Taiwan and Japan, Korea and Japan, there's a lot of movement also, Australia going to Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is going to North Asia. So we've participate then in a lot of the movement within Asia. And both brands continues to grow and have a lot of success. China, specifically, is an amazing market. We have our relationship with Ctrip. We are constant meeting with the team. I've just got back from China. I met with James and Jane, and it's turning out to be a great partnership. Our Outbound business with them is up quite significantly year-over-year. That said, we have more work to do still. We have an onboarded Ctrip's inventories as fast as I'd hope. There are a lot of issues that we're working through. We're also exploring the need to ramp up our own efforts in China to bring on inventory.  And also, Ctrip is not our only in a relationship with China. We've got a lot of deep partnerships with various other sources of demand. So we're very bullish. I believe the group is really leading an independent travel outbound from China. I mean, most Chinese do atill travel in packages. But over time, that's going to change, and I think we're in a really nice position in that specific market, which is going to be likely in the next 5 to 10 years, the largest outbound market in the world. And we're making sure that we're serving it, as well as we can."

It's a little bit more difficult at the bottom line, because particularly, online advertising, we're making various assumptions, as to the currencies, that some of the key words would pertain to. What we determined based upon our estimates, is that generally, the impact of the bottom line is similar to what we're quantifying for you at the top line. In Q1, the impact is not as dramatic, because just seasonally, less of our earnings are denominated in euros in Q1. So it's about 14 percentage points at the gross profit line, you can assume it's something less than that at the EBITDA line."

And I think there's probably -- competitors have to match that, if they're going to ultimately get access to availability. We've always believed that any hotel, any partnership have a various sources of demand. We don't cover every customer base in the world. So we would encourage them to use channel managers, have all the sources of demand that they can find. But, of course, we want to fill our fair market share of those rooms. So I don't see anything, specifically, that's coming from that, rather than just probably, a long-overdue balancing, rebalancing of the market, as it relates to take rates.

Yes, at the very highest level, our business is becoming more direct. And that's also allowing us to lean into paid channels more. What we like is the combination of online marketing, as well as our offline marketing. It's helping to build our brands. And we always judge things on the base of earning positive ROI in the transaction. So if I can give positive ROI in the transaction, and there's enough opportunity to do that, we're going to lean into it. That's like fishing, where you're going to fish and then you actually have to work with the customer to make them loyal over the long-term. So that rhythm, in our entire business, is working very well. Obviously, the more direct business you have, at some point, is an end game, where you are completely direct. But often, that obviously, dramatically improve the market economics. But we're not at that time, and we're still very much having the search out more and more customers to bring on to the platform.

And we're a big partner of, in particularly, Google but other search engines and meta-engines. And I feel really good about our mobile web product performs. So I don't think there's a place specifically in our business. We're not a high-frequency thing like a Facebook or a Twitter. So our business is never going to end up being 100% app. And there's always going to be a nice balance between web and app. I should say and a couple of exceptions to that in the portfolio, OpenTable is very happy app, because of the nature of a restaurant reservation. Actually, KAYAK is a very heavy app, because people are always checking fight schedules. It's a much more frequent occurrence than actually, going out and booking a hotel room or renting a rental car.  And that's why mobile web, by the way, performs a lot like a desktop web. It's a different product you're buying, but you're holding to a similar ROI standard and spending as well."

We have a lot of innovations now we're working on to get to the single owner, single property market, which is a whole new market that we have in, as today, we've been addressing as well.

So first of all, the offline, again, this is just the Booking.com statement. The markets we're in right now are U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany and France.

The markets we're in right now are U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany and France. And the way we think about it is -- obviously, we have a lot of micro-data, so we're trying everything we can to measure the effect and unless you're running an ad on this channel versus that channel. And we built a great team that can optimize the way we spend our advertising relative to the bookings, against that advertising. So when you get to the macro level, the goal is to hit in a return an advertising standard that adds both our online spend and our offline spend. And of course, what you want to do is have a high return on that total spend, as you begin spending offline than you did when you only spend online. So you always get a combination of more and more of your business coming direct, but also an improvement in your online spend because people might click on your ad because they have -- last saw you in television when -- they might not click on your ad because they're like, who are these guys?"" And we -- so even measuring that. It usually takes some months to figure out, to a year end, to a positive ROE territory. And with almost every market, so far, we've proven that we can get to positive ROA. Maybe not always in 12 months, but we can ultimately, get to positive ROA. And that's what encourages us. It doesn't mean we can spend offline today, and tomorrow our ROA is higher than it was before, because it doesn't happen that way. That's the big challenge with offline marketing. But more or less, we now have enough experience to know that that macro metric is getting to where want to do it. And that's why we continue to lean in the market. And ultimately, the ROA improves because of the clicking. But again, we're getting more and more direct business. BookingSuite. So the play there, there's 2 sides to it. One is building a SAS business. We're -- this is a Software business. And we think because we already have a sales force in place, which is the toughest thing in a SaaS business of distribution, that's were all the costs go. So we have a sales force in place. So we can have specialists sit as our sales first quarter, so we can go out and talk to many, many hotels everywhere in the world, and have a set of specialists help with that.  But we also already have a lot of hotel content. We have the availability, we have the booking engine, so we can build a hotel side very fast, with almost no variable cost. And that's why the BookingSuite product is basically free, the base product. And then we earn money out of the transaction. And we've done all of our modeling that that'll be a good material business for the group. I don't see it, likely it ever being bigger than our core transaction booking business. But it's a sizable business on its own. The other side of the reason of doing BookingSuite, is helping our partners become more capable with technology. And the more capable they are with technology and keeping their calendars up-to-date, keeping their pricing right, the more able they are to plug-in to our platform. And a third thing, but it really is a third, is that we can do all of this and save our partner's money, and they can then trust us more as a company, that we do more than just building transaction. We're actually make it easier to run a property. That's another benefit. .So it's really threefold, but we're not just doing this to be nice. It's a real business, and we expect in the, let's call it, the medium to longer-term, to have a pretty substantial impact on our overall business."

For us, parity is not a construct of the online market, the online industry. It's  actually the whole travel industry. Like, if you had to go to a site that's sold the Delta Airline ticket, and it was always $10 more, it's hard to be in business. Apple has the same thing. If you go buy a Mac in an Apple Store, and then you go to a third party distributors and it's $10 more, there won't be any third-party distributors. So parity is a very important construct, that levels of playing field, it allows us to really reach our primary objective. Our primary objective is to always make sure that our customers get the best price. Like we can't be in businesses, if our customers feel that they're paying more using any of our assets. So we worked this -- through this compromise, I think it was well understood by the authorities, that there's a free writing problem in a business like ours, if our suppliers, who basically, load their prices on our systems. And load the higher prices on our systems, and lower price on their system. But more importantly, regardless of whether there's parity or not, if the hotel is on our system, and the price are too high, it won't convert. And if it doesn't convert, then it won't show up, because there's a ranking mechanism anyway, that always makes sure that the best product moves at the top. And our best partners have the best product, have a very strong incentive to give our customers good value, because our customers won't buy things that aren't good would value. So there's already a really strong reinforcing element. I don't see this as having any significant impact on our business, but it's a moving target. There's always new discussions and things. But the way that our business runs and the reason customers use our products, they want to have confidence that we're getting the best pricing. And this agreement doesn't, at all, affect our rights or ability to make sure that they get the best price, and that's what's important. And then on the BookingSuite topic, we don't, we don't release right now how many sites we're putting out. Maybe in a few quarters, we'll give everyone an insight into that, but it's off to a very strong start. So it's promising. The team in Seattle, which was Buuteeq, is our back-end team. And we now have sales people out in the field. They're really a second-tier sales force. They're not in every office, but they're there. When a warm lead happens, it gets handed off to somebody who really knows the depth of what they're talking about. We're in the bigger countries. But in the smaller countries, we're just getting to that. Our teams are just getting trained up on that. So it's sort of a rolling motion, but early signs are very, very positive. And the demand for the product, it's extremely strong, which is a good feeling, because it shows our partners trust us, and they recognize that this value proposition is really outstanding for people who have a website in the accommodation arena."

And this is now more of Booking.com, or go to rental car statement. But put aside, KAYAK and OpenTable because of the aforementioned, that they're primarily on app, and they get the sort of the really high repeat frequency type customers, which is a different set of behaviors. But in our business, our most loyal customers is a bit of a circularity, because our most loral loyal customers are the one to carry the app. And our most loyal customers are the ones that bounce overall the screens. So the app, for them, is not just a booking experience, it's the thing that they carry their reservation in. We know how travel guides. So the travel guide is in the app. When they check into a hotel, immediately, it says, ""Are you happy or sad?"" So all of these things come with the app and help our most loyal customers that are often -- the people who book with us already many times, they continue to repeat with us. So it would be a stretch to say that everyone who uses the app is a more loyal customer, because the input to that, generally, is some more loyal.  But we do find generally now, going away from app and talking about mobile more generally. The move -- the biggest thing that's changed in our business is the move from a single screen world, where you only did one thing with us, which was make a booking, to a multiscreen world, where you have an end-to-end experience from looking to booking to enjoying your trip on the ground, is giving us more and more loyalty. So people realize there's lots of reasons to use our products. But when they can actually, make the whole experience better, people see that wow, this is just a better way to do things. And it's hard to make that multiscreen experience all tied together. And we're certainly not complete with that work. But it's a huge differentiator. And for a big player like us, we have the assets and the resources to invest to make that seamless, and for you to be able to do that anywhere you travel in the world. This isn't an easy work, by the way, because all of these softwares don't naturally speak with one another. When you've got to get the right cloud-based architecture, where your account can sit in the cloud, and no a matter if you're on the app, or Booking Now, are you on an AppleWatch, or you're on the website that your account immediately gets tied together. But that's work the team has done, and I think, does reward the bigger players who can really plumb that new sort of end-to-end multiscreen digital experience for our customers. So I'm excited. For e-commerce players, mobile is a real positive. When you're in the media business, mobile has this extra tradeoff, that it's just harder to convert something through media on a smaller screen and that's obviously -- you're seeing that trade-off between those who own the transaction and those who don't."

We don't feel any extra pressure. We -- again, that's always the lands that we have a very low bars as it is around the world, compared to most of our competition, but we don't feel pressure to go lower. When you get into the single vacation home space, we still have generally signed up without having to dilute our take rate much. So there's a little bit more pressure there, because the average vacation home owner, it's a marketplace with a lot of friction and a lot of uncertainty. And we're the first and only transaction engine that works that's instantly verifiable. So our property has actually has a calendar that works. There's no back and forth with the consumer, like once the customer buys, then they have to pay. So there's a lot of work still yet to be done. And a lot of these players are used to marketing themselves through a classified ad or on an Internet website. And they're expecting phone calls, or maybe, if -- some of them may even be on Airbnb. And there's just different economics in that, that I would say that, the story is still out on the vacation home market. But at we've, at least to-date, approach it in a similar way. The other argument of vacation homes is, the length of stay there is a lot longer, the ADR is potentially, higher. And therefore, they would argue that the take rate percentage would be lower, but the absolute take rate is actually very healthy relative to the booking. But sorry, long answer to the question. I don't feel a lot of pressure, but in the vacation home, single-owner market, we, of course, will compete aggressively as we need to, and be smart about the economics."

Agoda has a loyalty program, although we're slowly phasing that out. OpenTable has a points loyalty program. This is in the more traditional earned points, earned nights, get things free. We -- booking.com, specifically, we believe that, that kind of mechanism for the really infrequent traveler, can be as much of a turnoff as a turn-on, because they may only do 2 bookings a year, but they may be want is do 1 booking, and then maybe do it quite infrequently. And for them, what they want, is just to create experience. So we focused -- to drive loyalty we focus very much on the product, and getting them amazing pricing. When you go to a destination, it's not about what this hotel cost, it's about, what is the selection and assortment allow me to buy. And our users love the fact that they could find that place that directly matches what they need at a great value. And that's what's driven our loyalty over time, is really been product experience. That said, Brian, I can tell you, we haven't book 5x on Booking, because if you do within a year, we have a program called Genius, that we offer more of a surprise and delight fashion to our most frequent guests. And that allows them access to other closed user group rates that are supplied by our hotel partners. Our hotel partners are really interested in our most frequent guests, improves their conversion, and therefore, improves their placement on our front-end to all customers. And that's something we've had in the market now going on a couple of years and has been really successful. So that's been our approach to-date. It's not that we won't change that. We're always questioning these things. Rocket Miles, we bought, it's a really interesting small company in Chicago that uses airline miles. That's more -- we're interested in it, because it's a real fast-growing, very unique business. But we're obviously, now bringing in some people with some deep expertise within Rocket Miles. Many of them came from the Airline Frequent Flyer Miles business. And we'll see if we learn anything from that that might impact our thinking differently in the future."

Thank you for joining us for the market's open this morning in New York.  I'm here in Amsterdam with The Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $13.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year or about 26% on a local currency basis. Room nights exceeded 100 million for the first time during the quarter, while growth accelerated slightly to 25%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $8.12, up 4% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $7.72 per share and our guidance for the quarter. 
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were substantially impacted by the stronger dollar.
Our international business recorded 29% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, up from 27% last quarter. Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com, which now has over 640,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 200 countries and territories, up 40% over last year. We are continuing to ramp new property acquisition, including individually owned vacation rentals, with new onboarding tools that allow owners to list their property quickly and easily on our websites. Vacation rentals nearly doubled year-over-year to 275,000 instantly bookable and confirmable properties, including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products. 
Two important innovations were also launched at Booking.com in the first quarter: Booking Now, our mobile phone app for spontaneous bookers; and BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform. Both launches were executed well and early results were encouraging. Each of these growth extensions represent innovation beachheads that will be further expanded upon in the coming weeks, months and quarters. International results also benefited from Agoda.com and rentalcars.com, both of which accelerated in the quarter. 
KAYAK and OpenTable continue to pursue the international opportunity. And while much work has been done and both businesses are growing, there's still a lot of potential ahead of us. KAYAK is focused on product innovation and brand building and has been some solid business progress particularly in Europe. OpenTable has now more or less completed its technical re-platforming to a more modern cloud-based architecture. We are now executing plans to optimize the product and roll it out globally.
Against these plans, we will take a determined but test-and-learn approach over the coming quarters as we have with all our businesses. Demand for OpenTable solutions from both restaurants and customers remains very strong. 
priceline.com's domestic growth continued to be hampered by the shrinking opaque business. priceline.com's retail business remains healthy, including acceleration in the retail hotels, and a new management team there is poised to rejuvenate and maximize the potential of the priceline.com brand.
We also acquired Rocketmiles in the first quarter, an innovative hotel booking platform for frequent flyers based in Chicago. Rocketmiles is being managed independently as part of our Priceline Ventures portfolio. 
Mobile's uninterrupted growth in share of our business continues. From Booking.com's Booking Now app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers to priceline.com's [indiscernible] CHAPS to our Pay with OpenTable moment -- mobile payments app, to KAYAK's mobile itinerary management tools, innovation and execution on mobile is in our DNA and critical to the group's continued success. Across the group, our customers completed over 100 million reservations from their smartphones in the last 12 months, and that number continues to grow very rapidly. 
We believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter, and we're pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our fundamental growth momentum, as measured by units and in constant currency, remains strong. We again delivered strong organic performance on both the top and bottom line, providing substantial earnings to reinvest in profitable growth and share buybacks while maintaining attractive operating margins.
We repurchased $309 million of our common stock during the quarter and have a remaining authorization of $2.8 billion remaining for future quarters. 
I believe it strongly as ever that our formula of out-innovating the competition, smart and sustainable organic growth and earning versus buying our customers' loyalty through best-in-class consumer experiences, end-to-end and across devices, is the winning long-term formula. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. 
I will now turn over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials."
33254,290770601,806805,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015.As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported result",1780,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015.
As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted more dramatically by extreme currency volatility than most companies because about 90% of our full year 2014 gross bookings and operating income were generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 18% and 9%, respectively, for Q1 as compared to the prior year. The euro was also about 2% weaker compared to the rate assumed in our Q1 guidance.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1, Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 than the top line impact.
Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our growth rates expressed in constant currency for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Priceline Group. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in overperformance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line. 
Room nights growth was strong relative to Q4 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 25% in the first quarter, accelerating slightly compared to the 24% growth rate for Q4. Rental car days grew by 18% in Q1, also accelerating compared to Q4 growth of 16%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. 
Q1 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by about 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by about 14% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the results are a mix of solid growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services, which continue to be challenged by a lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 19% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. 
Our international operations generated gross profit $1.4 billion, which grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis and by 15% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $277 million, which represented 38% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q1 of about $61 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 31.1% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q1, which is 448 bps lower than last year. As I said when we gave guidance for the quarter, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects deleverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our booking suite of hotel marketing services. Online advertising also had deleverage due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that benefits revenue in Q2 and Q3 when Easter and summer travel takes place. Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1 when we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality of our business. 
Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to lower-than-forecasted non-advertising OpEx. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $532 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of  $510 million and represents 4% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 3%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 4%. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $209 million of cash from operations during the first quarter 2015, which is about 18% above last year. We invested $31 million in CapEx and repurchased 251,000 shares of our common stock for $309 million in Q1. We expect to execute the remainder of our $3 billion common stock buyback program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
We completed 2 successful financing transactions in Q1 at attractive interest rates. We raised EUR 1 billion for our U.S. parent company by offering a 12-year bond in Europe at a 1.8% interest rate. We also raised $500 million by issuing a 10-year bond in the U.S. investment-grade market with a 3.65%  interest rate. 
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at March 31, 2015, with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q2 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. We're pleased with the resilient unit growth that our business has delivered historically and is inherent in our Q2 forecast. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate for the quarter due to the size of our business.
Our Q2 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 19% for the euro and about 11% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that Q2 represents our toughest year-over-year currency comp for 2015.
For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 15% to 22% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. 
We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. 
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 0 to 7% and gross profit to grow by 17% to 24% on a local currency basis and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q2.
We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit.
Q2 forecast reflects the impact of investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q2 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our booking suite of hotel marketing services. While we are not giving you earnings guidance beyond Q2, we do expect pressure on operating margins from non-advertising OpEx to significantly diminish over the back half of the year as we lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Our Q2 advertising forecast assumes lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising, including rolling out campaigns in new markets. Our approach to advertising spend is consistent with our past approach. We invest in a manner that we believe is sustainable over the long term with the goal of building our brands with consumers. We then strive to win the loyalty of our customers by giving them the most choices and the best booking experience across all devices they use to search and book. This approach has resulted in a nice balance between top and bottom line growth and loyal customers that over time are increasingly coming to us directly rather than through paid channels.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $715 million and $765 million, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 9% versus prior year. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA growth this also impacted by deleverage in operating margins just discussed.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes, an alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. The non-GAAP EPS forecast also reflects the dilutive impact of a full quarter of interest expense from the bond offerings we did in Q1 without any assumed share repurchases we may make using the proceeds.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $10.95 to $11.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 9% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.8 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price. 
We forecast GAAP EPS between $8.85 and $9.65 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter. Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.
We will now take your questions."

And as you know, we have 2 big brands in Asia: Agoda and Booking.com. And together, we have a really strong business. Agoda has traditionally been our business with Southeast Asian bookers, but it's really expanded nicely to include a lot of North Asian bookers and Oceania. At the same time, Booking.com, which started the European business, has had a lot of success expanding into Asia. And really, the real strength of the 2 brands is in Asians moving around Asia. So you have a lot of movement right now between China and Japan, Taiwan and Japan, Korea and Japan. There's a lot of movement also Australians going to Southeast Asia, Southeast Asians also going to North Asia. So we participate then in a lot of the movement within Asia, and both brands continue to grow and have a lot of success. China specifically is an amazing market. We have our relationship with Ctrip. We are constantly meeting the teams. I just got back from China. I met with James and Jane, and it's turning out to be a great partnership. Our outbound business with them is up quite significantly year-over-year. That said, we have more work to do still. We haven't onboarded Ctrip's inventory as fast as I'd hope. There are a lot of issues we're working through. We're also exploring the need to ramp up our own efforts in China to bring on inventory.  And also, Ctrip is not our only in a relationship with China. We've got a lot of deep partnerships with various other sources of demand. So we're very bullish. I believe the group is really leading in independent travel outbound from China. I mean, most Chinese do still travel in packages, but over time that's going to change. And I think we're in a really nice position in that specific market, which is going to be, likely in the next 5 to 10 years, the largest outbound market in the world, and we're making sure that we're serving it as well as we can."

It's a little bit more difficult at the bottom line because particularly the online advertising, we're making various assumptions as to the currencies that some of the key words would pertain to. What we've determined based upon our estimates is that generally, the impact at the bottom line is similar to what we're quantifying for you at the top line. In Q1, the impact is not as dramatic because just seasonally, less of our earnings are denominated in euros in Q1. So it's about 14 percentage points at the gross profit line.

We've always believed that any hotel, any partner should have various sources of demand. We don't cover every customer base in the world [indiscernible], so we would encourage them to use channel managers, who have all the sources of demand that they can find. But of course, we want to still -- the -- our fair market share of those rooms.

It's largely our own execution. I'm actually really proud of the acceleration we're now seeing in rental cars.

Obviously, there's a lot of talk -- if you get somebody on a mobile app, then there is a panacea because then their entry point to the Internet is always through you and it's a very valuable customer. But to get people onto your mobile apps itself is marketing spend. But also, there's a large chunk of business that still happens through mobile web. And we're a big partner of particularly Google but other search engines and meta engines, and I feel really good about how our mobile web product performs. So I don't think there's a place specifically in our business. We're not a high-frequency thing like a Facebook or a Twitter, so our business is never going to end up being a 100% app and there's always going to be a nice balance between web and app. I should say, and a couple of exceptions to that in the portfolio, OpenTable is a very heavy app because of the nature of a restaurant reservation. Actually, KAYAK is a very heavy app because people are always checking fight schedules. It's a much more frequent occurrence than actually going out and booking a hotel room or renting a rental car. And that's why mobile web, by the way, performs a lot like desktop web. It's a different product you're buying, but you're holding it to similar ROI standards and spending as well."

It doesn't mean we can spend offline today and tomorrow our ROA is higher than it was before because it doesn't happen that way [ph]. That's the big challenge with offline marketing. But more or less, we now have enough experience to know that, that macro metric is getting to where want to do it, and that's why we continue to lean in the market. And ultimately, the ROA improves because of the clicking. But again, we're getting more and more direct business. BookingSuite, so the play there, there's 2 sides to it. One is building a SAAS business. We're -- this is a software business, and we think, because we already have a sales force in place, which is the toughest thing in a SaaS business, is distribution, that's where all the costs go. So we have a sales force in place. So we can have specialists sit above our sales force quarter, and we can go out and talk to many, many hotels everywhere in the world and have a set of specialists help with that. But we also already have a lot of the hotel content. We have the availability. We have a booking engine. So we can build a hotel site very fast with almost no variable cost. And that's why the BookingSuite product is basically free, the base product, and then we earn money off the transaction. And we've done all of our modeling that, that'll be a good material business for the group. I don't see it likely ever being bigger than our core transaction booking business, but it's a sizable business on its own. The other side of the reason of doing BookingSuite is helping our partners become more capable with technology. And the more capable they are with technology and keeping their calendars up-to-date and keeping their pricing right, the more able they are to plug into our platform. And a third thing, but it really is the third, is that we can do all of this and save our partners money, and they can then trust us more as a company, that we do more than just building transaction. We actually make it easier to run a property. That's another benefit. So it's really threefold, but it's -- we're not just doing this to be nice. It's a real business and we expect in the, let's call it, the medium to longer term to have a pretty substantial impact on our overall business."

For us, parity was -- is not a construct of the online industry. It's actually the whole travel industry. Like, if you had to go to a site that sold a Delta Air Lines ticket and it'd be always be $10 more, it's hard to be in business. Apple has the same thing. If you go buy a Mac in an Apple Store and then you go to a third-party distributors and it's $10 more, there won't be any third-party distributors. So parity is a very important construct that levels the playing field and allows us to really reach our primary objective. Our primary objective is to always make sure that our customers get the best price. Like, we can't be in businesses if our customers feel like they're paying more using any of our assets. So we worked this -- through this compromise. I think it was well understood by the authorities that there's a free riding problem in a business like ours if our suppliers, who basically load their prices onto our system, can load higher prices on our system and  lower prices on their system. But more importantly, regardless of whether there's parity or not, if a hotel is on our system and the prices are too high, it won't convert. And if it doesn't convert, then it won't show up because there's a ranking mechanism anyway that always makes sure that the best product moves at the top. And our best partners who have the best product have a very strong incentive to give our customers good value because our customers won't buy things that aren't good value. So there's already a really strong reinforcing element. I don't see this as having any significant impact on our business, but it's a moving target. There's always new discussions and things. But the way that our business runs and the reason customers use our products, they want to have confidence that we're getting the best pricing. And this agreement doesn't at all affect our rights or ability to make sure that they get the best price, and that's what's important. And then on the BookingSuite topic, we don't release right now how many sites we're putting out. Maybe in a few quarters, we'll give everyone an insight into that. But it's off to a very strong start, so it's promising. The team in Seattle, which was Buuteeq, is our back-end team. And we now have salespeople out in the field. They're really a second-tier sales force. They're not in every office, but they're there. When a warm lead happens, it gets handed off to somebody who really knows the depth of what they're talking about. We're in the bigger countries. But in the smaller countries, we're just getting to that. Our teams are just getting trained up on that. So it's sort of a rolling motion. But early signs are very, very positive. And the demand for the product, it's extremely strong, which is a good feeling because it shows our partners trust us and they recognize that this value proposition is really outstanding for people who have a website in the accommodation arena."

Yes, what we find is, at least in our business -- and this is a -- this is now more a Booking.com or go to rental car statement. I'll put aside KAYAK and OpenTable because of the aforementioned, that they're primarily on app and they get the sort of the really high repeat frequency-type customers, which is a different set of behaviors. But in our business, our most loyal customers is a bit of a [indiscernible] because our most loyal customers are ones that carry the app. Our most loyal customers are the ones that bounce overall the screens. So the app for them is not just a booking experience, it's the thing that they carry their reservation in. They now have travel guides. So the travel guide is in the app. When they check into a hotel, immediately it says, ""Are you happy or sad?"" So all of these things come with the app and help our most loyal customers that are often the people who've booked with us already many times, continue to repeat with us. So it's -- it would be a stretch to say that everyone who uses the app is a more loyal customer because the input to that generally is they're more loyal. But we do find generally -- now going away from app and talking about mobile more generally, the move -- the biggest thing that's changing our business is the move from a single-screen world, where you only did one thing with us, which was make a booking, to a multiscreen world, where you have an end-to-end experience from looking to booking to enjoying your trip on the ground, is giving us more and more loyalty. If people realize there's lots of reasons to use our products, but when they can actually make the whole experience better, people see that wow, this is just a better way to do things. And it's hard to make that multiscreen experience all tied together and we are certainly not complete with that work, but it's a huge differentiator. And for a big player like us, we have the assets and the resources to invest to make that seamless and for you to be able to do that anywhere you travel in the world. This isn't easy work, by the way, because all of these softwares don't naturally speak with one another and you got to get the right cloud-based architecture, where your account can sit in the cloud. And then no matter if you're on the app or the Booking Now or you on an Apple Watch or you're on the website, your account immediately gets tied together. But that's work the team has done and, I think, does reward the bigger players who can really plumb that new sort of end-to-end multiscreen digital experience for our customers. So I'm excited. For e-commerce players, mobile is a real positive. When you're in the media business, mobile has this extra trade-off, that it's just harder to convert something through media on a smaller screen and that's obvious. So you're seeing that trade-off between those who own the transaction and those who don't."

So first, just commenting on B&Bs and apartments and things like that, we see that the commission levels and the take rates in that space are equivalent to the hotel space. We don't feel any extra pressure. We -- again, that's always the lens that we have a very low bar as it is around the world compared to most of our competition where we don't feel pressure to go lower. When you get into the single vacation home space, we still have generally signed up without having to dilute our take rate much. There's a little bit more pressure there because the average vacation homeowner -- it's a marketplace with a lot of friction and a lot of uncertainty. And we're the first and only transaction engine that works that's instantly verifiable. So our property has actually -- we have a calendar that works. There's no back and forth with the consumer. Like, once the consumer buys, then they have to pay. So there's a lot of work still yet to be done. And a lot of these players are used to marketing themselves through a classified ad or on an Internet website. And they're expecting phone calls or maybe it's -- some of them might even be on Airbnb. And there's just different economics in that, that I would say -- let's say that the story is still out in the vacation home market, but it's -- but we've, at least to date, been able to approach it in a similar way. The other argument of vacation homes is the length of stay is a lot longer, the ADR is potentially higher. And therefore, they would argue that the take rate percentage should be lower, but the absolute take rate is actually very healthy relative to the booking. But -- sorry, long answer to the question. I don't feel a lot of pressure. But in the vacation home single-owner market, we, of course, will compete aggressively as we need to and be smart about the economics."

Agoda has a loyalty program, although we're slowly phasing that out. OpenTable has a points loyalty program. This is in the more traditional earned points, earned nights, get things free. We -- Booking.com specifically, we believe that, that kind of mechanism for the really infrequent traveler can be as much of a turnoff as a turn on because they may only do 2 bookings a year, but they may be wanting do 1 booking and they maybe do it quite infrequently. And for them, what they want is just a great experience. So we focused -- to drive loyalty, we focus very much on the product and getting them amazing pricing. When you go to a destination, it's not about what this hotel package costs, it's about what does the selection and assortment allow me to buy. And our users love the fact that they can find that place that directly matches what they need at a great value. And that's what's driven our loyalty over time, has really been product experience. That said, Brian, I can tell you, having booked 5x on Booking, because if you do within a year, we have a program called Genius that we offer in more of a surprise-and-delight fashion to our most frequent guests. And that allows them access to other close user group rates that are supplied by our hotel partners. Our hotel partners are really interested in our most frequent guests. It improves their conversion and, therefore, improves their placement on our front end to all customers. And that's something we've had in the market now going on a couple of years and has been really successful. So that's been our approach to-date. It's not that we won't change that. We're always questioning these things. Rocketmiles we bought, it's a really interesting small company in Chicago that uses airline miles. It's -- that's more -- we're interested in it because it's a real fast-growing, very unique business. But we're obviously now bringing in some people with some deep expertise within Rocketmiles. Many of them came from the airline frequent flyer miles business, and we'll see if we'll learn anything from that, that might impact our thinking differently in the future."

Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were substantially impacted by the stronger dollar.
Our international business recorded 29% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, up from 27% last quarter. Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com, which now has over 640,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 200 countries and territories, up 40% over last year. We are continuing to ramp new property acquisition, including individually owned vacation rentals, with new onboarding tools that allow owners to list their property quickly and easily on our websites. Vacation rentals nearly doubled year-over-year to 275,000 instantly bookable and confirmable properties, including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products. 
Two important innovations were also launched at Booking.com in the first quarter: Booking Now, our mobile phone app for spontaneous bookers; and BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform. Both launches were executed well and early results were encouraging. Each of these growth extensions represent innovation beachheads that will be further expanded upon in the coming weeks, months and quarters. International results also benefited from Agoda.com and rentalcars.com, both of which accelerated in the quarter. 
KAYAK and OpenTable continue to pursue the international opportunity. And while much work has been done and both businesses are growing, there's still a lot of potential ahead of us. KAYAK is focused on product innovation and brand building and has made some solid business progress particularly in Europe. OpenTable has now more or less completed its technical re-platforming to a more modern cloud-based architecture. We are now executing plans to optimize the product and roll it out globally.
Against these plans, we will take a determined but test-and-learn approach over the coming quarters as we have with all our businesses. Demand for OpenTable solutions from both restaurants and customers remains very strong. 
priceline.com's domestic growth continued to be hampered by the shrinking opaque business. priceline.com's retail business remains healthy, including acceleration in the retail hotels, and a new management team there is poised to rejuvenate and maximize the potential of the priceline.com brand.
We also acquired Rocketmiles in the first quarter, an innovative hotel booking platform for frequent flyers based in Chicago. Rocketmiles is being managed independently as part of our Priceline Ventures portfolio. 
Mobile's uninterrupted growth in share of our business continues. From Booking.com's Booking Now app for spontaneous or last-minute bookers to priceline.com's iWatch app to our Pay with OpenTable moment -- mobile payments app, to KAYAK's mobile itinerary management tools, innovation and execution on mobile is in our DNA and critical to the group's continued success. Across the group, our customers completed over 100 million reservations from their smartphones in the last 12 months, and that number continues to grow very rapidly. 
We believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter, and we're pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our fundamental growth momentum, as measured by units and in constant currency, remains strong. We again delivered strong organic performance on both the top and bottom line, providing substantial earnings to reinvest in profitable growth and share buybacks while maintaining attractive operating margins.
We repurchased $309 million of our common stock during the quarter and have a remaining authorization of $2.8 billion remaining for future quarters. 
I believe it strongly as ever that our formula of out-innovating the competition, smart and sustainable organic growth and earning versus buying our customers' loyalty through best-in-class consumer experiences, end-to-end and across devices, is the winning long-term formula. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. 
I will now turn over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials."
33254,290770601,807011,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015.As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported result",1780,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015.
As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted more dramatically by extreme currency volatility than most companies because about 90% of our full year 2014 gross bookings and operating income were generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 18% and 9%, respectively, for Q1 as compared to the prior year. The euro was also about 2% weaker compared to the rate assumed in our Q1 guidance.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1, Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 than the top line impact.
Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our growth rates expressed in constant currency for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Priceline Group. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in overperformance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line. 
Room night’s growth was strong relative to Q4 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 25% in the first quarter, accelerating slightly compared to the 24% growth rate for Q4. Rental car days grew by 18% in Q1, also accelerating compared to Q4 growth of 16%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. 
Q1 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by about 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by about 14% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the results are a mix of solid growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services, which continue to be challenged by a lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 19% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. 
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion, which grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis and by 15% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $277 million, which represented 38% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q1 of about $61 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 31.1% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q1, which is 448 bps lower than last year. As I said when we gave guidance for the quarter, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects deleverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our booking suite of hotel marketing services. Online advertising also had deleverage due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that benefits revenue in Q2 and Q3 when Easter and summer travel takes place. Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1 when we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality of our business. 
Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to lower-than-forecasted non-advertising OpEx. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $532 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of  $510 million and represents 4% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 3%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 4%. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $209 million of cash from operations during the first quarter 2015, which is about 18% above last year. We invested $31 million in CapEx and repurchased 251,000 shares of our common stock for $309 million in Q1. We expect to execute the remainder of our $3 billion common stock buyback program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital.
We completed 2 successful financing transactions in Q1 at attractive interest rates. We raised EUR 1 billion for our U.S. parent company by offering a 12-year bond in Europe at a 1.8% interest rate. We also raised $500 million by issuing a 10-year bond in the U.S. investment-grade market with a 3.65%  interest rate. 
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at March 31, 2015, with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q2 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. We're pleased with the resilient unit growth that our business has delivered historically and is inherent in our Q2 forecast. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate for the quarter due to the size of our business.
Our Q2 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 19% for the euro and about 11% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that Q2 represents our toughest year-over-year currency comp for 2015.
For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 15% to 22% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0 to 5%. 
We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. 
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 0 to 7% and gross profit to grow by 17% to 24% on a local currency basis and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q2.
We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit.
Q2 forecast reflects the impact of investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q2 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our booking suite of hotel marketing services. While we are not giving earnings guidance beyond Q2, we do expect pressure on operating margins from non-advertising OpEx to significantly diminish over the back half of the year as we lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.
Our Q2 advertising forecast assumes lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising, including rolling out campaigns in new markets. Our approach to advertising spend is consistent with our past approach. We invest in a manner that we believe is sustainable over the long term with the goal of building our brands with consumers. We then strive to win the loyalty of our customers by giving them the most choices and the best booking experience across all devices they use to search and book. This approach has resulted in a nice balance between top and bottom line growth and loyal customers that over time are increasingly coming to us directly rather than through paid channels.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $715 million and $765 million, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 9% versus prior year. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA growth this also impacted by deleverage in operating margins just discussed.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes, an alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. The non-GAAP EPS forecast also reflects the dilutive impact of a full quarter of interest expense from the bond offerings we did in Q1 without any assumed share repurchases we may make using the proceeds.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $10.95 to $11.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a decrease of 9% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.8 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price. 
We forecast GAAP EPS between $8.85 and $9.65 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter. Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.
We will now take your questions."

And as you know, we have 2 big brands in Asia: Agoda and Booking.com. And together, we have a really strong business. Agoda has traditionally been our business with Southeast Asian bookers, but it's really expanded nicely to include a lot of North Asian bookers and Oceania. At the same time, Booking.com, which started the European business, has had a lot of success expanding into Asia. And really, the real strength of the 2 brands is in Asians moving around Asia. So you have a lot of movement right now between China and Japan, Taiwan and Japan, Korea and Japan. There's a lot of movement also Australians going to Southeast Asia, Southeast Asians also going to North Asia. So we participate then in a lot of the movement within Asia, and both brands continue to grow and have a lot of success. China specifically is an amazing market. We have our relationship with Ctrip. We are constantly meeting the teams. I just got back from China. I met with James and Jane, and it's turning out to be a great partnership. Our outbound business with them is up quite significantly year-over-year. That said, we have more work to do still. We haven't onboarded Ctrip's inventory as fast as I'd hope. There are a lot of issues we're working through. We're also exploring the need to ramp up our own efforts in China to bring on inventory.  And also, Ctrip is not our only in a relationship with China. We've got a lot of deep partnerships with various other sources of demand. So we're very bullish. I believe the group is really leading in independent travel outbound from China. I mean, most Chinese do still travel in packages, but over time that's going to change. And I think we're in a really nice position in that specific market, which is going to be, likely in the next 5 to 10 years, the largest outbound market in the world, and we're making sure that we're serving it as well as we can."

It's a little bit more difficult at the bottom line because particularly the online advertising, we're making various assumptions as to the currencies that some of the key words would pertain to. What we've determined based upon our estimates is that generally, the impact at the bottom line is similar to what we're quantifying for you at the top line. In Q1, the impact is not as dramatic because just seasonally, less of our earnings are denominated in euros in Q1. So it's about 14 percentage points at the gross profit line.

And I think there's probably -- competitors have to match that if they're going to ultimately get access to availability. We've always believed that any hotel, any partner should have various sources of demand. We don't cover every customer base in the world et cetera, so we would encourage them to use channel managers, who have all the sources of demand that they can find. But of course, we want to fill -- the -- our fair market share of those rooms. So I don't see anything specifically that's coming from that rather than just probably a long-overdue balancing, a rebalancing of the market as it relates to take rates.

It's largely our own execution. I'm actually really proud of the acceleration we're now seeing in rental cars.

Obviously, the more direct business you have, at some point there's an end game where you are completely direct. But Open, that obviously dramatically improves the marketing economics. But we're not at that time and we're still very much having to search out more and more customers to bring on to the platform. So that's one area. And I don't know, Dan, if you want to make a comment as well on marketing."

Obviously, there's a lot of talk -- if you get somebody on a mobile app, then there is a panacea because then their entry point to the Internet is always through you and it's a very valuable customer. But to get people onto your mobile apps itself is marketing spend. But also, there's a large chunk of business that still happens through mobile web. And we're a big partner of in particularly Google but other search engines and meta engines, and I feel really good about how our mobile web product performs. So I don't think there's a place specifically in our business. We're not a high-frequency thing like a Facebook or a Twitter, so our business is never going to end up being a 100% app and there's always going to be a nice balance between web and app. I should say, and a couple of exceptions to that in the portfolio, OpenTable is a very heavy app because of the nature of a restaurant reservation. Actually, KAYAK is a very heavy app because people are always checking fight schedules. It's a much more frequent occurrence than actually going out and booking a hotel room or renting a rental car. And that's why mobile web, by the way, performs a lot like desktop web. It's a different product you're buying, but you're holding it to similar ROI standards and spending as well."

Maybe each year, we'll talk about that. But I will say it's growing faster than our core business. It is a product that's very demanded by our customer base, and we feel like our tools and our various rhythms are getting better and better at ingesting this kind of stock. We have a lot of innovations now we're working on to get to the single-owner, single-property market, which is a whole new market that we haven't as today been addressing as well. Most of our vacation rental homes are through property management companies, but there's a large segment of market where the homeowner actually manages their home. So really excited about it.

So first of all, in the offline, again, it's just the Booking.com statement. The markets we're in right now are U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany and France.

The markets we're in right now are U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany and France. And the way we think about it is obviously, we have a lot of micro data. So we're trying everything we can to measure the effect on this of running an ad on this channel versus that channel. And we've built a great team that can optimize the way we spend our advertising relative to the bookings we get from that advertising. But then when you go to the macro level, the goal is to hit in a return an advertising standard that adds both our online spend and our offline spend. And of course, what you want to do is have a higher return on that total spend after you begin spending offline than you did when you only spend online. So you always get a combination of more and more of your business coming direct but also an improvement in your online spend because people might click on your ad because they last saw you on television when -- they might not have clicked on your ad because they're like, who are these guys? And we -- so even measuring that. And usually, it takes some months to figure out that you're into a positive ROE territory. And with almost every market so far, we've proven that we can get to positive ROA. Maybe not always in 12 months, but we can ultimately get to positive ROA. And that's what encourages us. It doesn't mean we can spend offline today and tomorrow our ROA is higher than it was before because it doesn't happen that fast. That's the big challenge with offline marketing. But more or less, we now have enough experience to know that, that macro metric is getting to where want to do it, and that's why we continue to lean in the market. And ultimately, the ROA improves because of the clicking. But again, we're getting more and more direct business. BookingSuite, so the play there, there's 2 sides to it. One is building a SAAS business. We're -- this is a software business, and we think, because we already have a sales force in place, which is the toughest thing in a SaaS business, is distribution, that's where all the costs go. So we have a sales force in place. So we can have specialists sit above our sales force quarter, and we can go out and talk to many, many hotels everywhere in the world and have a set of specialists help with that. But we also already have a lot of the hotel content. We have the availability. We have a booking engine. So we can build a hotel site very fast with almost no variable cost. And that's why the BookingSuite product is basically free, the base product, and then we earn money off the transaction. And we've done all of our modeling that, that'll be a good material business for the group. I don't see it likely ever being bigger than our core transaction booking business, but it's a sizable business on its own. The other side of the reason of doing BookingSuite is helping our partners become more capable with technology. And the more capable they are with technology and keeping their calendars up-to-date and keeping their pricing right, the more able they are to plug into our platform. And a third thing, but it really is the third, is that we can do all of this and save our partners money, and they can then trust us more as a company, that we do more than just building transaction. We actually make it easier to run a property. That's another benefit. So it's really threefold, but it's -- we're not just doing this to be nice. It's a real business and we expect in the, let's call it, the medium to longer term to have a pretty substantial impact on our overall business."

For us, parity was -- is not a construct of the online industry. It's actually the whole travel industry. Like, if you had to go to a site that sold a Delta Air Lines ticket and it was always be $10 more, it's hard to be in business. Apple has the same thing. If you go buy a Mac in an Apple Store and then you go to a third-party distributors and it's $10 more, there won't be any third-party distributors. So parity is a very important construct that levels the playing field and allows us to really reach our primary objective. Our primary objective is to always make sure that our customers get the best price. Like, we can't be in businesses if our customers feel like they're paying more using any of our assets. So we worked this -- through this compromise. I think it was well understood by the authorities that there's a free riding problem in a business like ours if our suppliers, who basically load their prices onto our system, can load higher prices on our system and  lower prices on their system. But more importantly, regardless of whether there's parity or not, if a hotel is on our system and the prices are too high, it won't convert. And if it doesn't convert, then it won't show up because there's a ranking mechanism anyway that always makes sure that the best product moves to the top. And our best partners who have the best product have a very strong incentive to give our customers good value because our customers won't buy things that aren't good value. So there's already a really strong reinforcing element. I don't see this as having any significant impact on our business, but it's a moving target. There's always new discussions and things. But the way that our business runs and the reason customers use our products, they want to have confidence that we're getting the best pricing. And this agreement doesn't at all affect our rights or ability to make sure that they get the best price, and that's what's important. And then on the BookingSuite topic, we don't release right now how many sites we're putting out. Maybe in a few quarters, we'll give everyone an insight into that. But it's off to a very strong start, so it's promising. The team in Seattle, which was Buuteeq, is our back-end team. And we now have salespeople out in the field. They're really a second-tier sales force. They're not in every office, but they're there. When a warm lead happens, it gets handed off to somebody who really knows the depth of what they're talking about. We're in the bigger countries. But in the smaller countries, we're just getting to that. Our teams are just getting trained up on that. So it's sort of a rolling motion. But early signs are very, very positive. And the demand for the product, it's extremely strong, which is a good feeling because it shows our partners trust us and they recognize that this value proposition is really outstanding for people who have a website in the accommodation arena."

Yes, what we find is, at least in our business -- and this is a -- this is now more a Booking.com or go to rental car statement. I'll put aside KAYAK and OpenTable because of the aforementioned, that they're primarily on app and they get the sort of the really high repeat frequency-type customers, which is a different set of behaviors. But in our business, our most loyal customers is a bit of a circular argument because our most loyal customers are ones that carry the app. Our most loyal customers are the ones that bounce overall the screens. So the app for them is not just a booking experience, it's the thing that they carry their reservation in. They now have travel guides. So the travel guide is in the app. When they check into a hotel, immediately it says, ""Are you happy or sad?"" So all of these things come with the app and help our most loyal customers that are often the people who've booked with us already many times, continue to repeat with us. So it's -- it would be a stretch to say that everyone who uses the app is a more loyal customer because the input to that generally is they're more loyal. But we do find generally -- now going away from app and talking about mobile more generally, the move -- the biggest thing that's changing our business is the move from a single-screen world, where you only did one thing with us, which was make a booking, to a multiscreen world, where you have an end-to-end experience from looking to booking to enjoying your trip on the ground, is giving us more and more loyalty. If people realize there's lots of reasons to use our products, but when they can actually make the whole experience better, people see that wow, this is just a better way to do things. And it's hard to make that multiscreen experience all tie together and we are certainly not complete with that work, but it's a huge differentiator. And for a big player like us, we have the assets and the resources to invest to make that seamless and for you to be able to do that anywhere you travel in the world. This isn't easy work, by the way, because all of these softwares don't naturally speak with one another and you got to get the right cloud-based architecture, where your account can sit in the cloud. And then no matter if you're on the app or the Booking Now or you on an Apple Watch or you're on the website, your account immediately gets tied together. But that's work the team has done and, I think, does reward the bigger players who can really plumb that new sort of end-to-end multiscreen digital experience for our customers. So I'm excited. For e-commerce players, mobile is a real positive. When you're in the media business, mobile has this extra trade-off that it's just harder to convert something through media on a smaller screen and that's obvious. So you're seeing that trade-off between those who own the transaction and those who don't."

So first, just commenting on B&Bs and apartments and things like that, we see that the commission levels and the take rates in that space are equivalent to the hotel space. We don't feel any extra pressure. We -- again, that's always the lens that we have a very low bar as it is around the world compared to most of our competition where we don't feel pressure to go lower. When you get into the single vacation home space, we still have generally signed up without having to dilute our take rate much. There's a little bit more pressure there because the average vacation homeowner -- it's a marketplace with a lot of friction and a lot of uncertainty. And we're the first and only transaction engine that works that's instantly verifiable. So our property has actually -- we have a calendar that works. There's no back and forth with the consumer. Like, once the consumer buys, then they have to pay. So there's a lot of work still yet to be done. And a lot of these players are used to marketing themselves through a classified ad or on an Internet website. And they're expecting phone calls or maybe it's -- some of them might even be on our B&B. And there's just different economics in that, that I would say -- let's say that the story is still out in the vacation home market, but it's -- but we've, at least to date, been able to approach it in a similar way. The other argument of vacation homes is the length of stay is a lot longer, the ADR is potentially higher. And therefore, they would argue that the take rate percentage should be lower, but the absolute take rate is actually very healthy relative to the booking. But -- sorry, long answer to the question. I don't feel a lot of pressure. But in the vacation home single-owner market, we, of course, will compete aggressively as we need to and be smart about the economics."

Or is there something else going on that we should make sure we consider in our 2Q modeling? And then a higher level one. As you talk about strategies to drive more direct business, any thoughts about offering a broader loyalty program for Booking.com? Or how do you think about a loyalty programming at this point?"

We had a strong quarter with accelerating growth. And to not insignificant degree, those checkouts are going to occur in Q2 around Easter and then Q3 around summer. And the other factor is, as I mentioned before, OpenTable has a more dramatic inorganic benefit to Q1 because the travel businesses are just seasonally smaller in that quarter. And so that's gross profit. It's in our numbers with no room nights associated with it."

Agoda has a loyalty program, although we're slowly phasing that out. OpenTable has a point’s loyalty program. This is in the more traditional earned points, earned nights, get things free. We -- Booking.com specifically, we believe that, that kind of mechanism for the really infrequent traveler can be as much of a turnoff as a turn on because they may only do 2 bookings a year, but they may be wanting do 1 booking and they maybe do it quite infrequently. And for them, what they want is just a great experience. So we focused -- to drive loyalty, we focus very much on the product and getting them amazing pricing. When you go to a destination, it's not about what this hotel package costs, it's about what does the selection and assortment allow me to buy. And our users love the fact that they can find that place that directly matches what they need at a great value. And that's what's driven our loyalty over time, has really been product experience. That said, Brian, I can tell you, having booked 5x on Booking, because if you do within a year, we have a program called Genius that we offer in more of a surprise-and-delight fashion to our most frequent guests. And that allows them access to other close user group rates that are supplied by our hotel partners. Our hotel partners are really interested in our most frequent guests. It improves their conversion and, therefore, improves their placement on our front end to all customers. And that's something we've had in the market now going on a couple of years and has been really successful. So that's been our approach to-date. It's not that we won't change that. We're always questioning these things. Rocketmiles we bought, it's a really interesting small company in Chicago that uses airline miles. It's -- that's more -- we're interested in it because it's a real fast-growing, very unique business. But we're obviously now bringing in some people with some deep expertise within Rocketmiles. Many of them came from the airline frequent flyer miles business, and we'll see if we'll learn anything from that, that might impact our thinking differently in the future."

The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $15 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis, or about 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked the accommodation reservations for 113 million room nights in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting slight acceleration for the second consecutive quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $12.45, down slightly versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.85 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again, impacted substantially by the strong dollar. Our International business recorded 30% gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis, up from 29% last quarter. Booking.com continues to benefit from further penetration of its existing partner relationships, as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has about 707,000 hotels and other accommodations, and 220 countries and territories, up 35% over last year, including 313,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties.
Vacation rental properties grew 62% year-over-year, and now represent 1.7 million rentable units within these properties. In the last 12 months, the most 50 [ph] million room nights for vacation rental properties were booked on Booking.com and villas.com, up 39% year-over-year. This quarter, we began experimenting with self on-boarding of individually-owned vacation rentals properties, subject, of course, to set of quality checks on our side, and the ability of the property to be instantly bookable.
We already have an encouraging pipeline in of vacation rental properties to activate via this channel. And we're hopeful that this functionality will help us scalar property acquisitions even further.
BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform, is off to an impressive start, and continues to exceed our expectations, with the strong demand in streamline execution by our teams. We also added to our BookingSuite offering in Q2 with the acquisition of PriceMatch, a simple cloud-based tool that uses big data to our partners improve their properties' production to enhanced revenue management.
International results also benefited from Agoda.com and rentalcars.com. Agoda delivered a solid quarter consistent with Q1, with special attention to the question of private sales deals that logged in customers. Strong momentum continued at rentalcars.com, which accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row, furthering its lead stover's largest dedicated site for multi-supplier rental car reservation.
Priceline.com continues to be a tale of two cities, with strong regional performance, offset by its shrinking, but still large Name Your Own Price business. The priceline.com management team is making targeted investments, as part of its plan to drive innovation into its business, and to solidify its position as the best site for travel deal in North America.  There's a new level of energy at the company, and we expect great things in the coming quarters.
KAYAK delivered an exceptional bottom line performance in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations, will OpenTable continue to produce double-digit domestic diner growth. After some amount of work to transition its underlying B2B and B2C infrastructure, it's on track to begin launching new international markets later this year.
We took some steps in the quarter to further expand our growth in Latin America. Booking.com launched a TV advertising campaign in Brazil while the group invested $60 million in a minority stake in Hotel Urbano, one of Brazil's largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. Our investment includes an exclusive commercial partnership, whereby, we will provide a Hotel Orbano customers access to the combinations outside of Latin America. 
Finally, and importantly, it's worth commenting on mobile. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this trend. Today is a group, about 1 of 3 buckets of hotels, rental cars and restaurants, happens on a mobile device. At current run rate, this will be more than half of our business in only 2 to 3 years. On a Sunday, in just a week back, we completed a 300,000 transactions, gross of cancellations on mobile at Booking.com for the first time. All of our brands are investing heavily in making our products relevant to consumers across all their screens in a connected fashion, and in ways that are industry-leading.
Since the end of Q1, we repurchased about $1.35 billion of our common stock, and have an authorization of $1.4 billion remaining for the future quarters.
The group performed well in the second quarter on both the top and bottom line. We'll continue Booking.com's successful foray into brand advertising in certain international markets, and investors aggressively in online global channels to profitably build our booking business for the seasonally strong third quarter. We remain committed to striking the right balance between top line growth and bottom line profitability, and you will see, in particular, more stability in non-advertising OpEx percentage, in the second half as we anniversary the OpenTable and BookingSuite investment.
We believe we are making the smart and sustainable investments today that will extend our lead as the world's largest online travel business for years to come. We'll also delivering healthy returns for our shareholders today.
I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.  I will now turn it over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials."
33254,306770205,849018,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported res",1952,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.
We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted by extreme currency volatility, because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 19% and 9%, respectively, for Q2, as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact, were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar in Q2 relative to last year.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q2, Q3 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
The Priceline Group performed well through all of these key metrics in Q2. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in overperformance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line.
Room night growth was strong in Q2 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 26% in the second quarter, accelerating slightly compared to 25% growth rate for Q1. Rental car days grew by 20% in Q2, also accelerating compared to Q1 growth of 18%. Average daily rate for accommodations, or ADRs for Q2 2015, were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group.
ADR trend expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I just discussed.
While we are the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, our growth expressed in constant currency, gives a truer picture of our fundamental business performance. It is more in line with what you would expect based upon our strong unit growth and constant currency ADRs growth.
Specifically, our Q2 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 11% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis, and by only about 12% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business grew by 1%. 
Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower airfares impacted retail air gross bookings growth, but have no impact on gross profit.
Gross profit for the quarter was $2.1 billion, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis, and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.8 billion, which grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis, and by 8% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $303 million, which represented 32% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q2 of about $62 [ph] million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 37.3% of gross profit for Q2, which is 469 bps lower than last year. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to lower ROIs, and gross bookings acceleration that partly benefits revenue in Q3 when summer travel takes place. 
In addition, as we've highlighted over recent quarters, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of our core travel business to handle future growth. Q2 will also reflect the leverage from the inclusion of OpEx for our OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services, which are currently in investment mode as we invest to plant seeds for future growth.
Operating margins were, however, better than our guidance due mainly to lower-than-forecasted non-advertising OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $805 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $765 million, and represents a 1% decrease versus prior year, reflecting the significant foreign currency translation impact with the stronger U.S. dollar.
Non-GAAP net income decreased by 2%, and non-GAAP EPS decreased by 1%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings of the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $702 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2015, which is about 2% above last year, and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $53 million in CapEx, and repurchased it 720,000 shares of our common stock for $849 million in Q2. Thus far in Q3, we repurchased an additional 436,000 shares for $500 million.
We expect to execute the remaining $1.4 billion of our $3 billion common stock buyback authorization at a pace that makes us, and based upon the price of the which our stock is trading available cash in the U.S. and potential uses for other -- other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at June 30, 2015, with about $1.9 billion of that balance in the U.S.
During Q2, we entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility is a 5-year term, and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost. 
Now for Q3 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our room night growth has been remarkably resilient, ranging between 24% to 27% over the last 4 quarters. Our guidance reflects another strong quarter of growth, but assumes that our growth rates will decelerate, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends.
Our Q3 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.09 [ph] per euro and $1.56 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 18% for the euro, and about 7% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. 
I highlight that the euro exchange rate is worse than the $1.12, that prevailed when we last recorded and most analysts updated the forecasts. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and the remainder of the year.  Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comes will become less challenging after Q3.
For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant currency basis, and by minus 1% to positive 6% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with the prior year.  We expect international gross bookings to grow by 16% to 23% on a constant currency basis, and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior-year period.  We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%, we expect gross profit to grow by 19% to 26% on a constant currency basis, and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. 
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q3.  We expect about 160 bps of de-leverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, which is a nice improvement from the margin pressure we have seen in the last couple of quarters.  The de-leverage is mainly attributable to assumed continued pressure for online advertising ROIs, but to a lesser extent than we saw in Q2.
As we indicated on the last couple of earnings calls, margin pressure from non-advertising OpEx diminishes significantly in Q3, and we expect that trend to improve further in Q4. Over the longer term, we expect that our non-advertising OpEx will generally grow more slowly than our gross profit, and we have source of operating leverage.
Our forecast implies a 52% operating margin for Q3. The strong operating margins for our business relative to our competitors positions us well to succeed over the long term in a very competitive market. 
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.425 billion and $1.525 billion, which at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes, and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. 
We are targeting non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS of approximately $22.95 to $24.45 per share, which at the midpoint, is an increase of 7% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of about $1.7 billion of share repurchases we have made, thus far, this year.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.84 and $20 -- $22.34 oer share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar, between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping matter. Darren mentioned the Booking.com's platform now has over 770,000 hotels and other accommodations, including 313,000 vacation rental properties. In September, we intend to adjust our methodology for reporting property counts, to include properties that are contracted with Booking.com but are not currently available to be booked on our side. 
For example, we will now include properties in our account that are temporarily unavailable on our site, because we fill all the rooms alloted to us, or the property is closed seasonally or for renovations. Under the new methodology, we would've reported about 767,000 properties, including about 353,000 vacation rentals. Our prior-year property count on a consistent basis, is about 549,000 properties, including about 206,000 vacation rentals. We believe this change will remove volatility from our property count reporting, and will reflect the more consistent count of our total active partner relationships throughout the year. This is a small but important adjustment, as we continue to add more and more of a long tail and sometimes, seasonal business.

So I think it's a point on mobile to do this thing -- obviously, there's web-based mobile and there app-based mobile. And web-based mobile, still largely, and traditionally through Google and other search engine. And I have to give Google a lot of credit, that's working better and better for us, where our web-based mobile is highly converting, big-based transactions for us. And then in the hotel space, transactions are relatively infrequent, so a pretty significant percentage happen on web-based, particularly customers we've never seen before. Our app-based customers tend to be our more loyal customers. And the place that we built those is mostly from our own property sites. We do go out and buy app downloads, although app downloads don't tend to be very economic, because they often get downloaded and then not ultimately used, at least from that space. So this is basically, is the world of accommodation. It's very different for KAYAK and OpenTable, primarily because both of those businesses are a much higher frequency business. They're very heavily skewed to app. And the whole business of getting people to use the KAYAK app to check for flights or OpenTable to book restaurant, is another dynamic. And both of those businesses focus, heavier and can find their economics, and actually getting downloads, and building lifetime value to customers that are app-based. And those app-based downloads -- there's a little bit of that that comes from Google, but a lot has come from new places, like Facebook and other partners. On Facebook, specifically, we -- we've been generating most of our demand from basically research or travel. And travel includes everything from TripAdvisor, down to easyJet, and airlines and trains and other things. So we've always dreamed of a time, where we could access demand from any of these big horizontal audiences. Facebook is obviously one, Twitter is another. You can think of WeChat or any of these other things -- so just being -- or even the big portals, Yahoo!, MSN, those places. But we've always struggled. And I was quite skeptical, but I have to give Facebook a ton of credit. We're finally getting some good business out of Facebook. Most of it is remarketing or remessaging. And we've now talked with senior management at Facebook, about how do we get intent [ph] out of their network. And that's an area that both us and them, are focused on, into a degree crack the code on intent, would make Facebook a real real serious source of demand for us as a business. And obviously, as a performance marketer, that will be a big deal for Facebook as well. So I'm excited the progress we're making. They, they're investing a lot of time, energy into it, too, which I appreciate. And hopefully, by cracking another source of demand, it allows us to also -- to diversify where we spend our money to find hotel customers."

Well, first of all, we started out as being a hotel-only site, but it's been some years now that we've built out other forms of multiroom accommodations. And even in our old -- in the old Booking.com model, even said hotel reservations was their subsegment-tag. But starting even 4, 5 years ago, we started adding B&Bs, and we even have treehouses and igloos and stationary boats. And basically, other things that you could book. So for us, we went from being the world's largest online hotel player, to now, being the world's largest player in online accommodation. So moving into vacation rentals is a very natural thing for us. It's kind of going down the pyramid, and ultimately, getting into this self-catered product. And for us, we're building it out in an instantly bookable, verifiable way, which is very different than what say, a HomeAway or an Airbnb is doing. We've also focused a lot on making sure the customer experience didn't have all the friction. If you can think of booking a vacation home, and having put down a deposit, and having multiple e-mail exchanges, and not really knowing you've got the property, and not really having the trust. We're doing in a much more kind of a pure e-commerce way. Just trying to create it ultimately, like booking a hotel. And through that strategy, we've had obviously, take a lot of friction of that in the industry, and change the way that players think about that. And it's a lot of work because for a vacation rental owner, you've got to maintain additional calendar. You can't overbook people. When you say the place is available at a certain price, it has to sell at their price. But slowly, we're seeing the ice start to crack a little bit, and starting to see a real momentum. And this is a -- this is great news for vacation rental owners, because this market has a lot of demand and a lot of people -- really think of vacation rentals as an upgrade, like if you've got a family or your group. And you're say, going into Barcelona instead of getting like, 4 hotel rooms, you can get a vacation home on the beach. And you can make your own meals instead of going out to restaurants every night. So this is a very important addition to our business, but there's a lot more work to do. We do have some cooperation with HomeAway, but it's not near the extent that maybe, some of our competitors. And we're still talking there. We have a fairly high bar. We don't do on-request bookings. And for us, it has to be truly instant. It can't be ""Okay, I'll let you know in 24 hours."" That can't be counted instant. And that's just part of the issue -- just keeping a very high bar, and keeping our product very pure, so that it fits with our traditional book or base. And so far, so good, and I -- and we're only going to do more of it. There was a really a jump into a segment. It was more of an evolution down the accommodation pyramid, into the sort of the bottom of the pyramid, which are clearly millions and millions of single-owner property around the world booked in cities, on beaches, at ski resorts, et cetera. So that's the story there."

I mean, it's an amazing business, but it's become less of a percent of our business over time. So we've been working with them across our entire business. Of course, always first, focused on core search. What are the other things we can do to innovate, to get more out of core search. And we've seen some benefit, particularly, in mobile web, where we work together to try to get more out of a mobile web, and that's been, I think very successful. And we're also working with the YouTube team, and we're also doing a lot of work on retargeting. So Google, kind of sees us as one of their biggest advertisers in the world. And we're a very technically performance-driven people. So we were closer together to try to get more out of all the various Google engines. Very specifically, hotel price ads is Google's priced product. We don't love it because we would rather by BlueLinx. We don't need all the extra lifting. But we do understand. And we have worked a lot with the HBA team to make that a better product. I think when it started out, there were a lot of savings and things shown on HBA. They just weren't real savings. Generally, in there's a lot of challenges which showing customers things that they're saving, when the large majority of the time, they're not. It's exchange rates, people don't put taxes on et cetera. It's a real -- it's not the prettiest space. So we were tied with them to improve their product. And then recently, as you've mentioned, they've launched an instant book product. It's still very early on. We don't love instant book products either, because we have a really good process of taking cold customers, and turn them into paying customers. So anyone who creates a path would end up becoming a lower common denominator, because we think we have one of the best booking pass. We have an agency model -- we don't even need the credit card in many cases to do bookings. So we're working also with Google on that, not standing away from and saying, ""Hey, is there a way to make this work?"" -- for our businesses as well as what you're trying to achieve. So it's always been a close-open collaboration, but as I always say, we're going to put our money where its strategic. We're going to watch it really closely. And we have lots of options on where -- to spend out money, we look to continue to create more options to find hotel demand in the future."

You have to go across our brands, but we never reveal the exact percentages. But we have a very healthy repeat business. And I would say, across all of our brands, every single brand, a repeat business every year, gets stronger and stronger. A lot of that is related to the new multiscreen environment. A lot of that is related to -- we do a lot more business with signed in account. In the early days, when it was a singlescreen, you would do transactional business. And every time you book a hotel or a flight, you have to re-enter all your information. But once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name, and at least, to like 1-click booking. And as we've gone into a multiscreen environment, that advantage for an account holder goes up dramatically. If you've ever tried to book an airline ticket on a mobile phone and not have an account, you know what I'm talking about, it's not a pleasant experience. But once you have an account, we can fill the forms, so we can facilitate that. And then you can take your confirmation that maybe, you booked on your tablet, and you can show up at the rental counter with the confirmation on your phone. These are all positives that have driven to more increased repeat business and loyalty among our customers. And then our challenge becomes really and has been how do we bring more customers into the franchise, and that's what we used paid marketing for. But generally speaking, our direct business continues to increase, which gives a reflection generally, of repeat business."

So first of all, in the second quarter, Europe has been very strong. The Eurozone and Southern Europe was a little bit of the ripple of the Grexit, in the coming back of Greece. But generally, Europe has been very solid this year. U.S. is strong for U.S. travelers, and China inbound. But generally, almost everyone else is a little -- going a little less in the U.S. because of the currency effect. And yes, China outbound have -- continues to be very strong for us, growing at very fast rate. Japan inbound, Taiwan inbound, very strong. Korean inbound, not so strong because of MERS, not something that gets a to talk a lot in the United States, it was a real overhang for us. But on the other hand, we had positive comps. Southeast Asia was a much calmer place in Q2 than it was last  Q2. If you remember the Malaysian Air crisis, the coup in Thailand, the burning of factories in Vietnam, there are all sorts of things going on, but that's been a positive from a comp basis. And so that's some quarterly commentary, geographically. But specifically, strategically, Latin America, we entered Latin America -- it start with the Booking.com ramp a number of years ago, starting in Argentina, moving to Brazil. I would say, this is a year where we've really had a breakthrough in Latin America. And we launched our TV ad in Brazil. But really, despite the fact that Latin America is not in the greatest economic health right now, and the 2 big engines, which is Argentina, and most specifically, Brazil, with all kinds of issues, but this is any year where we've really gotten great traction in market, maybe passed the tipping point. We have offices now across the regions, and that's a real positive. And I think if you go to Latin America now, our Asian brand awareness is quite high. Hotel Urbano, specifically, this is a -- it's actually a site that gets a tremendous amount of traffic but still, it's a bit challenged in converting that traffic. But it has a great management team. We've always been excited about the volume of audience that they have. It's largely built through social channels. And you can think of this as kind of a mini feature investments I mean, we've made an investment in the company, but it was really all fit to unlock the commercial opportunity. We're like, ""Where can we help these guys win?"" -- thus, participate a little bit in that upside. But the commercial opportunity is -- I wouldn't say, it's a make or break for Latin America, but it's a good-sized piece of business that will help bring the Latin American outbound travelers to the Rest of the World. I think it also -- it's a reflection of the strength of our portfolio. It's so global that these matchup should make so much sense, because the product converts well. It's a great product. It's all translated, and we can take an audience like this, help the Hotel Urbano monetize, but also, create a great commercial opportunity for us as well."

And that's really our push on the paid advertising side. The thing that we go out a little bit on a limb in is our brand marketing. We now know that we can get a pretty good return on our brand marketing, but it may not happen immediately. But we've shown and overtime, in the markets we've been in for a while, that we can get a better return on our advertising when you add the brand marketing to our performance marketing, send the return we got on our performance marketing alone. And we've done a bunch to build it -- it's the whole bunch of data-driven tools to help us with our media mix. And that's helped us be smarter and data-driven about where and how we spend our brand marketing dollars. So we're building over -- whatever, now it's been a couple of years, some more and more confidence in our ability to appropriately spend our brand marketing dollars, which obviously, is a big growth potential for the company. I mean, Booking.com is not a household name. If you go to America, you'd mentioned OpenTable and KAYAK and Priceline before you'd mentioned Booking. And the ability for us to build the brand and have great performance marketing is still growth potential that's not ahead of us. And we've been working hard and methodically --methodically attack that. I would, our growth is truly sustainable growth because the trademark and we're spending is earning us profit. And all the direct business we're coming is earning us, of course, even more profit. So I don't feel like -- as opposed to some geographies, we have positive unit economics on every single transaction. And we've looked to improve that. And any incremental that were making and marketing, generally comes with positive EBITDA. So -- and we're always trying to get as far as we can to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow for our customers. But we're not worrying about the percentage of our P&L that gets taken up by marketing. And that's been our general philosophy. Some people may say, ""Well, if you're that far, why don't you go a little bit further?"" And that's always the balance that we're striking on what business do we bring, and do we really, truly understand the economics.

And always, the question is, is your advertiser trying to be an OTA? And it's the most extreme, being an OTA is really hard work, like 3/4 of our people are in customer service. They're in the field, they're working property by property on pricing and on availability, and it's a business you have to do at scale. And most of them are media partners, make a lot of money out of. At TripAdvisor, we spend more than $1 million a day. So we have to find a place to spend our money. And we, of course, don't want to spend it with somebody who's planning on being an OTA. I don't believe that's really what TripAdvisor is try to do, but we have to make sure that whatever business we participate in, is a good business. And it's a business that we can ultimately, pay for that will repeat on our platform. So that's why there's a lot of discussion in this area. There's not like a big rainbow for anyone that's in the media business on the other side, because they get most of the economics for the transaction anyways. It's not like suddenly, this whole bunch more money there. In fact, all there is, is just a lot more costs. If you have to think of -- I could show you my inbox someday at some of the escalations I get of the dirty ocean in Cabo, beat the person who wants a refund, or the flying ant and -- these are -- the OTA business sounds very sexy, but in fact, there's a lot of manual work. And that's why there's only a few players who do this work, and do it at scale. And by the way, I saw Ctrip have been there as well. That's why they do it so well. They're got over 10,000 customer service agents to deal with this kind of stuff everyday. So we're being good partners. We're leaning in. I frankly, think that instant book path, ultimately, will prove to be cannibalistic. They may help a little bit on mobile, but that's all to be seen. So we're trying to be positive partners in the process, and trying to make sure that if that's the way our advertising partners are going, that we can design a path that is a good option for us, and where we can get good business off of it."

And then there's an issue, of course, of ""Can you -- do you have the force through your brand?"" By having a stronger brand, you get more loyal customers who then therefore, go more app-based mobile versus web-based mobile. To me, at the highest level, I think of mobile as a huge positive for a company like ours. For many of our partners, it's tough enough to build a great website. They actually have a multiscreen experience that works within account, it's a very difficult thing to do. So that's why I think net is a positive. I don't think it necessarily drives a lot of incremental business for us, and a little bit, may be more last-minute. But it's really a shifting, in the way that people engage with digital assets. I -- I'm sure marketing mix will change relative to mobile. I talked previously that more and more business are coming direct. It's a bit of a chicken and egg. Some of that may be because our mobile business tends to be more direct than our PC-based web business. But again, I think it's all 1 customer, and it's all related to the fact that people are living multiscreen lifestyles versus singlescreen lifestyles, which I think, is a net benefit to us. And ultimately, I think it also leads to more direct account-driven traffic, versus purely off of the web transactional traffic. I think the -- I would I guess, the last thing I would say -- and you certainly see this in China, the impact of mobile, and how like Ctrip buys their demand. And we've learned so much from that relationship, and I always appreciate all the time we get with James and Jane. But it's amazing how they just buy traffic differently. There are a whole market places for apps. In China that exists, that don't exist in the Western world. And how they build that up is -- it's quite fascinating and amazing. And I think there's a lot of lessons for us to learn as this environment changes. But yes, most -- today, again, as I said before, most of our app downloads are from our own properties, which means, it would have to find that some other way. Like in the past, the more and more than you in a sticky way, obviously, that's great business for us, because it's always coming direct by definition, and it's very profitable."

And in terms of the vacation rentals, incremental or not, our general voice is -- first well, it's 1 customer, and either a customer is just a consumer or their business person and a consumer, and they take a number of trips every year. And every trip has a different rationale. And if somebody gives a hotel book around 3 other trips, they may be on a trip with their family and become a vacation rental booker. We want to be able to provide all of those instances, and all of those scenarios through Booking.com so they become comfortable with that. Rather than in the past, I need a hotel, I go to Booking. And if I need a vacation rental, I go to company XYZ. The markets have traditionally been very different because of the nature of the markets were very different. But more and more overtime -- and I think we're partly shipping that, and I believe that ultimately going to be the outcome, the market gets a little mixed, because a person says, ""Hey, I'm going to Barcelona or I'm going to Rio de Janeiro, and I need to find a place to stay."" It's a very common question there -- is where am I going to stay. And relative to that scenario, we want to provide them an option. And that option -- by having more optionality in that, you can drive incrementality, because the person may not find find the right thing on a site that has a more narrow set of options. But on our broad set of options, maybe, they have a certain price range in the certain thing they're looking, we'll be able to satisfy that. Or, in a market like San Francisco or New York, if ADRs and hotels are really high, even business person ends up in an apartment. Or, if you got a big event on, like the World Cup or the Olympics, where everything gets sold out, having all this incremental supply, it offers more that the people can complete them. So I think about it today -- if today's market, is very different between the vacation rental buyer and the hotel buyer, overtime, that'll only coalesce to become more a similar market. Because all it is, is human beings looking for a place to stay. And I think that it's generally -- that's generally the case that we're seeing on our site. Now certainly, vacation rentals face are generally, bigger groups, they're generally, longer length of stay, slightly higher ADR, relative to good take rate. It's always fundamentals, they reflect the market of today. But I do believe that those things are continuing to change and I think it just like B&Bs, used to be a very different thing than hotels, I think over time, accommodations will become more similar than less similar, because it's the same customer."

In terms of take rates, just with, what we believe to be one of the lowest cost of distribution alternatives for our accommodation partners. We feel like that's stable for the long run. And then in terms of advertising, we talked about -- off-line advertising over the long run, we should see stable to margin leverage there. As we end up spending in the markets we want to spend at the levels we want to spend, we could see pressure from a time to time as we enter new market or we increase our spending in the market. But over the long run, we should have leverage there. The online advertising is a big variable, it's very hard to predict. But the OpEx is much more under our control. And we've had a good track record there over many years. So we feel comfortable that over the long term, we can have operating leverage in that line item. For Q3 and Q4, it is largely that we're lapping the acquisition of OpenTable and the acquisitions we made in the BookingSuite area. But as we've seen from time to time in the past, we have some lumpiness in the investments that we make in the core business. So in the early part of the year, we typically ramp up our customer service teams, our hotel teams, to get ready for peak travel season, and then we see leverage in that line item. Over the long run, I think we'll continue to see leverage there."

Thanks, Kevin. So the highest level, I think, for those who follow this, we worked with the competition authorities in France, Sweden and Italy, a kindred agreement on what we call A Narrow MSM, which basically, allows us to keep parity with the hotel's website. And Expedia's also agreed to that. We've had a number of countries come out formally, Austria, Denmark, the same agree, as many others, informally have dropped their cases against us. We've got 1 challenge in France a lot of banning parity, which we weren't consulted on or anything, but we'll come in the SEC, we -- of course, we follow the law. But I think the basic bottom line to understand in this whole discussion, we will never charge our customers more. You can say it clearer, we will never charge our customers more. So we will adjust to whatever environment it is, and we'll make sure that we get the best pricing for our customer. And in some case, we have so much innovation we could do, to make sure our customers don't get shown prices that are uncompetitive. And that -- I don't believe the new law in France is good for consumers. I don't think it's good for the French tourism. I don't think it's good for small properties in France. I actually think it's quite negative, but it is what it is, and we will adjust our model. And our business in France is really strong, both from a booker's standpoint, as well as bookings coming into France. So if doesn't concern me too much, other than just a lot of time invested in this -- this whole area. And I strongly believe -- I mean, parity was an invention of the hotel industry. So I strongly believe it's a good way that all travel should be sold on a basis where customers don't spend too much time searching. And that they decide which channel from an agnostic standpoint, that they want to buy through. But we're more than ready to compete under any set of standards, and hope that the Narrow MSN will be accepted more broadly across Europe."

Thank you for joining us before the markets opened this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $15 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 113 million room nights in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting slight acceleration for the second consecutive quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $12.45, down slightly versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.85 per share and our guidance for the quarter.  
Our u.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were, again, impacted substantially by the strong dollar. 
Our International business recorded 30% gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis, up from 29% last quarter. Booking.com continues to benefit from further penetration of its existing partner relationships as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has about 707,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 35% over last year, including 313,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties.
Vacation rental properties grew 62% year-over-year, and now represent 1.7 million rentable units within these properties. In the last 12 months, about most 50 million room nights for vacation rental properties were booked on Booking.com and Villas.com, up 39% year-over-year. This quarter, we began experimenting with self on-boarding of individually owned vacation rental properties, subject, of course, to a set of quality checks on our side and the ability of the property to be instantly bookable.
We already have an encouraging pipeline of vacation rental properties to activate via this channel, and we're hopeful that this functionality will help us scale our property acquisition even further.
BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform, is off to an impressive start and continues to exceed our expectations with strong demand in streamline execution by our teams. We also added to our BookingSuite offering in Q2, with the acquisition of PriceMatch, a simple cloud-based tool that uses big data to help our partners improve their properties' production through enhanced revenue management.
International results also benefited from Agoda.com and rentalcars.com. Agoda delivered a solid quarter consistent with Q1, with special attention to the collection of private sale deals for its logged-in customers. Strong momentum continued at rentalcars.com, which accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row. Furthering its lead, it's the world's largest dedicated site for multi-supplier rental car reservations.
Priceline.com continues to be a tale of two cities with strong retail performance, offset by its shrinking but still large Name Your Own Price business. The priceline.com management team is making targeted investments as part of its plan to drive innovation into its business and to solidify its position as the best site for travel deals in North America. There's a new level of energy at the company, and we expect great things in the coming quarters.
KAYAK delivered an exceptional bottom line performance in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations, while OpenTable continue to produce double-digit domestic diner growth. After some amount of work to transition its underlying B2B and B2C infrastructure, it's on track to begin launching new international markets later this year.
We took some steps in the quarter to further expand our growth in Latin America. Booking.com launched a TV advertising campaign in Brazil, while the group invested $60 million in a minority stake in Hotel Urbano, one of Brazil's largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. Our investment includes an exclusive commercial partnership, whereby, we will provide Hotel Urbano customers access to accommodations outside of Latin America. 
Finally and importantly, it is worth commenting on mobile. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this trend. Today, as a group, about 1 of 3 bookings of hotels, rental cars and restaurants happens on a mobile device. At current run rate, this will be more than half of our business in only 2 to 3 years. On a Sunday, just a week back, we completed a 300,000 transactions, gross of cancellations on mobile at Booking.com for the first time. All of our brands are investing heavily in making our products relevant to consumers across all their screens in a connected fashion and in ways that are industry-leading.
Since the end of Q1, we repurchased about $1.35 billion of our common stock and have an authorization of $1.4 billion remaining for future quarters.
The group performed well in the second quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We'll continue Booking.com's successful foray into brand advertising in certain international markets, and invest aggressively in online variable channels to profitably build our booking business for the seasonally strong third quarter. We remain committed to striking the right balance between top line growth and bottom line profitability, and you will see, in particular, more stability in non-advertising OpEx percentage in the second half as we anniversary the OpenTable and BookingSuite investments.
We believe we are making the smart and sustainable investments today that will extend our lead as the world's largest online travel business for years to come. We're also delivering healthy returns for our shareholders today.
I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported res",1943,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.
We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted by extreme currency volatility, because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 19% and 9%, respectively, for Q2 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar in Q2 relative to last year.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q2, Q3 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
The Priceline Group performed well through all these key metrics in Q2. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in overperformance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line.
Room night growth was strong in Q2 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 26% in the second quarter, accelerating slightly compared to 25% growth rate for Q1. Rental car days grew by 20% in Q2, also accelerating compared to Q1 growth of 18%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q2 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I just discussed.
While we were in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, our growth expressed in constant currency gives a truer picture of our fundamental business performance. It is more in line with what you would expect based upon our strong unit growth and constant currency ADR growth.
Specifically, our Q2 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 11% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis and by only about 12% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business grew by 1%. 
Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower airfares impacted retailer gross bookings growth, but have no impact on gross profit.
Gross profit for the quarter was $2.1 billion, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.8 billion, which grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by 8% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $303 million, which represented 32% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q2 of about $62 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 37.3% of gross profit for Q2, which is 469 bps lower than last year. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that partly benefits revenue in Q3 when summer travel takes place. 
In addition, as we've highlighted over recent quarters, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of our core travel business to handle future growth. Q2 will also reflect the leverage from the inclusion of OpEx for our OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services, which are currently in investment mode as we invest to plant seeds for future growth.
Operating margins were, however, better than our guidance due mainly to lower-than-forecasted non-advertising OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $805 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $765 million and represents a 1% decrease versus prior year, reflecting the significant foreign currency translation impact with the stronger U.S. dollar.
Non-GAAP net income decreased by 2% and non-GAAP EPS decreased by 1%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $702 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2015, which is about 2% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $53 million in CapEx and repurchased 720,000 shares of our common stock for $849 million in Q2. Thus far in Q3, we repurchased an additional 436,000 shares for $500 million.
We expect to execute the remaining $1.4 billion of our $3 billion common stock buyback authorization at a pace that makes sense based upon the price in which our stock is trading, available cash in the U.S. and potential uses for other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at June 30, 2015, with about $1.9 billion of that balance in the U.S.
During Q2, we entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility is a 5-year term and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost. 
Now for Q3 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our room night growth has been remarkably resilient, ranging between 24% to 27% over the last 4 quarters. Our guidance reflects another strong quarter of growth, but assumes that our growth rates will decelerate, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends.
Our Q3 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.09 per euro and $1.56 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 18% for the euro and about 7% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. 
I highlight that the euro exchange rate is worse than $1.12 rate that prevailed when we last recorded and most analysts updated their forecasts. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and the remainder of the year.  Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comes will become less challenging after Q3.
For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant currency basis and by minus 1% to positive 6% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with the prior year.  We expect international gross bookings to grow by 16% to 23% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 19% to 26% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. 
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q3. We expect about 160 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, which is a nice improvement from the margin pressure we have seen in the last couple of quarters. The deleverage is mainly attributable to assumed continued pressure for online advertising ROIs, but to a lesser extent than we saw in Q2.
As we indicated on the last couple of earnings calls, margin pressure from non-advertising OpEx diminishes significantly in Q3, and we expect that trend to improve further in Q4. Over the longer term, we expect that our non-advertising OpEx will generally grow more slowly than our gross profit and be a source of operating leverage.
Our forecast implies a 52% operating margin for Q3. The strong operating margins for our business relative to our competitors positionsus well to succeed over the long term in a very competitive market. 
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.425 billion and $1.525 billion which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. 
We are targeting non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS of approximately $22.95 to $24.45 per share which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 7% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of about $1.7 billion of share repurchases we have made, thus far, this year.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.84 and $20 -- $22.34 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping matter. Darren mentioned the Booking.com's platform now has over 707,000 hotels and other accommodations, including 313,000 vacation rental properties. In September, we intend to adjust our methodology for reporting property counts to include properties that are contracted with Booking.com, but are not currently available to be booked on our site. 
For example, we will now include properties in our account that are temporarily unavailable on our site because we filled all the rooms alloted to us where the property is closed seasonally or for renovations. Under the new methodology, we would've reported about 767,000 properties, including about 353,000 vacation rentals. Our prior year property count on a consistent basis is about 549,000 properties, including about 206,000 vacation rentals. We believe this change will remove volatility from our property count reporting and will reflect the more consistent count of our total active partner relationships throughout the year. This is a small, but important adjustment as we continue to add more and more long tail and sometimes seasonal business.
We will now take your questions."

So I think it's important on mobile to this thing -- obviously, there's web-based mobile and there's app-based mobile. And web-based mobile, still largely and traditionally through Google and other search engines. And I have to give Google a lot of credit, that's working better and better for us, where our web-based mobile is highly converting big-based transactions for us and ends up in the hotel space transactions are relatively infrequent. So a pretty significant percentage happen on web-based, particularly customers we've never seen before. Our app-based customers tend to be our more loyal customers. And the place that we built those is mostly from our own property sites. We do go out and buy app downloads, although app downloads don't tend to be very economic because they often get downloaded and then not ultimately used at least from that space. So this is basically the world of accommodation. It's very different for KAYAK and OpenTable, primarily because both of businesses are a much higher frequency business. They're very heavily skewed to app. And the whole business of getting people to use the KAYAK app to check for flights or OpenTable to book restaurants is another dynamic, and both of those businesses focus heavier and can find economics and actually getting downloads and building lifetime value to customers that are app-based. And those app-based downloads, there's a little bit of that, that comes from Google, but a lot has come from new places like Facebook and other partners. On Facebook, specifically, we -- we've been -- we generate most of our demand from basically search or travel. And travel includes everything from TripAdvisor, down to easyJet, and airlines, and trains and other things. So we've always dreamed of that time where we could access demand from any of these big horizontal audiences. Facebook is obviously one, Twitter is another. You can think of WeChat or any of these other things. So just being -- or even the big portals, Yahoo!, MSN, those places. But we've always struggled. And I was quite skeptical, but I have to get Facebook a ton of credit. We're finally getting some good business out of Facebook. Most of it is remarketing or remessaging. And we've now talked with senior management at Facebook about how do we get intent out of their network, and that's an area that both us and them are focused on into a degree in which we can crack the code on intent would make Facebook a real serious source of demand for us as a business. And obviously, as a performance marketer, that would be a big deal for Facebook as well. So I'm excited the progress we're making. They're investing a lot of time, energy into which I appreciate. And hopefully, by cracking another source of demand, it allows us to also -- to diversify where we spend our money to find hotel customers."

Well, first of all, we started out as being a hotel-only site, but it's been some years now that we have built out other forms of multiroom accommodation. And even in our old -- in the old Booking.com model even said online hotel reservations was their sub-tag. But starting even 4 or 5 years ago, we started adding B&Bs and we even have treehouses and igloos and stationary boats. And basically, other things that you could book. So for us, we went from being the world's largest online hotel player to now being the world's largest player in online accommodation. So moving into vacation rentals is a very natural thing for us. It's kind of going down the pyramid and ultimately, getting into this self-catered product. And for us, we're building it out in an instantly bookable, verifiable way, which is very different than what, say, a HomeAway or an Airbnb is doing. We've also focused a lot on making sure the customer experience didn't have all the friction. If you can think of booking a vacation home and having to put down a deposit and having multiple e-mail exchanges, and not really knowing you've got the property, not really having the trust, we're doing in much more kind of a peer e-commerce way. Just trying to create it ultimately, like booking a hotel. And through that strategy, we've had obviously take a lot of friction of the industry and change the way that players think about that. And it's a lot of work because for a vacation rental owner, you've got to maintain additional calendar. You can't overbook people. When you say the place is available at a certain price, it has to sell at that price. But slowly, we're seeing the ice start to crack a little bit and starting to see real momentum. And this is a -- this is great news for vacation rental owners because this market has a lot of demand, and a lot of people really think of vacation rentals as an upgrade. Like if you've got a family or your group and you're, say, going to Barcelona. Instead of getting like 4 hotel rooms, you can get a vacation home on the beach. And you can make your own meals instead of going out to restaurants every night. So this is a very important addition to our business, but there's a lot more work to do. We do have some cooperation with HomeAway, but it's not near the extent that maybe some of our competitors. And we're still talking there. We have a fairly high bar. We don't do on-request bookings. And for us, it has to be truly instant. It can't be ""Okay, I'll let you know in 24 hours."" That doesn't count as instant. And that's a part of the issue, just keeping a very high bar and keeping our product very pure, so that it fits with our traditional book or base. So far, so good, and I -- and we're only going to do more of it. It wasn't really a jump into a segment. It was more of an evolution down the accommodation pyramid into the sort of the bottom of the pyramid, which really millions and millions of single-owner property around the world book in cities, on beaches, at ski resorts, et cetera. So that's the story there."

Of course, always, first, focused on core search, what are the other things we can do to innovate to get more out of core search. And we've seen some benefit, particularly in mobile web where we work together to try to get more out of mobile web, and that's been I think very successful. And we're also working with the YouTube team, and we're also doing a lot of work on retargeting. So Google kind of sees us as one of their biggest advertisers in the world. So there's -- and we're a very technically performance-driven people. So we work closely together to try to get more out of all the various Google engines. Very specifically, hotel price ads is Google's priced product. We don't love it because we would rather buy BlueLinx. We don't need all the extra lifting, but we do understand. And we have worked a lot with the HBA team to make that a better product. I think when it started out, there were a lot of savings and things shown on HBA. They just weren't real savings. Generally, in that, there's a lot of challenges with showing customers things they're saving. We're now a large majority of the time they're not, its exchange rates, people don't put taxes on, et cetera. It's a real -- it's not the prettiest space. So we were tied with them to improve our product. And then recently, as you mentioned, they've launched an instant book product. It's still very early on. We don't love instant book products either because we have a really good process of taking cold customers and turn them into paying customers. So anyone who creates a path would end up becoming a lower common denominator, that's not good for us because we think we have one of the best booking path. We have an agency model. We don't even need the credit card in many cases to do bookings. So -- but we're working also with Google on that, not standing away from and saying, ""Hey, is there a way to make this work for our businesses as well as what you're trying to achieve?"" So it's always been a close-open collaboration, but as I always say, we're going to put our money where it's strategic. We're going to watch this really closely, and we have lots of options on where to spend our money. We look to continue to create more options to find hotel demand in the future."

And I would say, across all of our brands, every single brand, a repeat business every year gets stronger and stronger. A lot of that is related to the new multiscreen environment. A lot of that is related to -- we do a lot more business with signed-in accounts. In the early days, when it was a single-screen, you would do transactional business. And every time you book a hotel or a flight, you have to reenter all your information. But once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name and at least to like 1-click booking. And as we've gone to more a multiscreen environment, that advantage for an account holder goes up dramatically. If you've ever tried to book an airline ticket on a mobile phone and not have an account, you'll know what I'm talking about. It's not a pleasant experience. But once you have an account, you can fill up the forms, so we can facilitate that. And then you can take your confirmation that maybe you booked on your tablet, and you can show up at the rental counter with the confirmation on your phone. These are all positives that have driven to more increased repeat business and loyalty among our customers. Then our challenge becomes really and has been how do we bring more customers into the franchise, and that's what we used paid marketing for. But generally speaking, our direct business continues to increase, which gives a reflection, generally, of repeat business."

So first of all, in the second quarter, Europe has been very strong. The Eurozone and Southern Europe was a little bit of the ripple of the Grexit and the coming back of Greece. But generally, Europe has been very solid this year. U.S. is strong for U.S. travelers and China inbound. But generally, almost everyone else is a little -- going a little less for the U.S. because of the currency effect. And yes, China outbound continues to be very strong for us, growing a very fast rate. Japan inbound, Taiwan inbound, very strong. Korean inbound, not so strong because of MERS, not something that gets talked about a lot in the United States, but was a real overhang for us. But on the other hand, we had positive comps. Southeast Asia was a much calmer place in Q2 than it was last Q2. If you remember the Malaysian Air crisis, the coup in Thailand, the burning of factories in Vietnam, there are all sorts of things going on, but that's been a positive from a comp basis. And so that's some quarterly commentary, geographically. But specifically, strategically, Latin America, we entered Latin America -- it started with the Booking.com ran a number of years ago, starting in Argentina moving to Brazil. I would say, this is a year where we've really had a breakthrough in Latin America. We launched our TV ads in Brazil. But really despite the fact that Latin America is not in the greatest economic health right now and the 2 big engines, which are Argentina and most specifically, Brazil, have all kinds of issues. But this is in a year where we've really gotten great traction in the market, maybe passed the tipping point. We have offices now across the region, and that's a real positive. And I think if you go to Latin America now, our Asian brand awareness is quite high. Hotel Urbano, specifically, this is a -- it's actually a site that gets a tremendous amount of traffic but still, it's a bit challenged in converting that traffic, but has a great management team. We've always been excited about the volume of audience that they have largely built through social channels. And you can think of this as kind of a mini-featured investment. I mean we made an investment in the company, but it was really also to unlock the commercial opportunity. We're like, well, if we're going to help these guys win, let's participate a little bit in that upside with the commercial opportunity is -- I wouldn't say, it's a make or break for Latin America, but it's a good-sized piece of business that will help bring Latin American-outbound travelers to the rest of the world. I think it also -- it's a reflection of the strength of our portfolio. It's so global that these matchup should make so much sense because the product converts well. It's a great product. It's all translated, and we can take an audience like this, help Hotel Urbano monetize, but also create a great commercial opportunities for us as well."

And that's really our push in the -- on the paid advertising side. On -- the thing that we go out a little bit on a limb in is our brand marketing. We now know that we can get a pretty good return on our brand marketing, but it may not happen immediately. But we've shown, and over time, in the markets we've been in for a while, that we can get a better return on our advertising when you add the brand marketing to our performance marketing, send the return we got on our performance marketing alone. And we've done a bunch to build it. It's the whole bunch of data-driven tools to help us with our media mix. And that's helped us be smarter and data-driven about where and how we spend our brand marketing dollars. So we're building over whatever now. It's been a couple of years, some more and more confidence in our ability to appropriately spend our brand marketing dollars, which obviously is a big growth potential for the company. Booking.com is not a household name. If you go to America, you'd mentioned OpenTable and KAYAK and Priceline before you'd mention Booking. And the ability for us to build the brand and have great performance marketing is still growth potential that's not ahead of us, and we've been working hard and methodically attack that. I would say, our growth is truly sustainable growth because the trademark in it we're spending is earning us profit, and all the direct business we're coming is earning us, of course, even more profit. So I don't feel like -- as opposed to some geographies, we have positive unit economics on every single transaction. And we've looked to improve that. And any incremental that we're making in marketing generally comes with positive EBITDA. So -- and we're always trying to get as far as we can to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow for our customers without worrying about the percentage of our P&L that gets taken up by marketing. And that's been our general philosophy. Some people may say, ""Well, if you're that far, why don't you go a little bit further?"" And that's always the balance that we're striking on what business do we bring in and do we really truly understand the economics, but always trying to be positive on a transaction-by-transaction basis."

And always, the question is, is your advertiser trying to be an OTA? And at the most extreme, being an OTA is really hard work, like 3/4 of our people are in customer service. They're in the field, they're working property by property on pricing and on availability, and it's a business you have to do at scale. And most of them are media partners, makes a lot of money out of it. On TripAdvisor, we spend more than $1 million a day. So we have to find a place to spend our money and we, of course, don't want to spend it with somebody who's planning on being an OTA. I don't believe that's really what TripAdvisor is trying to do, but we have to make sure that whatever business we participate in is good business and it's a business that we can ultimately pay for that or repeat on our platform. So that's why there's a lot of discussion in this area. There's not like a big rainbow for anyone that's in the media business on the other side because they get most of the economics for the transaction anyway. It's not like suddenly, there's a whole bunch more money there. In fact, all there is, is just a lot more costs. If you have to think of -- I could show you my inbox someday and some of the escalations I get, the dirty ocean in Cabo, beat the person who wants a refund or the flying ants, and it's -- the OTA business sounds very sexy but, in fact, there's a lot of manual work. And that's why there's only a few players who do this work and do it at scale. And by the way, I saw Ctrip in here as well. That's why they do it so well. They've got over 10,000 customer service agents to deal with this kind of stuff everyday. So we're being good partners. We're leaning in. I frankly think that InstaBook path, ultimately, will prove to be cannibalistic. They may help a little bit on mobile, but that's all to be seen. So we're trying to be positive partners in the process, and try to make sure that if that's the way our advertising partners are going, that we can design a path, that is a good option for us and -- where we can get good business off of it."

When you ultimately do a transaction on mobile, it's a question of, what other screens that the customer engage with you on, how do they get to know the brand. And then there's an issue, of course, of can you -- do you have the force through your brand. And by having a stronger brand, you get more loyal customers who then, therefore, go a more app-based mobile versus web-based mobile. To me, at the highest level, I think of mobile as a huge positive for a company like ours. For many of our partners, it's tough enough to build a great website. They actually have a multiscreen experience that works within account. It's a very difficult thing to do. So that's why I think net is a positive. I don't think it necessarily drives a lot of incremental business for us with a little bit -- maybe more last minute, but it's really a shifting in the way that people engage with digital assets. I -- I'm sure marketing mix will change relative to mobile. I've talked previously that more and more business is coming direct. It's a bit of a chicken and egg. Some of that maybe because our mobile business tends to be more direct than our PC-based web business. But again, I think it's all 1 customer and it's all related to the fact that people are living multiscreen lifestyles versus single-screen lifestyles, which I think is a net benefit to us. And ultimately, I think it also leads to more direct account-driven traffic versus purely off of the web transactional traffic. I think the -- I would -- I guess, the last thing I would say, and you certainly see this in China, the impact of mobile and how like Ctrip buys their demand. And we've learned so much from that relationship, and I always appreciate all the time we get with James and Jane, but it's amazing how they just buy traffic differently. There are a whole marketplaces for apps. In China, it exist that don't exist in the Western world. And how they build that up is it's quite fascinating and amazing, and I think there's a lot of lessons for us to learn as this environment changes. But yes, most -- today, again, as I said before, most of our app downloads are from our own properties, which means it would have had to find they get some other way. Like in the past, they're more and more than the used apps in a sticky way, obviously that's great business for us because it's always coming direct by definition and it's very profitable."

And in terms of the -- its vacation rentals, incremental or not, our general voice is -- first of all, it's 1 customer and either a customer is just a consumer or their business person and a consumer, and they take a number of trips every year. And every trip has a different rationale. And if somebody gives a hotel book around 3 other trips, they may be on a trip with their family and become a vacation rental booker. We want to be able to provide all of those instances and all of those scenarios through Booking.com, so they become comfortable with that rather than in the past. And so if I need a hotel, I go to Booking. And if I need a vacation rental, I go to company XY or Z. The markets have traditionally been very different because of the nature of the markets were very different. But more and more, over time -- and I think we're partly shaping that and I believe that's ultimately going to be the outcome, the markets get a little bit mixed because the person says, ""Hey, I'm going to Barcelona or I'm going to Rio de Janeiro, and I need to find a place to stay."" It's a very common question asked, where am I going to stay. And relative to that scenario, we want to provide them an option. And that option -- by having more optionality in that, you can drive incrementality because the person may not find quite the right thing on a site that has a more narrow set of options. But on our broad set of options, maybe they have a certain price range and a certain thing they're looking, we'll be able to satisfy that. Or in a market like San Francisco or New York, if ADRs and hotels are really high, maybe a business person ends up in an apartment. Or if you got a big event on like the World Cup or the Olympics, where everything gets sold out, having all of this incremental supply, it offers more of that so people can complete them. So I think about it today -- if today's market is very different between the vacation rental buyer and the hotel buyer, over time, that will only coalesce to become a more similar market because all it is, is human beings looking for a place to stay. And I think that's generally the case that we're seeing on our site. Now certainly, vacation rental space are generally bigger groups, they're generally longer length of stay, slightly higher ADR, relative to good take rate. There's always fundamentals that reflect the market of today, but I do believe that those things will continue to change. And I think if they could just -- like B&Bs used to be a very different thing in hotels, I think, over time, accommodations will become more similar than less similar because it's the same customer."

As we end up spending in the markets we want to spend at the levels we want to spend, we could see pressure from a time to time as we enter a new market or we increase our spending in the market. But over the long run, we should have leverage there. The online advertising is a big variable. It's very hard to predict. But the OpEx is much more under our control, and we've had a good track record there over many years. So we feel comfortable that over the long term, we could have operating leverage in that line item. For Q3 and Q4, it is largely that we're lapping the acquisition of OpenTable and the acquisitions we made in the BookingSuite area. But as we've seen from time to time in the past, we have some lumpiness in the investments that we make in the core business. So in the early part of the year, we typically ramp up our customer service teams, our hotel teams to get ready for peak travel season, and then we see leverage in that line item.

Thanks, Kevin. So at the highest level, I think, for those who follow this, we worked with the competition authorities in France, Sweden and Italy, a kindred agreement on what we call, Narrow MSN, which basically allows us to keep parity with the hotel's website. And Expedia has also agreed to that. We've had a number of countries come out formally, Austria, Denmark, the same agree to us many others informally have dropped their cases against us. We've got 1 challenge in France, a lot has come out banning parity, which we weren't consulted on or anything, but we'll come in the SEC. We, of course, will follow the law. But I think the basic bottom line to understand in this whole discussion, we will never charge our customers more. You can say it clearer, we will never charge our customers more. So we will adjust to whatever environment it is, and we'll make sure that we get the best pricing for our customer. And in some case, we have so much innovation we could do to make sure our customers don't get shown prices that are uncompetitive. And that's -- I don't believe the new law in France is good for consumers. I don't think it's good for the French tourism. I don't think it's good for small properties in France. I actually think it's quite negative, but it is what it is, and we will adjust our model. And our business in France is really strong, both from a booker's standpoint as well as bookings coming into France. So it doesn't concern me too much other than just a lot of the time invested in this whole area. And I strongly believe it's -- I mean, parity was an invention of the hotel industry. So I strongly believe it's a good way that all travel should be sold on a basis where customers don't spend too much time searching, and that they decide which channel from an agnostic standpoint that they want to buy through. But we're more than ready to compete under any set of standards and hope that the Narrow MSN will be accepted more broadly across Europe.
Okay. I guess that's it. Thank you all for joining our conference call and look forward to speaking to you next quarter."

The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $15 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 113 million room nights in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting slight acceleration for the second consecutive quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $12.45, down slightly versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.85 per share and our guidance for the quarter.  
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were, again, impacted substantially by the strong dollar. 
Our International business recorded 30% gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis, up from 29% last quarter. Booking.com continues to benefit from further penetration of its existing partner relationships as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has about 707,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 35% over last year, including 313,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties.
Vacation rental properties grew 62% year-over-year, and now represent 1.7 million rentable units within these properties. In the last 12 months, about 50 million room nights for vacation rental properties were booked on Booking.com and Villas.com, up 39% year-over-year. This quarter, we began experimenting with self on-boarding of individually owned vacation rental properties, subject, of course, to a set of quality checks on our side and the ability of the property to be instantly bookable.
We already have an encouraging pipeline of vacation rental properties to activate via this channel, and we're hopeful that this functionality will help us scale our property acquisition even further.
BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform, is off to an impressive start and continues to exceed our expectations with strong demand and streamlined execution by our teams. We also added to our BookingSuite offering in Q2, with the acquisition of PriceMatch, a simple cloud-based tool that uses big data to help our partners improve their properties' production through enhanced revenue management.
International results also benefited from Agoda.com and rentalcars.com. Agoda delivered a solid quarter consistent with Q1, with special attention to the collection of private sale deals for its logged-in customers. Strong momentum continued at rentalcars.com, which accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row. Furthering its lead as the world's largest dedicated site for multi-supplier rental car reservations.
Priceline.com continues to be a tale of two cities with strong retail performance, offset by its shrinking, but still large, Name Your Own Price business. The priceline.com management team is making targeted investments as part of its plan to drive innovation into its business and to solidify its position as the best site for travel deals in North America. There's a new level of energy at the company, and we expect great things in the coming quarters.
KAYAK delivered an exceptional bottom line performance in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations, while OpenTable continued to produce double-digit domestic diner growth. After some amount of work to transition its underlying B2B and B2C infrastructure, it's on track to begin launching new international markets later this year.
We took some steps in the quarter to further expand our growth in Latin America. Booking.com launched a TV advertising campaign in Brazil, while the group invested $60 million in a minority stake in Hotel Urbano, one of Brazil's largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. Our investment includes an exclusive commercial partnership, whereby, we will provide Hotel Urbano customers access to accommodations outside of Latin America. 
Finally and importantly, it is worth commenting on mobile. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this trend. Today, as a group, about 1 of 3 bookings of hotels, rental cars and restaurants happens on a mobile device. At current run rate, this will be more than half of our business in only 2 to 3 years. On a Sunday, just a week back, we completed 300,000 transactions, gross of cancellations on mobile at Booking.com for the first time. All of our brands are investing heavily in making our products relevant to consumers across all their screens in a connected fashion and in ways that are industry-leading.
Since the end of Q1, we repurchased about $1.35 billion of our common stock and have an authorization of $1.4 billion remaining for future quarters.
The group performed well in the second quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We'll continue Booking.com's successful foray into brand advertising in certain international markets, and invest aggressively in online variable channels to profitably build our book of business for the seasonally strong third quarter. We remain committed to striking the right balance between top line growth and bottom line profitability, and you will see, in particular, more stability in non-advertising OpEx percentage in the second half as we anniversary the OpenTable and BookingSuite investments.
We believe we are making the smart and sustainable investments today that will extend our lead as the world's largest online travel business for years to come, while also delivering healthy returns for our shareholders today.
I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. 
I will now turn it over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials."
33254,306770205,849584,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported res",1947,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.
We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted by extreme currency volatility, because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, were weaker by about 19% and 9%, respectively, for Q2 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar in Q2 relative to last year.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q2, Q3 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
The Priceline Group performed well for all these key metrics in Q2. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in overperformance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line.
Room night growth was strong in Q2 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 26% in the second quarter, accelerating slightly compared to the 25% growth rate for Q1. Rental car days grew by 20% in Q2, also accelerating compared to Q1 growth of 18%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q2 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I've just discussed.
While we were in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, our growth expressed in constant currency gives a truer picture of our fundamental business performance. And it is more in line with what you would expect based upon our strong unit growth and constant currency ADR growth.
Specifically, our Q2 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 11% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis and by only about 12% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business grew by 1%. 
Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower airfares impacted retail air gross bookings growth, but have no impact on gross profit.
Gross profit for the quarter was $2.1 billion, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated a gross profit of $1.8 billion, which grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by 8% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $303 million, which represented 32% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q2 of about $62 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 37.3% of gross profit for Q2, which is 469 bps lower than last year. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that partly benefits revenue in Q3 when summer travel takes place. 
In addition, as we've highlighted over recent quarters, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of our core travel business to handle future growth. Q2 will also reflect the leverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services, which are currently in investment mode as we invest to plant seeds for future growth.
Operating margins were, however, better than our guidance due mainly to lower-than-forecasted non-advertising OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $805 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $765 million and represents a 1% decrease versus prior year, reflecting the significant foreign currency translation impact with the stronger U.S. dollar.
Non-GAAP net income decreased by 2% and non-GAAP EPS decreased by 1%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $702 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2015, which is about 2% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $53 million in CapEx and repurchased 720,000 shares of our common stock for $849 million in Q2. Thus far in Q3, we repurchased an additional 436,000 shares for $500 million.
We expect to execute the remaining $1.4 billion of our $3 billion common stock buyback authorization at a pace that makes sense based upon the price at which our stock is trading, available cash in the U.S. and potential uses for other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at June 30, 2015, with about $1.9 billion of that balance in the U.S.
During Q2, we entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility has a 5-year term and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost. 
Now for Q3 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our room night growth has been remarkably resilient, ranging between 24% to 27% over the last 4 quarters. Our guidance reflects another strong quarter of growth, but assumes that our growth rates will decelerate, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends.
Our Q3 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.09 per euro and $1.56 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 18% for the euro and about 7% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. 
I highlight that the euro exchange rate is worse than $1.12 rate that prevailed when we last reported and most analysts updated their forecasts. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and the remainder of the year.  Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q3.
For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant currency basis and by minus 1% to positive 6% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with the prior year.  We expect international gross bookings to grow by 16% to 23% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 19% to 26% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. 
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q3. We expect about 160 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, which is a nice improvement from the margin pressure we have seen in the last couple of quarters. The deleverage is mainly attributable to assumed continued pressure for online advertising ROIs, but to a lesser extent than we saw in Q2.
As we indicated on the last couple of earnings calls, margin pressure from non-advertising OpEx diminishes significantly in Q3, and we expect that trend to improve further in Q4. Over the longer term, we expect that our non-advertising OpEx will generally grow more slowly than our gross profit and be a source of operating leverage.
Our forecast implies a 52% operating margin for Q3. The strong operating margins for our business relative to our competitors positions us well to succeed over the long term in a very competitive market. 
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.425 billion and $1.525 billion which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. 
We are targeting non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS of approximately $22.95 to $24.45 per share which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 7% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of about $1.7 billion of share repurchases we have made, thus far, this year.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.84 and $20 -- $22.34 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping matter. Darren mentioned that Booking.com's platform now has over 707,000 hotels and other accommodations, including 313,000 vacation rental properties. In September, we intend to adjust our methodology for reporting property counts to include properties that are contracted with Booking.com, but are not currently available to be booked on our site. 
For example, we will now include properties in our account that are temporarily unavailable on our site because we filled all the rooms allotted to us, or the property is closed seasonally or for renovations. Under the new methodology, we would've reported about 767,000 properties, including about 353,000 vacation rentals. Our prior year property count on a consistent basis is about 549,000 properties, including about 206,000 vacation rentals. We believe this change will remove volatility from our property count reporting and will reflect a more consistent count of our total active partner relationships throughout the year. This is a small, but important adjustment as we continue to add more and more long tail and sometimes seasonal business.
We will now take your questions."

So I think it's important on mobile to -- obviously, there's web-based mobile and there's app-based mobile. And web-based mobile, still largely and traditionally it's through Google and other search engines. And I have to give Google a lot of credit, that's working better and better for us, where web-based mobile is highly converting big base of transactions for us. And it ends up in the hotel space transactions are relatively infrequent. So a pretty significant percentage happen on web-based, particularly customers we've never seen before. Our app-based customers tend to be our more loyal customers. And the place that we build those is mostly from our own property sites. We do go out and buy app downloads, although app downloads don't tend to be very economic because they often get downloaded and then not ultimately used at least in that space. So this is basically the world of accommodations. It's very different for KAYAK and OpenTable, primarily because both of businesses are a much higher frequency business. They're very heavily skewed to app. And the whole business of getting people to use the KAYAK app to check for flights or OpenTable to book restaurants is another dynamic, and both of those businesses focus heavier and can find economics and actually getting downloads and building lifetime value to customers that are app-based. And those app-based downloads, there's a little bit of that, that comes from Google, but a lot has come from new places like Facebook and other partners. On Facebook, specifically, we -- we've been -- we generate most of our demand from basically search or travel. And travel includes everything from TripAdvisor, down to easyJet, and airlines, and trains and other things. So we've always dreamed of a time where we could access demand from any of these big horizontal audiences. Facebook is obviously one, Twitter is another. You can think of WeChat or any of these other things are just being -- or even the big portals, Yahoo!, MSN, as places. But we've always struggled. And I was quite skeptical, but I have to get Facebook a ton of credit. We're finally getting some good business out of Facebook. Most of it is remarketing or remessaging. And we've now talked with senior management at Facebook about how do we get intent out of their network, and that's an area that both us and them are focused and to the degree in which we can crack the code on intent would make Facebook a real serious source of demand for us as a business. And obviously, as a performance marketer, that would be a big deal for Facebook as well. So I'm excited the progress we're making. They're investing a lot of time and energy into it, which I appreciate. And hopefully, by cracking another source of demand, it allows us to also -- to diversify where we spend our money to find hotel customers."

Well, first of all, we started out as being a hotel-only site, but it's been some years now that we have built out other forms of multiroom accommodation. And even in our old -- in the old Booking.com model it even said online hotel reservations was their sub-tag. But starting even 4 or 5 years ago, we started adding B&Bs and we even have treehouses and igloos and stationary boats. And basically, other things that you could book. So for us, we went from being the world's largest online hotel player to now being the world's largest player in online accommodations. So moving into vacation rentals is a very natural thing for us. It's kind of going down the pyramid and ultimately, getting into this self-catered product. And for us, we're building it out in an instantly bookable, verifiable way, which is very different than what, say, a HomeAway or an Airbnb is doing. We've also focused a lot on making sure the customer experience didn't have all the friction. If you can think of booking a vacation home and having to put down a deposit and having multiple e-mail exchanges, and not really knowing you've got the property, not really having the trust, we're doing in much more kind of a peer e-commerce way. Just trying to create it ultimately, like booking a hotel. And through that strategy, we've had to obviously take a lot of friction out of the industry and change the way that players think about that. And it's a lot of work because for a vacation rental owner, you've got to maintain a digital calendar. You can't overbook people. When you say the place is available at a certain price, it has to sell at that price. But slowly, we're seeing the ice start to crack a little bit and starting to see real momentum. And this is a -- this is great news for a vacation rental owner because this market has a lot of demand, and a lot of people really think of vacation rentals as an upgrade. Like if you've got a family or your group and you're, say, going to Barcelona. Instead of getting like 4 hotel rooms, you can get a vacation home on the beach. And you can make your own meals instead of going out to restaurants every night. So this is a very important addition to our business, but there's a lot more work to do. We do have some cooperation with HomeAway, but it's not near the extent that maybe some of our competitors. And we're still talking there. We have a fairly high bar. We don't do on-request bookings. And for us, it has to be truly instant. It can't be ""Okay, I'll let you know in 24 hours."" That doesn't count as instant. And that's been part of the issue, is just keeping a very high bar and keeping our product very pure, so that it fits with our traditional booker base. So far, so good, and I -- and we're only going to do more of it. It wasn't really a jump into a segment. It was more of an evolution down the accommodation pyramid into the sort of the bottom of the pyramid, which is literally millions and millions of single-owner properties around the world both in cities, on beaches, at ski resorts, et cetera.

I mean it's an amazing business, but it's become less of a percent of our business over time. So we've been working with them across our entire business. Of course, always, first, focused on core search, what are the other things we can do to innovate to get more out of core search. And we've seen some benefit, particularly in mobile web where we work together to try to get more out of mobile web, and that's been I think very successful. But we're also working with the YouTube team, and we're also doing a lot of work on retargeting. So Google kind of sees us as one of their biggest advertisers in the world. So there's -- and we're very technically performance-driven people. So we work closely together to try to get more out of all the various Google engines. Very specifically, hotel price ads is Google's price product. We don't love it because we would rather buy BlueLinx. We don't need all the extra listing, but we do understand. And we have worked a lot with the HPA team to make that a better product. I think when it started out, there were a lot of savings and things shown on HPA. They just weren't real savings. Generally, in meta there's a lot of challenges with showing customers things they're savings when a large majority of the time they're not, its exchange rates, people don't put taxes on, et cetera. It's a real -- it's not the prettiest space. So we've worked hard with them to improve that product. And then recently, as you mentioned, they've launched an instant book product. It's still very early on. We don't love instant book products either because we have a really good process of taking cold customers and turning them into paying customers. So anyone who creates a path that ends up becoming a lower common denominator, that's not good for us because we think we have one of the best booking paths. We have an agency model. We don't even need the credit card in many cases to do bookings. So -- but we're working also with Google on that, not standing away from it and saying, ""Hey, is there a way to make this work for our businesses as well as what you're trying to achieve?"" So it's always been a close, open collaboration, but as I always say, we're going to put our money where it's strategic. We're going to watch this really closely, and we have lots of options on where to spend our money. We look to continue to create more options to find hotel demand in the future."

Well, you have to go across our brands, but we never reveal the exact percentages, but we have a very healthy repeat business. And I would say, across all of our brands, every single brand, the repeat business every year gets stronger and stronger. A lot of that is related to the new multiscreen environment. A lot of that is related to -- we do a lot more business with signed-in accounts. In the early days, when it was a single-screen, you would do transactional business. And every time you booked a hotel or a flight, you have to reenter all your information. But once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name and it leads to like 1-click booking. And as we've gone to more a multiscreen environment, that advantage for an account holder goes up dramatically. If you've ever tried to book an airline ticket on a mobile phone and not have an account, you'll know what I'm talking about. It's not a pleasant experience. But once you have an account, we can fill out the forms, and we can facilitate that. And then you can take your confirmation that maybe you booked on your tablet, and you can show up at the rental counter with the confirmation on your phone. These are all positives that have driven to more increased repeat business and loyalty among our customers. Then our challenge becomes really and has been how do we bring more customers into the franchise, and that's what we use paid marketing for. But generally speaking, our direct business continues to increase, which gives a reflection, generally, of repeat business."

So first of all, in the second quarter, Europe has been very strong. The Eurozone and Southern Europe with a little bit of the ripple of the Grexit and the coming back of Greece. But generally, Europe has been very solid this year. U.S. is strong for U.S. travelers and China inbound. But generally, almost everyone else is a little -- going a little less to the U.S. because of the currency effect. And yes, China outbound continues to be very strong for us, growing at very fast rates. Japan inbound, Taiwan inbound, very strong. Korean inbound, not so strong because of MERS, not something that gets talked about a lot in the United States, but was a real overhang for us. But on the other hand, we had positive comps. Southeast Asia was a much calmer place in Q2 than it was last Q2. If you remember the Malaysian Air crisis, the coup in Thailand, the burning of factories in Vietnam, there are all sorts of things going on, but that's been a positive from a comp basis. And so that's some quarterly commentary, geographically. But specifically, strategically, Latin America, we entered Latin America -- and specific with the Booking.com brand a number of years ago, starting in Argentina moving to Brazil. I would say, this is a year where we've really had a breakthrough in Latin America. We launched our TV ads in Brazil. But really despite the fact that Latin America is not in the greatest economic health right now and the 2 big engines, which are Argentina and most specifically, Brazil, have all kinds of issues. But this is in a year where we've really gotten great traction in the market, maybe passed the tipping point. We have offices now across the region, and that's a real positive. And I think if you go to Latin America now, our aided [ph] brand awareness is quite high. Hotel Urbano, specifically, this is a -- it's actually a site that gets a tremendous amount of traffic but still, it's a bit challenged in converting that traffic, but it has a great management team. We've always been excited about the volume of audience that they have, largely built through social channels. And you can think of this as kind of a mini Ctrip investment. I mean we made an investment in the company, but it was really also to unlock the commercial opportunity. We're like, well, if we're going to help these guys win, let's participate a little bit in that upside. With the commercial opportunity is -- I wouldn't say, it's a make or break for Latin America, but it's a good-sized piece of business that will help bring Latin American-outbound travelers to the rest of the world. I think it also is a reflection of the strength of our portfolio. It's so global that these matchups just make so much sense because the product converts well. It's a great product. It's all translated, and we can take an audience like this, help Hotel Urbano monetize, but also create a great commercial opportunity for us as well."

And that's really our push in the -- on the paid advertising side. On -- the thing that we go out a little bit on a limb in is our brand marketing. We now know that we can get a pretty good return on our brand marketing, but it may not happen immediately. But we've shown that over time, in the markets we've been in for a while, that we can get a better return on our advertising when you add the brand marketing to our performance marketing than the return we got on our performance marketing alone. And we've done a bunch to build it, just a whole bunch of data-driven tools to help us with our media mix. And that's helped us be smarter and data-driven about where and how we spend our brand marketing dollars. So we're building over whatever now has been a couple of years, more and more confidence in our ability to appropriately spend our brand marketing dollars, which obviously is a big growth potential for the company. Booking.com is not a household name. If you go to America, you'd mentioned OpenTable and KAYAK and Priceline before you'd mention Booking. And the ability for us to build the brand and have great performance marketing is still growth potential that's out ahead of us, and we've been working hard and methodically attack that. I would say, our growth is truly sustainable growth because the paid marketing that we're spending is earning us profit, and all the direct business we're coming is earning us, of course, even more profit. So I don't feel like -- as opposed to some geographies, we have positive unit economics on every single transaction. And we've looked to improve that. And any incremental that we're making in marketing generally comes with positive EBITDA. So -- and we're always trying to get as far as we can to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow for our customers without worrying about the percentage of our P&L that gets taken up by marketing. And that's been our general philosophy. Some people may say, ""Well, if you're that far, why don't you go a little bit further?"" And that's always the balance that we're striking on what business do we bring in and do we really truly understand the economics, but always trying to be positive on a transaction-by-transaction basis."

And always the question is, is your advertiser trying to be an OTA? And at the most extreme, being an OTA is really hard work, like 3/4 of our people are in customer service. They're in the field, they're working property by property on pricing and on availability, and it's a business you have to do at scale. And most of our media partners makes a lot of money off of us. On TripAdvisor, we spend more than $1 million a day. So we have to find a place to spend our money and we, of course, don't want to spend it with somebody who's planning on being an OTA. I don't believe that's really what TripAdvisor is trying to do, but we have to make sure that whatever business we participate in is good business and it's business that we can ultimately pay for that will repeat on our platform. So that's why there's a lot of discussion in this area. There's not like a big rainbow for anyone that's in the media business on the other side because they get most of the economics of the transaction anyway. It's not like suddenly, there's a whole bunch more money there. In fact, all there is, is just a lot more cost. If you have to think of -- I could show you my inbox someday at some of the escalations I get of the dirty ocean in Cabo, because the person wants a refund or the flying ants, and it's -- the OTA business sounds very sexy but, in fact, there's a lot of manual work. And that's why there's only a few players who do this work and do it at scale. And by the way, I'd throw Ctrip in here as well. That's why they do it so well. They've got over 10,000 customer service agents who deal with this kind of stuff everyday. So we're being good partners. We're leaning in. I frankly think that the instant book path, ultimately, will prove to be cannibalistic. They may help a little bit on mobile, but that's all to be seen. So we're trying to be positive partners in the process, and try to make sure that if that's the way our advertising partners are going, that we can design a path that is a good auction for us and where we can get good business off of it."

When you ultimately do a transaction on mobile, it's a question of what other screens does the customer engage with you on? How did they get to know the brand? And then there's an issue, of course, of can you -- do you have the force through your brand. By having a stronger brand do you get more loyal customers who then, therefore, go a more app-based mobile versus web-based mobile. To me, at the highest level, I think of mobile as a huge positive for a company like ours. For many of our partners, it's tough enough to build a great website. To actually have a multiscreen experience that works with an account. It's a very difficult thing to do. So that's why I think net it's a positive. I don't think it necessarily drives a lot of incremental business for us, it was a little bit, maybe, more last minute, but it's really a shifting in the way that people engage with digital assets. I -- I'm sure marketing mix will change relative to mobile. I've talked previously that more and more business is coming direct. It's a bit of a chicken and egg. Some of that maybe because our mobile business tends to be more direct than our PC-based web business. But again, I think it's all 1 customer and it's all related to the fact that people are living multiscreen lifestyles versus single-screen lifestyles, which I think is a net benefit to us. And ultimately, I think, also leads to more direct account-driven traffic versus purely off of the web transactional traffic. I think the -- I would -- I guess, the last thing I would say, and you certainly see this in China, the impact of mobile and how, like, Ctrip buys their demand. And we've learned so much from that relationship, and I always appreciate all the time I get with James and Jane, but it's amazing how they just buy traffic differently. There are whole marketplaces for apps In China that exist -- that don't exist in the Western world. And how they've built that up is it's quite fascinating and amazing, and I think there's a lot of lessons for us to learn as this environment changes. But yes, most -- today, again, as I said before, most of our app downloads are from our own properties, which means it would have had to find they get some other way in the past. So the more and more of them that use apps in a sticky way, obviously that's great business for us because it's always coming direct by definition and is very profitable."

And in terms of the -- is vacation rentals incremental or not. Our general belief is, first of all, it's 1 customer and either a customer is just a consumer or they're a business person and a consumer, and they take a number of trips every year. And every trip has a different rationale. And if somebody is a hotel booker on 3 other trips, they may be on a trip with their family and become a vacation rental booker. We want to be able to provide all of those instances and all of those scenarios through Booking.com, so they become comfortable with that rather than in the past they say, well, if I need a hotel, I go to Booking. And if I need a vacation rental, I go to company XY or Z. The markets have traditionally been very different because of the nature of the markets were very different. But more and more, over time -- and I think we're partly shaping that and I believe that's ultimately going to be the outcome, but the markets get a little bit mixed because the person says, ""Hey, I'm going to Barcelona or I'm going to Rio de Janeiro, and I need to find a place to stay."" It's a very common question asked, where am I going to stay. And relative to that scenario, we want to provide them an option. And that option -- by having more optionality in that, you can drive incrementality because the person may not find quite the right thing on a site that has a more narrow set of options. But on our broad set of options, maybe they have a certain price range and a certain thing they're looking, we'll be able to satisfy that. Or in a market like San Francisco or New York, if ADRs and hotels are really high, maybe a business person ends up in an apartment. Or if you've got a big event on like the World Cup or the Olympics where everything gets sold out, having all of this incremental supply offers more beds that people can sleep in. So I think about it today -- if today the market is very different between the vacation rental buyer and the hotel buyer, over time that will only coalesce to become a more similar market because all it is, is human beings looking for a place to stay. And I think that's generally the case that we're seeing on our site. Now certainly, vacation rental space are generally bigger groups, they're generally longer length of stay, slightly higher ADR, relatively good take rate. There's all these fundamentals that reflect the market of today. But I do believe that those things will continue to change. And I think if they could just -- like B&Bs used to be a very different thing than hotels, I think, over time, accommodations will become more similar than less similar because it's the same customer."

In terms of take rates, just with what we believe to be one of the lowest cost distribution alternatives for our accommodation partners. We feel like that's stable for the long run. And then in terms of advertising, we talked about offline advertising. Over the long run, we should see stable to margin leverage there. As we end up spending in the markets we want to spend at the levels we want to spend, we could see pressure from a time to time as we enter a new market or we increase our spending in a market. But over the long run, we should have leverage there. The online advertising is a big variable. It's very hard to predict. But the OpEx is much more under our control, and we've had a good track record there over many years. So we feel comfortable that over the long term, we can have operating leverage in that line item. For Q3 and Q4, it is largely that we're lapping the acquisition of OpenTable and the acquisitions we made in the BookingSuite area. But as we've seen from time to time in the past, we have some lumpiness in the investments that we make in the core business. So in the early part of the year, we typically ramp up our customer service teams, our hotel teams to get ready for peak travel season, and then we see leverage in that line item. Over the long run, I think we'll continue to see leverage there."

Thanks, Kevin. So at the highest level, I think, for those who follow this, we worked with the competition authorities in France, Sweden and Italy, came to an agreement on what we call a Narrow MFN, which basically allows us to keep parity with the hotel's website. And Expedia has also agreed to that. We've had a number of countries come out formally, Austria, Denmark, saying they agree to us. Many others informally have dropped their cases against us. We've got 1 challenge in France, a law that's come out banning parity, which we weren't consulted on or anything, but will come into effect. We, of course, will follow the law. But I think the basic bottom line to understand in this whole discussion, we will never charge our customers more. You can't say it clear enough, we will never charge our customers more. So we will adjust to whatever environment it is, and we'll make sure that we get the best pricing for our customer. And in some case, we have so much innovation we could do to make sure our customers don't get shown prices that are uncompetitive. And that's -- I don't believe the new law in France is good for consumers. I don't think it's good for the French tourism. I don't think it's good for small properties in France. I actually think it's quite negative, but it is what it is, and we will adjust our model. And our business in France is really strong, both from a booker's standpoint as well as bookings coming into France. So it doesn't concern me too much other than just a lot of time invested in this whole area. And I strongly believe it's -- I mean, parity was an invention of the hotel industry. So I strongly believe it's a good way that all travel should be sold on a basis where customers don't spend too much time searching, and that they decide which channel from an agnostic standpoint that they want to buy through. But we're more than ready to compete under any set of standards and hope that the Narrow MFN will be accepted more broadly across Europe.

The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $15 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 113 million room nights in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting slight acceleration for the second consecutive quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $12.45, down slightly versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.85 per share and our guidance for the quarter.  
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were, again, impacted substantially by the strong dollar. 
Our International business recorded 30% gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis, up from 29% last quarter. Booking.com continues to benefit from further penetration of its existing partner relationships as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has about 707,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 35% over last year, including 313,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties.
Vacation rental properties grew 62% year-over-year, and now represent 1.7 million rentable units within these properties. In the last 12 months, about 50 million room nights for vacation rental properties were booked on Booking.com and Villas.com, up 39% year-over-year. This quarter, we began experimenting with self on-boarding of individually owned vacation rental properties, subject, of course, to a set of quality checks on our side and the ability of the property to be instantly bookable.
We already have an encouraging pipeline of vacation rental properties to activate via this channel, and we're hopeful that this functionality will help us scale our property acquisition even further.
BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform, is off to an impressive start and continues to exceed our expectations with strong demand and streamlined execution by our teams. We also added to our BookingSuite offering in Q2, with the acquisition of PriceMatch, a simple cloud-based tool that uses big data to help our partners improve their properties' production through enhanced revenue management.
International results also benefited from Agoda.com and rentalcars.com. Agoda delivered a solid quarter consistent with Q1, with special attention to the collection of private sale deals for its logged-in customers. Strong momentum continued at rentalcars.com, which accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row. Furthering its lead as the world's largest dedicated site for multi-supplier rental car reservations.
Priceline.com continues to be a tale of two cities with strong retail performance, offset by its shrinking, but still large, Name Your Own Price business. The priceline.com management team is making targeted investments as part of its plan to drive innovation into its business and to solidify its position as the best site for travel deals in North America. There's a new level of energy at the company, and we expect great things in the coming quarters.
KAYAK delivered an exceptional bottom line performance in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations, while OpenTable continued to produce double-digit domestic diner growth. After some amount of work to transition its underlying B2B and B2C infrastructure, it's on track to begin launching new international markets later this year.
We took some steps in the quarter to further expand our growth in Latin America. Booking.com launched a TV advertising campaign in Brazil, while the group invested $60 million in a minority stake in Hotel Urbano, one of Brazil's largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. Our investment includes an exclusive commercial partnership, whereby, we will provide Hotel Urbano customers access to accommodations outside of Latin America. 
Finally and importantly, it is worth commenting on mobile. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this trend. Today, as a group, about 1 of 3 bookings of hotels, rental cars and restaurants happens on a mobile device. At current run rate, this will be more than half of our business in only 2 to 3 years. On a Sunday, just a week back, we completed 300,000 transactions, gross of cancellations on mobile at Booking.com for the first time. All of our brands are investing heavily in making our products relevant to consumers across all their screens in a connected fashion and in ways that are industry-leading.
Since the end of Q1, we repurchased about $1.35 billion of our common stock and have an authorization of $1.4 billion remaining for future quarters.
The group performed well in the second quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We'll continue Booking.com's successful foray into brand advertising in certain international markets, and invest aggressively in online variable channels to profitably build our book of business for the seasonally strong third quarter. We remain committed to striking the right balance between top line growth and bottom line profitability, and you will see, in particular, more stability in non-advertising OpEx percentage in the second half as we anniversary the OpenTable and BookingSuite investments.
We believe we are making the smart and sustainable investments today that will extend our lead as the world's largest online travel business for years to come, while also delivering healthy returns for our shareholders today.
I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. 
I will now turn it over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials."
33254,306770205,850212,"The Priceline Group Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported res",1947,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015.
We've talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted by extreme currency volatility, because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, were weaker by about 19% and 9%, respectively, for Q2 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar in Q2 relative to last year.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q2, Q3 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.
The Priceline Group performed well for all these key metrics in Q2. Accelerating unit growth, paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in overperformance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line.
Room night growth was strong in Q2 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 26% in the second quarter, accelerating slightly compared to the 25% growth rate for Q1. Rental car days grew by 20% in Q2, also accelerating compared to Q1 growth of 18%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q2 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I've just discussed.
While we were in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, our growth expressed in constant currency gives a truer picture of our fundamental business performance. And it is more in line with what you would expect based upon our strong unit growth and constant currency ADR growth.
Specifically, our Q2 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 11% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis and by only about 12% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business grew by 1%. 
Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower airfares impacted retail air gross bookings growth, but have no impact on gross profit.
Gross profit for the quarter was $2.1 billion, and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated a gross profit of $1.8 billion, which grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by 8% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $303 million, which represented 32% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q2 of about $62 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 37.3% of gross profit for Q2, which is 469 bps lower than last year. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that partly benefits revenue in Q3 when summer travel takes place. 
In addition, as we've highlighted over recent quarters, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of our core travel business to handle future growth. Q2 will also reflect the leverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services, which are currently in investment mode as we invest to plant seeds for future growth.
Operating margins were, however, better than our guidance due mainly to lower-than-forecasted non-advertising OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $805 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $765 million and represents a 1% decrease versus prior year, reflecting the significant foreign currency translation impact with the stronger U.S. dollar.
Non-GAAP net income decreased by 2% and non-GAAP EPS decreased by 1%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $702 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2015, which is about 2% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $53 million in CapEx and repurchased 720,000 shares of our common stock for $849 million in Q2. Thus far in Q3, we repurchased an additional 436,000 shares for $500 million.
We expect to execute the remaining $1.4 billion of our $3 billion common stock buyback authorization at a pace that makes sense based upon the price at which our stock is trading, available cash in the U.S. and potential uses for other uses for such capital.
Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at June 30, 2015, with about $1.9 billion of that balance in the U.S.
During Q2, we entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility has a 5-year term and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost. 
Now for Q3 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our room night growth has been remarkably resilient, ranging between 24% to 27% over the last 4 quarters. Our guidance reflects another strong quarter of growth, but assumes that our growth rates will decelerate, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends.
Our Q3 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.09 per euro and $1.56 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 18% for the euro and about 7% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. 
I highlight that the euro exchange rate is worse than $1.12 rate that prevailed when we last reported and most analysts updated their forecasts. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would've at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and the remainder of the year.  Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q3.
For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant currency basis and by minus 1% to positive 6% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with the prior year.  We expect international gross bookings to grow by 16% to 23% on a constant currency basis and by 0 to 7% in U.S. dollars. 
Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 19% to 26% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. 
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q3. We expect about 160 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, which is a nice improvement from the margin pressure we have seen in the last couple of quarters. The deleverage is mainly attributable to assumed continued pressure for online advertising ROIs, but to a lesser extent than we saw in Q2.
As we indicated on the last couple of earnings calls, margin pressure from non-advertising OpEx diminishes significantly in Q3, and we expect that trend to improve further in Q4. Over the longer term, we expect that our non-advertising OpEx will generally grow more slowly than our gross profit and be a source of operating leverage.
Our forecast implies a 52% operating margin for Q3. The strong operating margins for our business relative to our competitors positions us well to succeed over the long term in a very competitive market. 
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.425 billion and $1.525 billion which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. 
We are targeting non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS of approximately $22.95 to $24.45 per share which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 7% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of about $1.7 billion of share repurchases we have made, thus far, this year.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.84 and $20 -- $22.34 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping matter. Darren mentioned that Booking.com's platform now has over 707,000 hotels and other accommodations, including 313,000 vacation rental properties. In September, we intend to adjust our methodology for reporting property counts to include properties that are contracted with Booking.com, but are not currently available to be booked on our site. 
For example, we will now include properties in our account that are temporarily unavailable on our site because we filled all the rooms allotted to us, or the property is closed seasonally or for renovations. Under the new methodology, we would've reported about 767,000 properties, including about 353,000 vacation rentals. Our prior year property count on a consistent basis is about 549,000 properties, including about 206,000 vacation rentals. We believe this change will remove volatility from our property count reporting and will reflect a more consistent count of our total active partner relationships throughout the year. This is a small, but important adjustment as we continue to add more and more long tail and sometimes seasonal business.
We will now take your questions."

So I think it's important on mobile to -- obviously, there's web-based mobile and there's app-based mobile. And web-based mobile, still largely and traditionally it's through Google and other search engines. And I have to give Google a lot of credit, that's working better and better for us, where web-based mobile is highly converting big base of transactions for us. And it ends up in the hotel space transactions are relatively infrequent. So a pretty significant percentage happen on web-based, particularly customers we've never seen before. Our app-based customers tend to be our more loyal customers. And the place that we build those is mostly from our own property sites. We do go out and buy app downloads, although app downloads don't tend to be very economic because they often get downloaded and then not ultimately used at least in that space. So this is basically the world of accommodations. It's very different for KAYAK and OpenTable, primarily because both of businesses are a much higher frequency business. They're very heavily skewed to app. And the whole business of getting people to use the KAYAK app to check for flights or OpenTable to book restaurants is another dynamic, and both of those businesses focus heavier and can find economics and actually getting downloads and building lifetime value to customers that are app-based. And those app-based downloads, there's a little bit of that, that comes from Google, but a lot has come from new places like Facebook and other partners. On Facebook, specifically, we -- we've been -- we generate most of our demand from basically search or travel. And travel includes everything from TripAdvisor, down to easyJet, and airlines, and trains and other things. So we've always dreamed of a time where we could access demand from any of these big horizontal audiences. Facebook is obviously one, Twitter is another. You can think of WeChat or any of these other things are just being -- or even the big portals, Yahoo!, MSN, as places. But we've always struggled. And I was quite skeptical, but I have to get Facebook a ton of credit. We're finally getting some good business out of Facebook. Most of it is remarketing or remessaging. And we've now talked with senior management at Facebook about how do we get intent out of their network, and that's an area that both us and them are focused and to the degree in which we can crack the code on intent would make Facebook a real serious source of demand for us as a business. And obviously, as a performance marketer, that would be a big deal for Facebook as well. So I'm excited the progress we're making. They're investing a lot of time and energy into it, which I appreciate. And hopefully, by cracking another source of demand, it allows us to also -- to diversify where we spend our money to find hotel customers."

Well, first of all, we started out as being a hotel-only site, but it's been some years now that we have built out other forms of multiroom accommodation. And even in our old -- in the old Booking.com model it even said online hotel reservations was their sub-tag. But starting even 4 or 5 years ago, we started adding B&Bs and we even have treehouses and igloos and stationary boats. And basically, other things that you could book. So for us, we went from being the world's largest online hotel player to now being the world's largest player in online accommodations. So moving into vacation rentals is a very natural thing for us. It's kind of going down the pyramid and ultimately, getting into this self-catered product. And for us, we're building it out in an instantly bookable, verifiable way, which is very different than what, say, a HomeAway or an Airbnb is doing. We've also focused a lot on making sure the customer experience didn't have all the friction. If you can think of booking a vacation home and having to put down a deposit and having multiple e-mail exchanges, and not really knowing you've got the property, not really having the trust, we're doing in much more kind of a peer e-commerce way. Just trying to create it ultimately, like booking a hotel. And through that strategy, we've had to obviously take a lot of friction out of the industry and change the way that players think about that. And it's a lot of work because for a vacation rental owner, you've got to maintain a digital calendar. You can't overbook people. When you say the place is available at a certain price, it has to sell at that price. But slowly, we're seeing the ice start to crack a little bit and starting to see real momentum. And this is a -- this is great news for a vacation rental owner because this market has a lot of demand, and a lot of people really think of vacation rentals as an upgrade. Like if you've got a family or your group and you're, say, going to Barcelona. Instead of getting like 4 hotel rooms, you can get a vacation home on the beach. And you can make your own meals instead of going out to restaurants every night. So this is a very important addition to our business, but there's a lot more work to do. We do have some cooperation with HomeAway, but it's not near the extent that maybe some of our competitors. And we're still talking there. We have a fairly high bar. We don't do on-request bookings. And for us, it has to be truly instant. It can't be ""Okay, I'll let you know in 24 hours."" That doesn't count as instant. And that's been part of the issue, is just keeping a very high bar and keeping our product very pure, so that it fits with our traditional booker base. So far, so good, and I -- and we're only going to do more of it. It wasn't really a jump into a segment. It was more of an evolution down the accommodation pyramid into the sort of the bottom of the pyramid, which is literally millions and millions of single-owner properties around the world both in cities, on beaches, at ski resorts, et cetera. So that's the story there."

I mean it's an amazing business, but it's become less of a percent of our business over time. So we've been working with them across our entire business. Of course, always, first, focused on core search, what are the other things we can do to innovate to get more out of core search. And we've seen some benefit, particularly in mobile web where we work together to try to get more out of mobile web, and that's been I think very successful. But we're also working with the YouTube team, and we're also doing a lot of work on retargeting. So Google kind of sees us as one of their biggest advertisers in the world. So there's -- and we're very technically performance-driven people. So we work closely together to try to get more out of all the various Google engines. Very specifically, hotel price ads is Google's price product. We don't love it because we would rather buy BlueLinx. We don't need all the extra listing, but we do understand. And we have worked a lot with the HPA team to make that a better product. I think when it started out, there were a lot of savings and things shown on HPA. They just weren't real savings. Generally, in meta there's a lot of challenges with showing customers things they're savings when a large majority of the time they're not, its exchange rates, people don't put taxes on, et cetera. It's a real -- it's not the prettiest space. So we've worked hard with them to improve that product. And then recently, as you mentioned, they've launched an instant book product. It's still very early on. We don't love instant book products either because we have a really good process of taking cold customers and turning them into paying customers. So anyone who creates a path that ends up becoming a lower common denominator, that's not good for us because we think we have one of the best booking paths. We have an agency model. We don't even need the credit card in many cases to do bookings. So -- but we're working also with Google on that, not standing away from it and saying, ""Hey, is there a way to make this work for our businesses as well as what you're trying to achieve?"" So it's always been a close, open collaboration, but as I always say, we're going to put our money where it's strategic. We're going to watch this really closely, and we have lots of options on where to spend our money. We look to continue to create more options to find hotel demand in the future."

Well, you have to go across our brands, but we never reveal the exact percentages, but we have a very healthy repeat business. And I would say, across all of our brands, every single brand, the repeat business every year gets stronger and stronger. A lot of that is related to the new multiscreen environment. A lot of that is related to -- we do a lot more business with signed-in accounts. In the early days, when it was a single-screen, you would do transactional business. And every time you booked a hotel or a flight, you have to reenter all your information. But once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name and it leads to like 1-click booking. And as we've gone to more a multiscreen environment, that advantage for an account holder goes up dramatically. If you've ever tried to book an airline ticket on a mobile phone and not have an account, you'll know what I'm talking about. It's not a pleasant experience. But once you have an account, we can fill out the forms, and we can facilitate that. And then you can take your confirmation that maybe you booked on your tablet, and you can show up at the rental counter with the confirmation on your phone. These are all positives that have driven to more increased repeat business and loyalty among our customers. Then our challenge becomes really and has been how do we bring more customers into the franchise, and that's what we use paid marketing for. But generally speaking, our direct business continues to increase, which gives a reflection, generally, of repeat business."

So first of all, in the second quarter, Europe has been very strong. The Eurozone and Southern Europe with a little bit of the ripple of the Grexit and the coming back of Greece. But generally, Europe has been very solid this year. U.S. is strong for U.S. travelers and China inbound. But generally, almost everyone else is a little -- going a little less to the U.S. because of the currency effect. And yes, China outbound continues to be very strong for us, growing at very fast rates. Japan inbound, Taiwan inbound, very strong. Korean inbound, not so strong because of MERS, not something that gets talked about a lot in the United States, but was a real overhang for us. But on the other hand, we had positive comps. Southeast Asia was a much calmer place in Q2 than it was last Q2. If you remember the Malaysian Air crisis, the coup in Thailand, the burning of factories in Vietnam, there are all sorts of things going on, but that's been a positive from a comp basis. And so that's some quarterly commentary, geographically. But specifically, strategically, Latin America, we entered Latin America -- and specific with the Booking.com brand a number of years ago, starting in Argentina moving to Brazil. I would say, this is a year where we've really had a breakthrough in Latin America. We launched our TV ads in Brazil. But really despite the fact that Latin America is not in the greatest economic health right now and the 2 big engines, which are Argentina and most specifically, Brazil, have all kinds of issues. But this is in a year where we've really gotten great traction in the market, maybe passed the tipping point. We have offices now across the region, and that's a real positive. And I think if you go to Latin America now, our aided [ph] brand awareness is quite high. Hotel Urbano, specifically, this is a -- it's actually a site that gets a tremendous amount of traffic but still, it's a bit challenged in converting that traffic, but it has a great management team. We've always been excited about the volume of audience that they have, largely built through social channels. And you can think of this as kind of a mini Ctrip investment. I mean we made an investment in the company, but it was really also to unlock the commercial opportunity. We're like, well, if we're going to help these guys win, let's participate a little bit in that upside. With the commercial opportunity is -- I wouldn't say, it's a make or break for Latin America, but it's a good-sized piece of business that will help bring Latin American-outbound travelers to the rest of the world. I think it also is a reflection of the strength of our portfolio. It's so global that these matchups just make so much sense because the product converts well. It's a great product. It's all translated, and we can take an audience like this, help Hotel Urbano monetize, but also create a great commercial opportunity for us as well."

And that's really our push in the -- on the paid advertising side. On -- the thing that we go out a little bit on a limb in is our brand marketing. We now know that we can get a pretty good return on our brand marketing, but it may not happen immediately. But we've shown that over time, in the markets we've been in for a while, that we can get a better return on our advertising when you add the brand marketing to our performance marketing than the return we got on our performance marketing alone. And we've done a bunch to build it, just a whole bunch of data-driven tools to help us with our media mix. And that's helped us be smarter and data-driven about where and how we spend our brand marketing dollars. So we're building over whatever now has been a couple of years, more and more confidence in our ability to appropriately spend our brand marketing dollars, which obviously is a big growth potential for the company. Booking.com is not a household name. If you go to America, you'd mentioned OpenTable and KAYAK and Priceline before you'd mention Booking. And the ability for us to build the brand and have great performance marketing is still growth potential that's out ahead of us, and we've been working hard and methodically attack that. I would say, our growth is truly sustainable growth because the paid marketing that we're spending is earning us profit, and all the direct business we're coming is earning us, of course, even more profit. So I don't feel like -- as opposed to some geographies, we have positive unit economics on every single transaction. And we've looked to improve that. And any incremental that we're making in marketing generally comes with positive EBITDA. So -- and we're always trying to get as far as we can to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow for our customers without worrying about the percentage of our P&L that gets taken up by marketing. And that's been our general philosophy. Some people may say, ""Well, if you're that far, why don't you go a little bit further?"" And that's always the balance that we're striking on what business do we bring in and do we really truly understand the economics, but always trying to be positive on a transaction-by-transaction basis."

And always the question is, is your advertiser trying to be an OTA? And at the most extreme, being an OTA is really hard work, like 3/4 of our people are in customer service. They're in the field, they're working property by property on pricing and on availability, and it's a business you have to do at scale. And most of our media partners makes a lot of money off of us. On TripAdvisor, we spend more than $1 million a day. So we have to find a place to spend our money and we, of course, don't want to spend it with somebody who's planning on being an OTA. I don't believe that's really what TripAdvisor is trying to do, but we have to make sure that whatever business we participate in is good business and it's business that we can ultimately pay for that will repeat on our platform. So that's why there's a lot of discussion in this area. There's not like a big rainbow for anyone that's in the media business on the other side because they get most of the economics of the transaction anyway. It's not like suddenly, there's a whole bunch more money there. In fact, all there is, is just a lot more cost. If you have to think of -- I could show you my inbox someday at some of the escalations I get of the dirty ocean in Cabo, because the person wants a refund or the flying ants, and it's -- the OTA business sounds very sexy but, in fact, there's a lot of manual work. And that's why there's only a few players who do this work and do it at scale. And by the way, I'd throw Ctrip in here as well. That's why they do it so well. They've got over 10,000 customer service agents who deal with this kind of stuff every day. So we're being good partners. We're leaning in. I frankly think that the instant book path, ultimately, will prove to be cannibalistic. They may help a little bit on mobile, but that's all to be seen. So we're trying to be positive partners in the process, and try to make sure that if that's the way our advertising partners are going, that we can design a path that is a good auction for us and where we can get good business off of it."

When you ultimately do a transaction on mobile, it's a question of what other screens does the customer engage with you on? How did they get to know the brand? And then there's an issue, of course, of can you -- do you have the force through your brand. By having a stronger brand do you get more loyal customers who then, therefore, go a more app-based mobile versus web-based mobile. To me, at the highest level, I think of mobile as a huge positive for a company like ours. For many of our partners, it's tough enough to build a great website. To actually have a multiscreen experience that works with an account. It's a very difficult thing to do. So that's why I think net it's a positive. I don't think it necessarily drives a lot of incremental business for us, it was a little bit, maybe, more last minute, but it's really a shifting in the way that people engage with digital assets. I -- I'm sure marketing mix will change relative to mobile. I've talked previously that more and more business is coming direct. It's a bit of a chicken and egg. Some of that maybe because our mobile business tends to be more direct than our PC-based web business. But again, I think it's all 1 customer and it's all related to the fact that people are living multiscreen lifestyles versus single-screen lifestyles, which I think is a net benefit to us. And ultimately, I think, also leads to more direct account-driven traffic versus purely off of the web transactional traffic. I think the -- I would -- I guess, the last thing I would say, and you certainly see this in China, the impact of mobile and how, like, Ctrip buys their demand. And we've learned so much from that relationship, and I always appreciate all the time I get with James and Jane, but it's amazing how they just buy traffic differently. There are whole marketplaces for apps In China that exist -- that don't exist in the Western world. And how they've built that up is it's quite fascinating and amazing, and I think there's a lot of lessons for us to learn as this environment changes. But yes, most -- today, again, as I said before, most of our app downloads are from our own properties, which means it would have had to find they get some other way in the past. So the more and more of them that use apps in a sticky way, obviously that's great business for us because it's always coming direct by definition and is very profitable."

And in terms of the -- is vacation rentals incremental or not. Our general belief is, first of all, it's 1 customer and either a customer is just a consumer or they're a business person and a consumer, and they take a number of trips every year. And every trip has a different rationale. And if somebody is a hotel booker on 3 other trips, they may be on a trip with their family and become a vacation rental booker. We want to be able to provide all of those instances and all of those scenarios through Booking.com, so they become comfortable with that rather than in the past they say, well, if I need a hotel, I go to Booking. And if I need a vacation rental, I go to company XY or Z. The markets have traditionally been very different because of the nature of the markets were very different. But more and more, over time -- and I think we're partly shaping that and I believe that's ultimately going to be the outcome, but the markets get a little bit mixed because the person says, ""Hey, I'm going to Barcelona or I'm going to Rio de Janeiro, and I need to find a place to stay."" It's a very common question asked, where am I going to stay. And relative to that scenario, we want to provide them an option. And that option -- by having more optionality in that, you can drive incrementality because the person may not find quite the right thing on a site that has a more narrow set of options. But on our broad set of options, maybe they have a certain price range and a certain thing they're looking, we'll be able to satisfy that. Or in a market like San Francisco or New York, if ADRs and hotels are really high, maybe a business person ends up in an apartment. Or if you've got a big event on like the World Cup or the Olympics where everything gets sold out, having all of this incremental supply offers more beds that people can sleep in. So I think about it today -- if today the market is very different between the vacation rental buyer and the hotel buyer, over time that will only coalesce to become a more similar market because all it is, is human beings looking for a place to stay. And I think that's generally the case that we're seeing on our site. Now certainly, vacation rental space are generally bigger groups, they're generally longer length of stay, slightly higher ADR, relatively good take rate. There's all these fundamentals that reflect the market of today. But I do believe that those things will continue to change. And I think if they could just -- like B&Bs used to be a very different thing than hotels, I think, over time, accommodations will become more similar than less similar because it's the same customer."

In terms of take rates, just with what we believe to be one of the lowest cost distribution alternatives for our accommodation partners. We feel like that's stable for the long run. And then in terms of advertising, we talked about offline advertising. Over the long run, we should see stable to margin leverage there. As we end up spending in the markets we want to spend at the levels we want to spend, we could see pressure from a time to time as we enter a new market or we increase our spending in a market. But over the long run, we should have leverage there. The online advertising is a big variable. It's very hard to predict. But the OpEx is much more under our control, and we've had a good track record there over many years. So we feel comfortable that over the long term, we can have operating leverage in that line item. For Q3 and Q4, it is largely that we're lapping the acquisition of OpenTable and the acquisitions we made in the BookingSuite area. But as we've seen from time to time in the past, we have some lumpiness in the investments that we make in the core business. So in the early part of the year, we typically ramp up our customer service teams, our hotel teams to get ready for peak travel season, and then we see leverage in that line item. Over the long run, I think we'll continue to see leverage there."

Thanks, Kevin. So at the highest level, I think, for those who follow this, we worked with the competition authorities in France, Sweden and Italy, came to an agreement on what we call a Narrow MFN, which basically allows us to keep parity with the hotel's website. And Expedia has also agreed to that. We've had a number of countries come out formally, Austria, Denmark, saying they agree to us. Many others informally have dropped their cases against us. We've got 1 challenge in France, a law that's come out banning parity, which we weren't consulted on or anything, but will come into effect. We, of course, will follow the law. But I think the basic bottom line to understand in this whole discussion, we will never charge our customers more. You can't say it clear enough, we will never charge our customers more. So we will adjust to whatever environment it is, and we'll make sure that we get the best pricing for our customer. And in some case, we have so much innovation we could do to make sure our customers don't get shown prices that are uncompetitive. And that's -- I don't believe the new law in France is good for consumers. I don't think it's good for the French tourism. I don't think it's good for small properties in France. I actually think it's quite negative, but it is what it is, and we will adjust our model. And our business in France is really strong, both from a booker's standpoint as well as bookings coming into France. So it doesn't concern me too much other than just a lot of time invested in this whole area. And I strongly believe it's -- I mean, parity was an invention of the hotel industry. So I strongly believe it's a good way that all travel should be sold on a basis where customers don't spend too much time searching, and that they decide which channel from an agnostic standpoint that they want to buy through. But we're more than ready to compete under any set of standards and hope that the Narrow MFN will be accepted more broadly across Europe.

Thank you for joining us before the markets opened this morning in New York. I'm here in Norwalk, Connecticut with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.
Let me point out that due to technical difficulties at NASDAQ, our press release is only available under the Events and Presentations section of our website at pricelinegroup.com, should be over the newswire momentarily.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $14.8 billion, up about 22% on a constant currency basis or about 7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 115 million room nights in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year.
Gross profit was up 12% or about 29% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was also up 12% to $1.6 billion.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $25.35, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $24.21% and our guidance for the quarter.
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again impacted substantially by the strong dollar, and this will continue into Q4, hopefully, abating on a year-over-year comparable basis as we head into 2016. Our International business recorded 25% gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting Strong Momentum on Booking.com. Booking.com's performance benefited from further penetration of its existing partner relationships, as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has over 820,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 38% over last year.
Today, we are releasing data that shows how these properties represent a combined total of 21 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this number, 14.4 million are within our traditional hotel partners, 1.8 million are vacation rentals, for example, apartments, aparthotels, village, chalets and others self-catered products; and the remaining 4.8 million are our other the room unique properties, for instance, B&Bs, guesthouses, ryokans, riads, et cetera. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of the sheer scale of our accommodation platform, by far, the largest directly bookable accommodation flection in the world, and provides a better comparison to some of the other players in our space. And all of these different types of tooms are bookable with the least amount of friction on any platform, all without fees to consumers, and all with instant verification.
We're also helping guests find and book accommodation on Booking.com at unprecedented levels. Since Booking.com's inception in 1996, we have helped more than 1 billion guests find a place to say. And in just the last 12 months, 285 million guests stayed with us. Coincidentally, in 2015, OpenTable will also seat its 1 billion diners well. Two industry-leading double-sided marketplace platforms, providing scaled experiences for users all around the world.
Following our successful launch of BookingSuite, which continues to gain traction in the B2B arena, we recently introduced another important B2B innovation: Booking.com for business. This new offering is geared to both the business traveler and the travel organizer. Our tools and our organizers to link travelers to the company account without losing oversight or to book on their behalf. Spending in the manager budget filters and spending reports, all of the company's hotel reservations can be viewed and managed in 1 place. And best of all, all enrolled Booking.com for business travelers automatically benefit from our rewards program, including closed user group discounts and special benefits in over 100,000 select properties worldwide.
We were aware that Booking.com had become a popular service business travelers and wanted to create an offering that was more tailored to their unique needs. We have high hopes for Booking.com for business, and early results are very encouraging.
Booking.com's direct share of business also continues to grow, reflecting the solid retention of the loyal and satisfied customer base we've accumulated and nurtured over the past decade, as well as the on, off-line advertising were now conducting in 8 major markets around the world.  As our direct business grows, so too does our investment and online paid channels. We are always looking for new sources of demand and ways to diversify our marketing mix. We invest our money in channels where we believe we can build our brand franchise for the long-term, while also earning attractive ROI within the transaction.
Consistent with these tenets, we agreed to participate in TripAdvisor's instant booking platform. Our agreement includes the prominent branding and marquee potential we require to begin participation. As with all of our channels, we'll experiment and optimize with our partners with TripAdvisor, and expect to achieve healthy ROIs while being given the opportunity to bring new customers into our fold for the long-term.
We will also work to make adjustments in a similar instant booking paths we have with KAYAK, and are willing to work with other media owners who adopt similar principles that allow both the media owner and the advertiser an opportunity to promote differentiation in the branded offerings and to grow their businesses.  Testing on TripAdvisor is scheduled to go live this week, starting with a some small sample.
Let me also make a comment on China. First, we fully support the recent M&A activities, specifically regarding Elong and Cunard, led by our investment nacho partner Ctrip. We hope that these will ultimately lead to a more rational market environment inside China.
But outside of our Ctrip relationship, we're not standing still waiting either. For instance, we started 2015 with only 8,000 in China on Booking.com, and now lists over 25,000. We expect this to grow rapidly over time in part with Ctrip's assistance. As well, Chinese customer growth is exceeded the overall growth in our business for many quarters now, and the Chinese are now the primary Eenvoud nationality to many important destinations for us.  The case of China is a good reminder that travel is inherently a nonlocal business, so global scale combined with a win-win partnerships like  we have with Ctrip, are critical for our mutual success.
Some commentary now on the other brands of the Priceline Group. Priceline.com posted modest growth in hotel and rental car reservations and in overall gross profit. With new leadership, we have been busy repositioning and reinvigorating our namesake brand. And a critical platform migration of priceline.com is nearing its final phases, and the team is eager to start innovating in a faster pace as the new text our rolls out in early 2016.
Agoda also had a challenging quarter and was negatively impacted by the August bombing in Bangkok and various currency headwinds. No strangers to challenge, the Agoda team continue to innovate and all aspects of its business and launched in October substantially revamped a mobile app. We are also seeing positive results from recent work to integrate Booking.com agency inventory into Agoda.
Similarly, although we continue to see strong diner growth in OpenTable, the pace of innovation needs to be improved, and we've made a number of management changes as a result. In particular, Christa Corals, OpenTable's interim CEO, has done an outstanding job leading the team through this transition. We remain excited by the growth potential of OpenTable and are confident that the renewed focus will help us get on the right path to capitalize on this tremendous potential.
Moving on to the rentalcars.com and KAYAK. Book brands delivered strong quarters. Rentalcars.com posted solid unit growth despite a tough comp, while KAYAK made some important changes in the way it markets its business internationally and as a result, accelerated on both the top and bottom line.  The group performed well in the third quarter, and we believe our brands are taking the right actions to best maximize our share of their attractive and expanding online marketplaces. Booking.com has established clear global leadership in the online accommodations market, and we plan to continue to profitably invest to improve and extend our services and bring more consumers to our site.
Mobile execution remains a bright spot across our group, and we steadfastly adhere to our formula for earning our customer's loyalty to delivering best-in-class consumer experiences end-to-end and across devices.
I would like to thank our ample user of the road for their hard work and dedication, and delivering terrific performance during our peak summer season.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015.
Throughout 2015, we've seen the strong U.S. dollars significantly impact our U.S. dollar reported results, because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands.
Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 16% and 7%, respectively, for Q3 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar this year in Q3 relative to last year.  The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and Q4.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations. And we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. 
The Priceline Group performed well through all these key metrics in Q3. Room nights about the grew by 22% in the third quarter, decelerating compared to the 26% growth rate for Q2. Rental car days grew by 13% in Q3 compared to Q2 growth of 20%.  Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q3 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by slightly less than 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I've just discussed.
While we are in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.  Specifically, our Q3 gross bookings grew by about 22% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 7% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 25% on a constant currency basis, and by only about 8% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 3%.
Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in our Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower fares -- lower airfares significantly impact the gross bookings growth but have no impact on gross profit growth.
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2.9 billion, and grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated a gross profit of $2.6 billion, which grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to the prior year. 
Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $335 million, which represented 22% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated a total worldwide revenue in Q3 of about $65 [ph] million.  Excluding the beneficial $13.7 million impact of a favorable travel transaction tax ruling in Hawaii, U.S. gross profit grew by 17%.
Our gross profit take rates where broadly stable as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been sustainable due to our position as a lower cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our accommodation partners.
Our highlight for the quarter was operating margin that exceeded our guidance and were slightly better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 53.7% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q3. 
Margins benefited as our marketing teams did a good job driving traffic, with a nice balance between top line and bottom line growth. Margins also reflect the benefit of strong gross profit flow-through.
The combination of 29% constant currency gross profit growth with stable operating margins results in strong bottom line profit performance. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.6 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.25 [ph] billion, and grew by 12% versus prior year, despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Non-GAAP net income increased by 10%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 14%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact our lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2015, which is about 1% above last year, and it's also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $42 million in CapEx, and repurchased 985,000 shares of our common stock for $1.17 billion in Q3. Thus far in Q4, we have purchased about 400,000 more shares of our common stock for $520 million.
Year-to-date through Friday, total cash return to our shareholders is about $2.8 billion.  Our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion at September 30, 2015, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q4 guidance. We often get questions from analysts and investors are trying to understand the size of the accommodation market and our share of remote reservations. Darren just pointed out that the accommodations on our websites have about 21 million rooms. We internally estimate our market share by multiplying this figure by 365, and then dividing the sum into our annual room nights. This math implies a mid-single-digit market share, which I believe, highlights the opportunity for us to continues to grow our share with existing partners while our supply teams also continue to aggressively add new partners.
Our quarter is off to a strong start, as is evidence in our guidance. Our guidance assumes that are growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We have not yet launched our recently announced the advertising placement on TripAdvisor instant book. We are confident that this will be another way for us to reach travelers in a branded fashion with reasonable ROIs.  Our forecast for the quarter assumes that TripAdvisor instant book will not have a significant impact in our top line growth or at efficiency.
Our Q4 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.07 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 13% for the euro and about 4% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
I also highlight that the euro and British pound as well as several other important currencies for our business, including the Brazilian Real the mother Russian ruble and the Australian dollar, have devalued compared to the U.S. dollar since reported earnings in August, and with most analysts last update to their forecasts.  Overall since that point in time, we estimate that foreign exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our Q4 U.S. dollar forecasted results by about 2%.
As a result of exchange rate fluctuations, our gross bookings gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q4. 
Borrowing further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q4. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant currency basis, and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings down by 5% to 10% compared with prior year.  We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis, and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars.
Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant currency basis, and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars.
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q4. We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency and OpEx.
Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, since deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands and to reasonable ROIs. OpEx leverage has improved compared to earlier in the year, as we have lapped the OpenTable and BookingSuite acquisitions.
We are committed to controlling nonadvertising OpEx, and expect that these expenses to generally grow more slowly than our gross profit in the future, although there could be quarterly variations from time to time as we invest to be ready for growth. This cost discipline, together with industry-leading operating margins, allows us to lean in more aggressively when we see opportunities to advertise our brands to drive growth.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $710 million and $760 million, which at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year.  We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. 
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 17%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S.  We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $11.90 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 6% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 50.9 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price, and reflects the beneficial impact of the share repurchases we have made thus far this year.  We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.10 and $9.90 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar, between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping item. After reporting Q4, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished due to the relative size of our U.S. business to our consolidated results and because 2 of our 3 U.S. businesses do not have gross travel bookings. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business, to give insight into its performance.
We will now take your questions."

In terms of the difference between the growth rate and room nights and constant currency gross bookings growth versus our constant currency gross profit growth, there's a few things in there. First of all, there is a bit of an acquisition benefit, so we have about 1 percentage point of inorganic growth from the OpenTable acquisition, which benefits gross profit and has no impact on gross bookings. I mentioned for our U.S. business and this partly assess your last question, too -- We had a significant step down, 13% reduction in year-over-year airfares, which dramatically impacts gross bookings for the U.S. business but has no impact on gross profit. And then lastly, and probably, most significantly is just -- we had 2 very strong quarters of accelerating growth for room nights, and we're seeing the benefit of that now flow-through in Q3, together with just a strong performance relative to our forecast for bookings that came over the trend after we gave out guidance and actually checked out in Q3."

And over the course of -- over 12 months, we finally came to an agreement where we think we can achieve that. We also believe we're going to get good ROIs half off of the Ctrip's platform. We think that branding is going to help us. And we also believe that we protected our content. We don't want our content being used to help other people book. We want our content to be used to help us book. I think working with TripAdvisor, we came to a nice -- good compromised agreement that allows us to achieve that. It also helps TripAdvisor in their strategic move to try to do more on mobile and other kind of small screen real estate. So overall, really positive.

Yes, we are, on margin, ROI agnostic across various sources of demand. Of course, there are types of demand that work well for us, where we'll get really how the customer repeat, that we like the way that the channels are working, that we might lean in a little bit more. And then other channels where we may be getting customers, but we don't like the nature of the customer -- they're not repeating in the right fashion, then we'll lean back from that. So right agnostic in that sense. I think the TripAssist's execution is one that we would like to use across other partners. We have been -- we will make some changes in KAYAK. We have been work very closely with Google, with Trivago -- other players. And I don't think it's going to enhance ROIs. I don't think it'll bleed away from ROIs. And we're going to have to watch as these things come together, and we really get used to the consumer behavior, and whether or not this is a channel we will lean into or lean back from.  But overall, we always try to earn money on every transaction regardless, and this will be a net positive from a cash flow standpoint for us, although not extremely material given kind of the size and scale of our business today. And then just some comments geographically. We saw a lot of strength in many areas of the market and we saw earlier in the year -- Japanese inbound, China outbound continues to be very strong. U.K. and U.S. outbound because both had relatively strong currencies, relative to where there they're traveling to. Europe we're seeing some pretty promising trends in southern Europe. Greece had a big issue as you know early in the summer, but Spain and Italy were both big positives for us in the summer. Maybe there's a bit of travel moving around, but most people in the Eurozone, state in Europe -- and many bespoke came to the Eurozone, so it was a very strong summer. And that respect. I'd say, challenges, you have these spot crises going on. We now have this 1 in Egypt. You saw in Tunisia and the Greek crisis. Russia, generally, inbound -- outbound is a challenge. There's a lot of travel going on in domestic Russia, but you guys know that whole story. Southeast Asia had the bombing, and then you had MERS in Korea, those were also negatives in the quarter. But overall, we run a very global mobile and diversified business. So I would say, this is certainly our best summer ever, if you look at just the volume of business we did. The profitability of the business. And we've now been able to our -- business is such that we can take advantage of both the positive and clean-up the negative. And going into Q4, we're feeling pretty good about the overall travel environment. I always remind people that travel is for -- is all of our headlines. People lose security when they see a negative headlines. And when the headlines are generally not negative, they're going to have to be positive, then people will travel, and we continue to see a very positive trends going into Q4 as well."

I call them versus pads where somebody else tries to build the booking path, probably, because with think our booking path is the absolute best in industry. We're an agency model, so we use a credit card as a form of guarantee -- not a form of payment. These are all reasons why these instant book path, at times, have not been as strong of opportunities for us as blue links or META links. On the other hand, there is some benefits in terms of the branding and the marketing and also, the connectedness that we will be showing with TripAdvisor, because when they pick you to do their instant book, they're basically saying, ""Hey, here's a great -- preferred partner to do business with."" And that's positive -- China and us -- as well as on TripAdvisor. I think it's something that we're going to have to see how that works over time.

And we hope in Q1 that'll be fully in place. Paul is leading that business -- has decided to put focus there. Forever, we had sort of 2 stacks running in parallel, and now we'll be able to go under a single stack that'll also increased innovation speed, so people are creating code for 2 different stacks of software. It's not the funnest thing to go through, but we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and we expect hopefully to get some good innovation velocity out of that and certainly, the team at priceline.com is very excited to get through this process."

The -- basically, in vacation rentals, we're building a very different product than what Airbnb has or what HomeAway has. And our whole businesses based on the feature consumer. So it wasn't a strategic move, just a reflection of the way that our business works. And we charge our accommodation partners between 12% and 15% commission, so that's where the take rate is. When you're in a classified ad business, it's more difficult to get that kind of take rate from the accommodation partner. So many players will try to also charge a fee or increase fees to consumers. We certainly believe that having a no free product drives conversion for us so we have a -- we obviously have the benefit of having a digital calendar and an instantly verifiable booking. Even the online bookings on HomeAway are on request, or on Airbnb are on request. So that's the whole process where the consumers both deciding and the property still deciding whether they want the product that they booked. So no, we feel really good about our positioning. It wasn't -- is more just reflective of the way our entire business works on Booking.com. But if you look at the way the competitive landscape is shaping up, we feel great that our product is -- both and the consumer lvoe, but is also -- has the least friction of any other products in the market.  And then our next question on Facebook as a marketing platform, we have been doing more and more business with Facebook. Most of it, though, is in the category or remessaging or retargeting. It's not really in the big sweet spot, which is intent-based based marketing. That's really what search gives you -- is that it is intent-based marketing. Somebody types in, ""I want a hotel in New York."" And then you're responding to that request. So -- but the folks at Facebook very much understand this -- they're working to try to win that kind of business. It's direct business. It's a big price for any marketing channel. And we're also trying to work with other large audience versus -- in Silicon Valley to try to get at that Holy Grail of intent-based marketing. It's really valuable to us as it is to any of them, and we're 1 of the world's best at it. And I feel like its other bit strange -- the advertiser going and working with the media partner to figure these things up, but there's a lot to begin by both. And I look forward to seeing where it goes. I've been really pleased, in particular, with Facebook's cooperation in this area and have engineers, working with engineers which is usually a good sign that they're going to figure out something."

We had never really specifically targeted the business traveler. But we had a pretty good sense that business will start to shop to the platform. We see them using their business e-mail address is the one indication we have. So starting about 2 years ago, we begin to say, ""Okay, how do we address the business traveler better?"" As you notice on our website, we don't have to set up for the tool, but if you say you're traveling on business, we'll highlight hotels that are great for business people. We'll show the review score, adjust from businesspeople. We'll show you amenities that businesspeople care about -- things like free WiFi, breakfast, fitness facility, things like that. That was the beginning of it. And then we start to see that people who marked their bookings as business booking, was going faster than even leisure bookers, so then we built a really lightweight tool that helped the systems book on behalf of business brokers, help them track budgets, things like that. And then we saw another pretty good boost to the business. So yes, 1 out of 5 today, there's various people who think that it should be -- I would say, 1 of the 2 sometime, in the long-term, because the business is basically half of accommodations around the world. There's different reports -- it might be 40%, it might be 60% but it's a wide variance. So we're going to continue to build in this space. But we've seen really positive traction. The benefits of business booking to us are their -- generally, they smooth out seasonality which is nice. I don't cancel as much -- generally higher ADR than leisure bookings. So there's a lot of positive benefits of business bookers. But as I remind people that every business person is a leisure traveler. Not every leisure traveler is a business person. But when you do both kinds of travel, and if you're able to do them on 1 platform, there are a lot of benefits to that. And we, of course, give the tool for free to give customer service for free, which is not the case will auto show imagine companies and support businesses today. So step-by-step, we're optimizing the product, and we're quite optimistic about it for the future."

Well, we -- first of all, it's always worth reminding people, this is a very large market, so you don't -- the competition you don't necessarily see on a day-to-day basis. And most of this market is booked in quite an inefficient way. But when we look at what we call vacation rentals which is our self-catered product, we have an inventory of 1.8 million bookable rooms, that's in the ballpark of what HomeAway and Airbnb have. We may be booking different kinds of of properties, HomeAway's actually quite focused on vacation homes. We're quite heavy in city apartments and things like that. We are also at the end is very heavily in Europe. HomeAway index's -- and Airbnb, quite heavily in the United States. But we feel pretty good about the scale of our business, it's growth. The nature of our booker may be different. They're maybe somebody who's looking for any form of accommodation versus a vacation home, specifically. And this is a really critical market for us in the future. When you think about where we've come from, we came from the hotel space. We've now built a massive amount of inventory in multiroom unique accommodations that one would've technically call hotel, and now we're adding vacation homes. So that's the way we've approached the market. We feel good about our growth. It's quite fast and comfortable. And we're a profitable company, which is quite a difference as well. So we continue to build it out. I'd like the cars that we have, and I'm excited to look forward to where this all ends up. I think in the United States, for sure, there's forward to be done. And we now -- if you look at our total property count, we're right in there with Expedia, if not a little bit more. You can see these on the website. And we're going to continue to build out our unique accommodations portfolio in the United States and places that Americans like to go, that's really high priority for us and a big focus in the coming quarters.
Yes, thanks. Well, I guess that last question. Thank you all very much. It's been the biggest quarter in the history of The Priceline Group.

I'm here in Norwalk, Connecticut with Priceline's Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. Let me point out that due to technical difficulties at NASDAQ, our press release is only available under the Events & Presentations section of our website, pricelinegroup.com. It should be over the newswire momentarily.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $14.8 billion, up about 22% on a constant-currency basis or about 7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 115 million room nights in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Gross profit was up 12% or about 29% on a constant-currency basis. EBITDA was also up 12% to $1.6 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $25.35, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $24.21 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again impacted substantially by the strong dollar, and this will continue into Q4, hopefully abating on a year-over-year comparable basis as we head into 2016. Our international business recorded 25% gross bookings growth on a constant-currency basis, reflecting strong momentum at Booking.com. Booking.com's performance benefited from further penetration of its existing partner relationships as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has over 820,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 38% over last year.
Today, we are releasing data that shows how these properties represent a combined total of 21 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this number, 14.4 million are within our traditional hotel partners; 1.8 million are vacation rentals, for example, apartments, aparthotels, villas, chalets and other self-catered product; and the remaining 4.8 million are other multiroom unique properties, for instance, B&Bs, guesthouses, ryokans, riads, et cetera. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of the sheer scale of our accommodation platform, by far, the largest directly bookable accommodation flection in the world and provides a better comparison to some of the other players in our space. And all of these different types of rooms are bookable with the least amount of friction on any platform, all without fees to consumers and all with instant verification.
We're also helping guests find and book accommodation on Booking.com at unprecedented levels. Since Booking.com's inception in 1996, we have helped more than 1 billion guests find a place to stay. And in just the last 12 months, 285 million guests stayed with us. Coincidentally, in 2015, OpenTable will also sit its 1 billionth diner as well. Two industry-leading, double-sided marketplace platforms providing scaled experiences for users all around the world.
Following our successful launch of BookingSuite, which continues to gain traction in the B2B arena, we recently introduced another important B2B innovation, Booking.com for Business. This new offering is geared to both the business traveler and the travel organizer. Our tools allow organizers to link travelers to the company account without losing oversight or to book on their behalf. Spending can be managed through budget filters and spending reports. All of the company's hotel reservations can be viewed and managed in one place. And best of all, all enrolled Booking.com for Business travelers automatically benefit from our rewards program, including closed user group discounts and special benefits at over 100,000 select properties worldwide.  We were aware that Booking.com had become a popular service for business travelers, and we wanted to create an offering that was more tailored to their unique needs. We have high hopes for Booking.com for Business, and early results are very encouraging.
Booking.com's direct share of business also continues to grow, reflecting the solid retention of the loyal and satisfied customer base we've accumulated and nurtured over the past decade as well as the on/offline advertising we're now conducting in 8 major markets around the world. As our direct business grows, so, too, does our investment in online paid channels. We are always looking for new sources of demand and ways to diversify our marketing mix. We invest our money in channels where we believe we can build our brand franchise for the long term while also earning an attractive ROI within the transaction.
Consistent with these tenets, we agreed to participate in TripAdvisor's instant booking platform. Our agreement includes the prominent branding and marquee potential we require to begin participation. As with all of our channels, we'll experiment and optimize with our partners at TripAdvisor and expect to achieve healthy ROIs while being given the opportunity to bring new customers into our fold for the long term. We will also work to make adjustments in a similar instant booking path we have at KAYAK and are willing to work with other media owners who adopt similar principles that allow both the media owner and the advertiser an opportunity to promote differentiation in the branded offerings and to grow their businesses. Testing on TripAdvisor is scheduled to go live this week, starting with a small sample.
Let me also make a comment on China. First, we fully support the recent M&A activities, specifically regarding Elong and Qunar, led by our investment and commercial partner Ctrip. We hope that these will ultimately lead to a more rational market environment inside China. But outside of our Ctrip relationship, we are not standing still waiting either. For instance, we started 2015 with only 8,000 properties in China on Booking.com and now list over 25,000. We expect this to grow rapidly over time in part with Ctrip's assistance. As well, Chinese customer growth has exceeded the overall growth in our business for many quarters now, and the Chinese are now the primary inbound nationality to many important destinations for us. The case of China is a good reminder that travel is inherently a nonlocal business, so global scale, combined with win-win partnerships, like we have with Ctrip, are critical for our mutual success.
Some commentary now on the other brands of The Priceline Group. priceline.com posted modest growth in hotel and rental car reservations and in overall gross profit. With new leadership, we have been busy repositioning and reinvigorating our namesake brand. A critical platform migration of priceline.com is nearing its final phases, and the team is eager to start innovating at a faster pace as the new tech stack rolls out in early 2016.
Agoda also had a challenging quarter and was negatively impacted by the August bombing in Bangkok and various currency headwinds. No strangers to challenge, the Agoda team continue to innovate in all aspects of its business and launched, in October, a substantially revamped mobile app. We are also seeing positive results from recent work to integrate Booking.com agency inventory into Agoda.
Similarly, although we continue to see strong diner growth in OpenTable, the pace of innovation needs to be improved, and we've made a number of management changes as a result. In particular, Christa Quarles, OpenTable's interim CEO, has done an outstanding job leading the team through this transition. We remain excited by the growth potential of OpenTable and are confident that a renewed focus will help us get on the right path to capitalize on this tremendous potential.
Moving on to the rentalcars.com and KAYAK. Both brands delivered strong quarters. rentalcars.com posted solid unit growth despite a tough comp while KAYAK made some important changes in the way it markets its business internationally and, as a result, accelerated on both the top and bottom line.  The group performed well in the third quarter, and we believe our brands are taking the right actions to best maximize our share of their attractive and expanding online marketplaces. 
Booking.com has established clear global leadership in the online accommodations market, and we plan to continue to profitably invest to improve and extend our services and bring more consumers to our sites. Mobile execution remains a bright spot across our group, and we steadfastly adhere to our formula for earning our customers' loyalty through delivering best-in-class consumer experiences end to end and across devices.
I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication and delivering terrific performance during our peak summer season.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015. Throughout 2015, we've seen the strong U.S. dollar significantly impact our U.S. dollar repor",1888,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015. Throughout 2015, we've seen the strong U.S. dollar significantly impact our U.S. dollar reported results because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands. Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, grew weaker by about 16% and 7%, respectively, for Q3 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar this year in Q3 relative to last year.  
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and Q4. Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on the basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. 
The Priceline Group performed well for all these key metrics in Q3. Room nights booked grew by 22% in the third quarter, decelerating compared to the 26% growth rate for Q2. Rental car days grew by 13% in Q3 compared to Q2 growth of 20%. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q3 2015 were up on a constant-currency basis by slightly less than 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I just discussed.
While we are in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant-currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.  Specifically, our Q3 gross bookings grew by about 22% on a constant-currency basis but by only about 7% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 25% on a constant-currency basis and by only about 8% expressed in U.S. dollars. 
Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 3%. Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in our Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower fares -- lower airfares significantly impact the gross bookings growth but have no impact on gross profit growth.
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2.9 billion and grew by about 29% on a constant-currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated a gross profit of $2.6 billion, which grew by about 29% on a constant-currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $335 million, which represented 22% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated a total worldwide revenue in Q3 of about $65 million. Excluding the beneficial $13.7 million impact of a favorable travel transaction tax ruling in Hawaii, U.S. gross profit grew by 17%. Our gross profit take rates where broadly stable as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been sustainable due to our position as a lower-cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our accommodation partners.
A highlight for the quarter was operating margins that exceeded our guidance and were slightly better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 53.7% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q3. Margins benefited as our marketing teams did a good job driving traffic, with a nice balance between top line and bottom line growth. Margins also reflect the benefit of strong gross profit flow-through. The combination of 29% constant-currency gross profit growth with stable operating margins results in strong bottom line profit performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.6 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.525 billion and grew by 12% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP net income increased by 10%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 14%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2015, which is about 1% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $42 million in CapEx and repurchased 985,000 shares of our common stock for $1.17 billion in Q3. Thus far in Q4, we have purchased about 400,000 more shares of our common stock for $520 million. Year-to-date through Friday, total cash returned to our shareholders is about $2.8 billion. Our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion at September 30, 2015, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q4 guidance. We often get questions from analysts and investors trying to understand the size of the accommodation market and our share of room night reservations. Darren just pointed out that the accommodations on our websites have about 21 million rooms. We internally estimate our market share by multiplying this figure by 365 and then dividing the sum into our annual room nights. This math implies a mid-single-digit market share, which I believe highlights the opportunity for us to continue to grow our share with existing partners while our supply teams also continue to aggressively add new partners.
Our quarter is off to a strong start as is evident in our guidance. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We have not yet launched our recently announced advertising placement on TripAdvisor Instant Book. We are confident that this will be another way for us to reach travelers in a branded fashion with reasonable ROIs. Our forecast for the quarter assumes that TripAdvisor Instant Book will not have a significant impact in our top line growth or at efficiency. 
Our Q4 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.07 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 13% for the euro and about 4% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. I also highlight that the euro and British pound as well as several other important currencies for our business, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the Australian dollar, have devalued compared to the U.S. dollar since we reported earnings in August and when most analysts last updated their forecasts. Overall since that point in time, we estimate that foreign exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our Q4 U.S. dollar forecasted results by about 2%. As a result of exchange rate fluctuations, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q4. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q4. 
For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant-currency basis and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings down by 5% to 10% compared with prior year. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant-currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant-currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant-currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars.
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q4. We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency and OpEx. Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs. 
OpEx leverage has improved compared to earlier in the year as we have lapped the OpenTable and BookingSuite acquisitions. We are committed to controlling nonadvertising OpEx and expect these expenses to generally grow more slowly than our gross profit in the future, although there could be quarterly variations from time to time as we invest to be ready for growth. This cost discipline, together with industry-leading operating margins, allows us to lean in more aggressively when we see opportunities to advertise our brands to drive growth.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $710 million and $760 million, which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. 
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 17%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $11.90 per share, which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 6% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.9 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the share repurchases we have made thus far this year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.10 and $9.90 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping item. After reporting Q4, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished due to the relative size of our U.S. business to our consolidated results and because 2 of our 3 U.S. businesses do not have gross travel bookings. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business to give insight into its performance.
We will now take your questions."

In terms of the difference between the growth rate in room nights and constant-currency gross bookings growth versus our constant-currency gross profit growth, there's a few things in there. First of all, there is a little bit of an acquisition benefit. So we have about 1 percentage point of inorganic growth from the OpenTable acquisition, which benefits gross profit and has no impact on gross bookings. I mentioned for our U.S. business, and this partly answers your last question, too, we had a significant step down, 13% reduction, in year-over-year airfares, which dramatically impacts gross bookings for the U.S. business but has no impact on gross profit. And then lastly and probably most significantly, is just we had 2 very strong quarters of accelerating growth for room nights, and we're seeing the benefit of that now flow through in Q3, together with just a strong performance relative to our forecast for bookings that came over the transom after we gave guidance and actually checked out in Q3."

And we were serving U.S. bookers, not just for booking in the United States but also overseas. So overall, we feel great about our U.S. business, but there's a lot more to do.

We've participated in it, and then there was a proliferation of this concept and various meta partners, let's say, TripAdvisor probably the one taking it on most. So we've stayed out of it mostly as we watched the performance of KAYAK, but we wanted to make sure we had in any future instant book partnership with, first of all, great branding; and secondly, the ability to market to the guests that book on our platform. And over the course of -- over 12 months, we finally came to an agreement where we think we can achieve that. We also believe we're going to get good ROIs off of the TripAssist platform. We think the branding is going to help us, and we also believe that we protected our content. We don't want our content being used to help other people book. We want our content to be used to help us book. And I think working with TripAdvisor, we came to a nice -- a good compromised agreement that allows us to achieve that. It also helps TripAdvisor in their strategic move to try to do more on mobile and other kind of small-screen real estate. So overall, really positive. As I said, you guys will be able to see it very soon. We're beginning to test on small samples this week with TripAdvisor. And I'm now quite excited that this will be a nice new addition to places that we can get branded bookings from across our various marketing partners."

Yes, we are margin, ROI agnostic across various sources of demand. Of course, there are types of demand that work well for us, where we will get really healthy customer repeat that we like the way that the channel is working, that we might lean in a little bit more. And then other channels where we may be getting customers but we don't like the nature of the customer, they're not repeating in the right fashion, then we'll lean back from that. So we're agnostic in that sense. I think the TripAssist execution is one that we would like to use across other partners. We have been -- we will make some changes on KAYAK. We have been working very closely with Google, with trivago, other players. And I don't think it's going to enhance ROIs. I don't think it'll bleed away from ROIs. And we're going to have to watch as these things come together and we really get used to the consumer behavior and whether or not this is a channel we will lean into or lean back from. But overall, we always try to earn money on every transaction regardless, and this will be a net positive from a cash flow standpoint for us, although not extremely material given kind of the size and scale of our business today. And then just some comments geographically. We saw a lot of strength in many areas of the market that we saw earlier in the year. Japanese inbound, China outbound continues to be very strong. U.K. and U.S. outbound, because both had relatively strong currencies relative to where they were traveling to. Europe, we're seeing some pretty promising trends in southern Europe. Greece had a big issue, as you know, earlier in the summer, but Spain and Italy were both big positives for us in the summer. Maybe there is a bit of travel moving around, but most people in the eurozone stayed in Europe, and many people came into the eurozone. So it was a very strong summer in that respect. I'd say challenges, you have these spot crises going on. We now have this one in Egypt. You saw Tunisia, the Greek crisis. Russia, generally inbound, outbound is a challenge. There is a lot of travel going on in domestic Russia, but you guys know that whole story. Southeast Asia had the bombing, and then you had MERS in Korea. Those were also negatives in the quarter. But overall, we run a very global and diversified business. So I would say this is certainly our best summer ever, if you look at just the volume of business we did, the profitability of the business. And we've now been able to -- our business is such that we can take advantage of both the positive and clean up the negative. And going into Q4, we're feeling really good about the overall travel environment. I always remind people that travel is for -- is all about headlines. People lose security when they see negative headlines. And when the headlines are generally not negative, they're going to have to be positive, then people will travel. And we continue to see very positive trends going into Q4 as well."

I mean, there wasn't a lot of dev work that had to happen to make the Instant Book path work. We've been working with TripAdvisor very closely and already have established fees and things like that, so that was not a big cost on our side. Yes, certainly, we -- when we look at all of our sources of paid demand, we're always looking for the right balance. We tend to prefer blue links, I call them, versus paths where somebody else tries to build the booking path probably because we think our booking path is the absolute best in industry. We're an agency model, so we use the credit card as a form of guarantee, not a form of payment. These are all reasons why these Instant Book paths at times have not been as strong opportunities for us as blue links or meta links. On the other hand, there is some benefits in terms of the branding and the marketing and also the connectedness that we will be showing with TripAdvisor because when they pick you to do their Instant Book, they're basically saying, ""Hey, here's a great preferred partner to do business with"" and have a positive shine on us as well as on TripAdvisor. I think it's something that we're going to have to see how that works over time. But I'm actually kind of excited to see that because, in a way, we never really -- in many of our other channels, we don't get that kind of endorsement. But in an Instant Book path, that is one of the positives given that it's a branded path that we're looking forward to. And you guys will be able to see, again, very soon what that looks like, and you'll get a better sense of what I'm referring to."

The -- basically, in vacation rentals, we're building a very different product than what Airbnb has or what HomeAway has. And our whole business is based on no fees for consumer. So it wasn't a strategic move, it's just a reflection of the way that our business works. And we charge our accommodation partners between 12% and 15% commission, so that's where the take rate is. When you're in a classified ad business, it's more difficult to get that kind of take rate from the accommodation partner so many players will try to also charge a fee or increase fees to consumers. We certainly believe that having a no-fee product drives conversion for us, but we have the -- we obviously have the benefit of having a digital calendar and an instantly verifiable booking. Even the online bookings on HomeAway are on request or on Airbnb are on request. So the whole process is where the consumer is still deciding and the property is still deciding whether they want the product that they book. So no, we feel really good about our positioning. It wasn't -- it's more just reflective of the way our entire business works on Booking.com. But if you look at the way the competitive landscape is shaping up, we feel great that our product is both something that consumers love, but is also has the least friction of any other products in the market. And then your next question on Facebook as a marketing platform, we have been doing more and more business with Facebook. Most of it though is in the category of re-messaging or retargeting. It's not really in the big sweet spot, which is intent-based marketing. That's really what search gives you, is intent-based marketing. Somebody types in, ""I want a hotel in New York."" And then you're responding to that request. So -- but the folks at Facebook very much understand this. They're working to try to win that kind of business. It's direct response business. It's a big price for any marketing channel. And we're also trying to work with other large audience versus -- in Silicon Valley to try to get at that Holy Grail of intent-based marketing. It's really valuable to us as it is to any of them, and we're one of the world's best at it. And I feel like it's a little bit strange, the advertiser going and working with a  media partner to figure these things out, but there's a lot to be gained by both. And I look forward to seeing where it goes. I've been really pleased, in particular, with Facebook's cooperation in this area, and we have engineers working with engineers, which is usually a good sign that they're going to figure out something."

For competitive reasons, we don't want to talk about how many contracts or anything, but we have multiples more than when Buuteeq was an independent business. The way it's basically working is our account managers will introduced the concept of websites and other technical solutions to partners and then ask them ""Would you like to hear more?"" And then we have a secondary team that will then speak with a partner about the offerings that we have. We started out with websites. We've now bought a company called PriceMatch out of France, so we're developing business intelligence tools. The ultimate goal of BookingSuite is to have a whole suite of products that meets the needs of accommodation partners in the cloud, and that's what we're building toward. So a lot of innovation happening in the business. I am very happy with where it is. It's not a big contributor to EBITDA or anything at this point, but it's on a good pace and certainly ahead of where I thought it would have been at this point. It's really strategic for us. It's an area that -- getting into the software business scenario, we can build close relationships with our partners, and more to come."

Yes, what we've -- it's funny, we'd never -- before we launched Booking.com for Business, we had never really specifically targeted the business traveler. But we had a pretty good sense that businesspeople were starting to shop to the platform. You see them using their business e-mail address, is the one indication we have. So starting about 2 years ago, we began to say, ""Okay, how do we address the business traveler better?"" As you'll notice on our website, you don't even have to sign up for the tool. But if you say you're traveling on business, we'll highlight hotels that are great for business people. We'll show you the review score just from businesspeople. We'll show you amenities that businesspeople care about, things like free WiFi, breakfast, fitness facility, things like that. That was the beginning of it. And then we started to see that people who marked their booking as business booking was growing faster than even leisure bookers. So then we've built a really lightweight tool that helped the systems book on behalf of business bookers, help them track budgets, things like that. And then we saw another pretty good boost to the business. So yes, 1 out of 5 today -- there's various people who think that it should be, I would say, 1 out of 2 some time in the long term because business is basically half of accommodations around the world. There's different reports, so it might be 40%, it might be 60%, but it's a wide variance. So we're going to continue to build in this space. But we've seen really positive traction. The benefits of business booking to us are they're -- generally, they smoothe out seasonality, which is nice; don't cancel as much; generally higher ADR than leisure bookings. So there's a lot of positive benefits of business bookers. But as I remind people of, every businessperson is a leisure traveler, not every leisure traveler is a business person. But when you do both kinds of travel, and if you're able to do them on 1 platform, there are a lot of benefits to that. And we, of course, give the tool for free, we give customer service for free, which is not the case with a lot of the travel management companies who support businesses today. So step by step, we're optimizing the product, and we're quite optimistic about it for the future."

Of course, every paid marketing partner we have, starting with Google all the way down, has always that threat, and you have to make a really strong balance between the channels you're participating and how you're participating relative to the ROIs. And I think we do a really good job of that every single day, and I believe time will tell.

Well, we -- first of all, it's always worth reminding people, this is a very large market so you don't -- the competition, you don't necessarily see on a day-to-day basis. And most of this market is booked in quite an inefficient way. But when we look at what we call vacation rentals, which is our self-catered product, we have an inventory of 1.8 million bookable rooms. That's in the ballpark of what HomeAway and what Airbnb have. We may be booking different kinds of properties. HomeAway is actually quite focused on vacation homes. We're quite heavy in city apartments and things like that. We're also indexed very heavily in Europe. HomeAway indexes, and Airbnb, quite heavily in the United States. But we feel really good about the   scale of our business, its growth. The nature of our booker may be different. They may be somebody who's looking for any form of accommodation versus a vacation home specifically. And this is a really critical market for us in the future. When you think about where we've come from, we came from the hotel space. We've now built a massive amount of inventory in multiroom, unique accommodations that one wouldn't technically call a hotel, and now we're adding vacation homes. So that's the way we've approached the market. We feel good about our growth. It's quite fast and comparable, and we're a profitable company, which is quite a difference as well. So we continue to build it out. I like the cards that we have, and I'm excited to look forward to where this all ends up. I think in the United States, for sure, there's more work to be done. And we now -- if you look at our total property count, we're right in there with Expedia, if not a little bit more. You can see these on the website. And we're going to continue to build out our unique accommodation portfolio in the United States and places that Americans like to go. That's a really high priority for us and a big focus in the coming quarters.

Let me poi",1382,"Well, thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's Third Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here in Norwalk, Connecticut with Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan. Let me point out that due to technical difficulties at NASDAQ, our press release is only available under the Events & Presentations section of our website, pricelinegroup.com. It should be over the newswire momentarily.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $14.8 billion, up about 22% on a constant-currency basis or about 7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 115 million room nights in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Gross profit was up 12% or about 29% on a constant-currency basis. EBITDA was also up 12% to $1.6 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $25.35, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $24.21 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Our U.S. dollar-denominated growth rates were again impacted substantially by the strong dollar, and this will continue into Q4, hopefully abating on a year-over-year comparable basis as we head into 2016. Our international business recorded 25% gross bookings growth on a constant-currency basis, reflecting strong momentum at Booking.com. Booking.com's performance benefited from further penetration of its existing partner relationships as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has over 820,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 38% over last year.
Today, we are releasing data that shows how these properties represent a combined total of 21 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this number, 14.4 million are within our traditional hotel partners; 1.8 million are vacation rentals, for example, apartments, aparthotels, villas, chalets and other self-catered product; and the remaining 4.8 million are other multiroom unique properties, for instance, B&Bs, guesthouses, ryokans, riads, et cetera. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of the sheer scale of our accommodation platform, by far, the largest directly bookable accommodation selection in the world and provides a better comparison to some of the other players in our space. And all of these different types of rooms are bookable with the least amount of friction on any platform, all without fees to consumers and all with instant verification.
We're also helping guests find and book accommodation on Booking.com at unprecedented levels. Since Booking.com's inception in 1996, we have helped more than 1 billion guests find a place to stay. And in just the last 12 months, 285 million guests stayed with us. Coincidentally, in 2015, OpenTable will also seat its 1 billionth diner as well. Two industry-leading, double-sided marketplace platforms providing scaled experiences for users all around the world.
Following our successful launch of BookingSuite, which continues to gain traction in the B2B arena, we recently introduced another important B2B innovation, Booking.com for Business. This new offering is geared to both the business traveler and the travel organizer. Our tools allow organizers to link travelers to the company account without losing oversight or to book on their behalf. Spending can be managed through budget filters and spending reports. All of the company's hotel reservations can be viewed and managed in one place. And best of all, all enrolled Booking.com for Business travelers automatically benefit from our rewards program, including closed user group discounts and special benefits at over 100,000 select properties worldwide.  We were aware that Booking.com had become a popular service for business travelers, and we wanted to create an offering that was more tailored to their unique needs. We have high hopes for Booking.com for Business, and early results are very encouraging.
Booking.com's direct share of business also continues to grow, reflecting the solid retention of the loyal and satisfied customer base we've accumulated and nurtured over the past decade as well as the on/offline advertising we're now conducting in 8 major markets around the world. As our direct business grows, so, too, does our investment in online paid channels. We are always looking for new sources of demand and ways to diversify our marketing mix. We invest our money in channels where we believe we can build our brand franchise for the long term while also earning an attractive ROI within the transaction.
Consistent with these tenets, we agreed to participate in TripAdvisor's instant booking platform. Our agreement includes the prominent branding and marketing potential we require to begin participation. As with all of our channels, we'll experiment and optimize with our partners at TripAdvisor and expect to achieve healthy ROIs while being given the opportunity to bring new customers into our fold for the long term. We will also work to make adjustments in a similar instant booking path we have at KAYAK and are willing to work with other media owners who adopt similar principles that allow both the media owner and the advertiser an opportunity to promote differentiation in their branded offerings and to grow their businesses. Testing on TripAdvisor is scheduled to go live this week, starting with a small sample.
Let me also make a comment on China. First, we fully support the recent M&A activities, specifically regarding Elong and Qunar, led by our investment and commercial partner Ctrip. We hope that these will ultimately lead to a more rational market environment inside China. But outside of our Ctrip relationship, we are not standing still waiting either. For instance, we started 2015 with only 8,000 properties in China on Booking.com and now list over 25,000. We expect this to grow rapidly over time in part with Ctrip's assistance. As well, Chinese customer growth has exceeded the overall growth in our business for many quarters now, and the Chinese are now the primary inbound nationality to many important destinations for us. The case of China is a good reminder that travel is inherently a nonlocal business, so global scale, combined with win-win partnerships, like we have with Ctrip, are critical for our mutual success.
Some commentary now on the other brands of The Priceline Group. priceline.com posted modest growth in hotel and rental car reservations and in overall gross profit. With new leadership, we have been busy repositioning and reinvigorating our namesake brand. A critical platform migration at priceline.com is nearing its final phases, and the team is eager to start innovating at a faster pace as the new tech stack rolls out in early 2016.
Agoda also had a challenging quarter and was negatively impacted by the August bombing in Bangkok and various currency headwinds. No strangers to challenge, the Agoda team continued to innovate in all aspects of its business and launched, in October, a substantially revamped mobile app. We are also seeing positive results from recent work to integrate Booking.com agency inventory into Agoda.
Similarly, although we continued to see strong diner growth in OpenTable, the pace of innovation needs to be improved, and we've made a number of management changes as a result. In particular, Christa Quarles, OpenTable's interim CEO, has done an outstanding job leading the team through this transition. We remain excited by the growth potential of OpenTable and are confident that a renewed focus will help us get on the right path to capitalize on its tremendous potential.
Moving on to the rentalcars.com and KAYAK. Both brands delivered strong quarters. rentalcars.com posted solid unit growth despite a tough comp while KAYAK made some important changes in the way it markets its business internationally and, as a result, accelerated on both the top and bottom line.  The group performed well in the third quarter, and we believe our brands are taking the right actions to best maximize their share of their attractive and expanding online marketplaces. 
Booking.com has established clear global leadership in the online accommodations market, and we plan to continue to profitably invest to improve and extend our services and bring more consumers to our sites. Mobile execution remains a bright spot across our group, and we steadfastly adhere to our formula for earning our customers' loyalty through delivering best-in-class consumer experiences end to end and across devices.
I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering terrific performance during our peak summer season.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015. Throughout 2015, we've seen the strong U.S. dollar significantly impact our U.S. dollar repor",1886,"Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015. Throughout 2015, we've seen the strong U.S. dollar significantly impact our U.S. dollar reported results because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands. Our 2 most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, were weaker by about 16% and 7%, respectively, for Q3 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar this year in Q3 relative to last year.  
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translated into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and Q4. Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on the basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. 
The Priceline Group performed well for all these key metrics in Q3. Room nights booked grew by 22% in the third quarter, decelerating compared to the 26% growth rate for Q2. Rental car days grew by 13% in Q3 compared to Q2 growth of 20%. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q3 2015 were up on a constant-currency basis by slightly less than 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I just discussed.
While we are in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant-currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit.  Specifically, our Q3 gross bookings grew by about 22% on a constant-currency basis, but by only about 7% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 25% on a constant-currency basis and by only about 8% expressed in U.S. dollars. 
Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 3%. Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in our Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower fares -- lower airfares significantly impact the gross bookings growth but have no impact on gross profit growth.
Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2.9 billion and grew by about 29% on a constant-currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.6 billion, which grew by about 29% on a constant-currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $335 million, which represented 22% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated total worldwide revenue in Q3 of about $65 million. Excluding the beneficial $13.7 million impact of a favorable travel transaction tax ruling in Hawaii, U.S. gross profit grew by 17%. Our gross profit take rates where broadly stable as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been sustainable due to our position as a lower-cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our accommodation partners.
A highlight for the quarter was operating margins that exceeded our guidance and were slightly better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 53.7% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q3. Margins benefited as our marketing teams did a good job driving traffic, with a nice balance between top line and bottom line growth. Margins also reflect the benefit of strong gross profit flow-through. The combination of 29% constant-currency gross profit growth with stable operating margins results in strong bottom line profit performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.6 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.525 billion and grew by 12% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP net income increased by 10%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 14%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2015, which is about 1% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $42 million in CapEx and repurchased 985,000 shares of our common stock for $1.17 billion in Q3. Thus far in Q4, we have purchased about 400,000 more shares of our common stock for $520 million. Year-to-date through Friday, total cash returned to our shareholders is about $2.8 billion. Our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion at September 30, 2015, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. 
Now for Q4 guidance. We often get questions from analysts and investors trying to understand the size of the accommodation market and our share of room night reservations. Darren just pointed out that the accommodations on our websites have about 21 million rooms. We internally estimate our market share by multiplying this figure by 365 and then dividing the sum into our annual room nights. This math implies a mid-single-digit market share, which I believe highlights the opportunity for us to continue to grow our share with existing partners while our supply teams also continue to aggressively add new partners.
Our quarter is off to a strong start as is evident in our guidance. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We have not yet launched our recently announced advertising placement on TripAdvisor Instant Book. We are confident that this will be another way for us to reach travelers in a branded fashion with reasonable ROIs. Our forecast for the quarter assumes that TripAdvisor Instant Book will not have a significant impact in our top line growth or ad efficiency. 
Our Q4 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.07 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 13% for the euro and about 4% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. I also highlight that the euro and British pound as well as several other important currencies for our business, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the Australian dollar, have devalued compared to the U.S. dollar since we reported earnings in August and when most analysts last updated their forecasts. Overall since that point in time, we estimate that foreign exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our Q4 U.S. dollar forecasted results by about 2%. As a result of exchange rate fluctuations, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q4. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q4. 
For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant-currency basis and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings down by 5% to 10% compared with prior year. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant-currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant-currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant-currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars.
We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q4. We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency and OpEx. Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs. 
OpEx leverage has improved compared to earlier in the year as we have lapped the OpenTable and BookingSuite acquisitions. We are committed to controlling nonadvertising OpEx and expect these expenses to generally grow more slowly than our gross profit in the future, although there could be quarterly variations from time to time as we invest to be ready for growth. This cost discipline, together with industry-leading operating margins, allows us to lean in more aggressively when we see opportunities to advertise our brands to drive growth.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $710 million and $760 million, which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 3% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. 
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 17%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $11.90 per share, which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 6% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.9 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the share repurchases we have made thus far this year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.10 and $9.90 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions.
One housekeeping item. After reporting Q4, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished due to the relative size of our U.S. business to our consolidated results and because 2 of our 3 U.S. businesses do not have gross travel bookings. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business to give insight into its performance.
We will now take your questions."

In terms of the difference between the growth rate in room nights in constant-currency gross bookings growth versus our constant-currency gross profit growth, there's a few things in there. First of all, there is a little bit of an acquisition benefit. So we have about 1 percentage point of inorganic growth from the OpenTable acquisition, which benefits gross profit and has no impact on gross bookings. I mentioned for our U.S. business, and this partly answers your last question, too, we had a significant step down, a 13% reduction, in year-over-year airfares, which dramatically impacts gross bookings for the U.S. business but has no impact on gross profit. And then lastly and probably most significantly, is just we had 2 very strong quarters of accelerating growth for room nights, and we're seeing the benefit of that now flow through in Q3, together with just a strong performance relative to our forecast for bookings that came over the transom after we gave guidance and actually checked out in Q3."

And we were serving U.S. bookers, not just for booking in the United States but also overseas. So overall, we feel great about our U.S. business, but there's a lot more to do.

And over the course of -- over 12 months, we finally came to an agreement where we think we can achieve that. We also believe we're going to get good ROIs off of the TripAssist platform. We think the branding is going to help us, and we also believe that we've protected our content. We don't want our content being used to help other people book. We want our content to be used to help us book. And I think working with TripAdvisor, we came to a nice -- a good compromise agreement that allows us to achieve that. It also helps TripAdvisor in their strategic move to try to do more on mobile and other kind of small-screen real estate. So overall, we're really positive.

So we're agnostic in that sense. I think the TripAssist execution is one that we would like to use across other partners. We have been -- we will make some changes on KAYAK. We have been working very closely with Google, with trivago, other players. And I don't think it's going to enhance ROIs. I don't think it'll bleed away from ROIs. And we're going to have to watch as these things come together and we really get used to the consumer behavior and whether or not this is a channel we will lean into or lean back from. But overall, we always try to earn money on every transaction regardless, and this will be a net positive from a cash flow standpoint for us, although not extremely material given kind of the size and scale of our business today. And then just some comments geographically. We saw a lot of strength in many areas of the market that we saw early in the year. Japanese inbound, China outbound continues to be very strong. U.K. and U.S. outbound, because both had relatively strong currencies relative to where they were traveling to. Europe, we're seeing some pretty promising trends in southern Europe. Though Greece had a big issue, as you know, earlier in the summer, but Spain and Italy were both big positives for us in the summer. Maybe there is a bit of travel moving around, but most people in the eurozone stayed in Europe, and many people came into the eurozone. So it was a very strong summer in that respect. I'd say challenges, you have these spot crises going on. We now have this one in Egypt. You saw in Tunisia, the Greek crisis. Russia, generally inbound, outbound is a challenge. There is a lot of travel going on in domestic Russia, but you guys know that whole story. Southeast Asia had the bombing, and then you had MERS in Korea. Those were also negatives in the quarter. But overall, we run a very global and diversified business. So I would say this is certainly our best summer ever, if you look at just the volume of business we did, the profitability of the business. And we've now been able to -- our business is such, we can take advantage of both the positives and clean up the negatives. And going into Q4, we're feeling really good about the overall travel environment. I always remind people that travel is for -- is all about headlines. People lose security when they see negative headlines. And when the headlines are generally not negative, they don't even have to be positive, then people will travel. And we continue to see very positive trends going into Q4 as well."

I mean, there wasn't a lot of dev work that had to happen to make the Instant Book path work. We've been working with TripAdvisor very closely and already have established feeds and things like that, so that was not a big cost on our side. Yes, certainly, we -- when we look at all of our sources of paid demand, we're always looking for the right balance. We tend to prefer blue links, I call them, versus paths where somebody else tries to build a booking path probably because we think our booking path is the absolute best in industry. We're an agency model, so we use the credit card as a form of guarantee, not a form of payment. These are all reasons why these Instant Book paths at times have not been as strong of opportunities for us as blue links or meta links. On the other hand, there is some benefits in terms of the branding and the marketing and also the connectedness that we will be showing with TripAdvisor because when they pick you to do their Instant Book, they're basically saying, ""Hey, here's a great preferred partner to do business with"" and that positive shine on us, as well as on TripAdvisor, I think is something that we're going to have to see how that works over time. But I'm actually kind of excited to see that because, in a way, we never really -- in many of our other channels, we don't get that kind of endorsement. But in an Instant Book path, that is one of the positives given that it's a branded path that we're looking forward to. And you guys will be able to see, again, very soon what that looks like, and you'll get a better sense of what I'm referring to."

The -- basically, in vacation rentals, we're building a very different product than what Airbnb has or what HomeAway has. And our whole business is based on no fees for consumer. So it wasn't a strategic move, it's just a reflection of the way that our business works. And we charge our accommodation partners between 12% and 15% commission, so that's where the take rate is. When you're in a classified ad business, it's more difficult to get that kind of take rate from the accommodation partner, so many players will try to also charge a fee or increase fees to consumers. We certainly believe that having a no-fee product drives conversion for us, but we have the -- we obviously have the benefit of having a digital calendar and an instantly verifiable booking. Even the online bookings on HomeAway are on request or on Airbnb are on request. So there is a whole process where the consumer is still deciding and the property is still deciding whether they want the product that they book. So no, we feel really good about our positioning. It wasn't -- it's more just reflective of the way our entire business works on Booking.com. But if you look at the way the competitive landscape is shaping up, we feel great that our product is both something that consumers love, but is also -- has the least friction of any of the products in the market. And then your next question on Facebook as a marketing platform, we have been doing more and more business with Facebook. Most of it though is in the category of re-messaging or retargeting. It's not really in the big sweet spot, which is intent-based marketing. That's really what search gives you, is intent-based marketing. Somebody types in, ""I want a hotel in New York."" And then you're responding to that request. So -- but the folks at Facebook very much understand this. They're working to try to win that kind of business. It's direct response business. It's a big prize for any marketing channel. And we're also trying to work with other large audience sources in Silicon Valley to try to get at that Holy Grail of intent-based marketing. It's really valuable to us as it is to any of them, and we're one of the world's best at it. And I feel like it's a little bit strange, the advertiser going and working with a  media partner to figure these things out, but there's a lot to be gained by both. And I look forward to seeing where it goes. I've been really pleased, in particular, with Facebook's cooperation in this area, and we have engineers working with engineers, which is usually a good sign that they're going to figure out something."

Yes, well we've -- it's funny, we'd never -- before we launched Booking.com for Business, we had never really specifically targeted the business traveler. But we had a pretty good sense that business people were starting to show up to the platform. You see them using their business e-mail address, is the one indication we have. So starting about 2 years ago, we began to say, ""Okay, how do we address the business traveler better?"" As you'll notice on our website, you don't even have to sign up for the tool. But if you say you're traveling on business, we'll highlight hotels that are great for businesspeople. We'll show you the review score just from businesspeople. We'll show you amenities that businesspeople care about, things like free WiFi, breakfast, fitness facilities, things like that. That was the beginning of it. And then we started to see that people who marked their booking as a business booking was growing faster than even leisure bookers. So then we built a really lightweight tool that helped assistants book on behalf of business bookers, helped them track budgets, things like that. And then we saw another pretty good boost to the business. So yes, 1 out of 5 today -- there's various people who think that it should be, I would say, 1 out of 2 some time in the long term, because business is basically half of accommodations around the world. There's different reports, it might be 40%, it might be 60%, but it's a wide variance. So we're going to continue to build in this space. But we've seen really positive traction. The benefits of business bookings to us are they're -- generally, they smoothe out seasonality, which is nice; don't cancel as much; generally higher ADR than leisure bookings. So there's a lot of positive benefits of business bookers. But as I remind people of, every businessperson is a leisure traveler, not every leisure traveler is a businessperson. But when you do both kinds of travel, and if you're able to do them on 1 platform, there are a lot of benefits to that. And we, of course, give the tool for free, we give customer service for free, which is not the case with a lot of the travel management companies who support businesses today.

Every now and then, there'll be a step down, maybe a little bit bigger than what we were anticipating. And then at other points, there'll be a quarter where we accelerate. But overall, we're pleased with the performance year-to-date and in the third quarter, specifically."

On the TripAdvisor thing, I think I've largely answered this. Obviously, it's a very tricky area. And what we would never want to do is be a dumb pipe to somebody else's brand, and we would never want to give our content away to somebody to book other people's bookings. And you'll see that we've done neither of those. So I feel great about where we came out at, and time will tell. Of course, every paid marketing partner we have, starting with Google all the way down, there's always that threat, and you have to make a really strong balance between the channels you're participating and how you're participating relative to the ROIs. And I think we do a really good job of that every single day, and I believe time will tell. I also, by the way, think it's great for TripAdvisor, and that's kind of the nature of partnership, is they've got something that they need to achieve, we've got something we need to achieve. And there was opportunity to come up with an answer, and that's what we did. So let's see. I mean, we will -- the best thing to do in these situations is find a good way to get in and begin experimenting and optimizing. And ultimately, we both win if we can find a way to get a lot more bookings."

TripAdvisor is obviously a big player for us, but they're still a -- overall, a small percentage of our overall business.

And so when you don't have that kind of deceleration in top line growth, that puts a little bit more pressure on the ad efficiency metric. In terms of  the U.S. gross bookings, I'd say that the best way to look at our U.S. business and understand the trends will be the revenue and gross profit numbers that we'll continue to report.

Well, we -- first of all, it's always worth reminding people, this is a very large market so you don't -- the competition, you don't necessarily see on a day-to-day basis. And most of this market is booked in quite an inefficient way. But when we look at what we call vacation rentals, which is our self-catered product, we have an inventory of 1.8 million bookable rooms. That's in the ballpark of what HomeAway and what Airbnb have. We may be booking different kinds of properties. HomeAway is actually quite focused on vacation homes. We're quite heavy in in-city apartments and things like that. We're also indexed very heavily in Europe. HomeAway indexes, and Airbnb, quite heavily in the United States. But we feel really good about the   scale of our business, its growth. The nature of our booker may be different. They may be somebody who's looking for any form of accommodation versus a vacation home specifically. And this is a really critical market for us in the future. When you think about where we've come from, we came from the hotel space. We've now built a massive amount of inventory in multiroom, unique accommodations that one wouldn't technically call a hotel, and now we're adding vacation homes. So that's the way we've approached the market. We feel good about our growth. It's quite fast and comparable, and we're a profitable company, which is quite a difference as well. So we continue to build it out. I like the cards that we have, and I'm excited to look forward to where this all ends up. I think in the United States, for sure, there's more work to be done. And we now -- if you look at our total property count, we're right in there with Expedia, if not a little bit more. You can see these on the website. And we're going to continue to build out our unique accommodation portfolio in the United States and places that Americans like to go. That's a really high priority for us and a big focus in the coming quarters.
Yes, thanks. Well, I guess that's the last question. Thank you all very much. It's been the biggest quarter in the history of The Priceline Group. But we continue to be very optimistic about the future. And again, I want to thank all of our employees for a fantastic summer, and looking forward to a great 2016."
