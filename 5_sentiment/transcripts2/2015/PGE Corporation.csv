I've had the pleasure of meeting some of your earlier this year, and I look forward to working with all of you in the future. 
Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management work. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review the 2014 annual report on Form 10-K that will be filed with the SEC later today, including the discussion of risk factors.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony."

And I feel really good about the significant accomplishments that we've had in our operations. There's no question that our system is safer and more customers are experiencing greater reliability now than they ever had in the past. And proof of this is in our customer satisfaction scores. 
I've always believed that strong operations are the foundation for longer term financial success and we're working hard to deliver on both fronts. Chris will tell you more about our operational results in a moment. And then Kent will go through the financials. 
In addition to the great progress we've made operationally, I want to acknowledge the setbacks we had last year related to communications between the company and our regulators. As you know, we took quick and decisive action making it clear to our employees and the public that noncompliance has no place in our organization. And with the help of outside experts, we're establishing a best-in-class compliance program. I also want to acknowledge that we still don't have a final resolution in the Gas Transmission investigations.
With the proposed decision issued last September, we believe the commission has all the information it needs and we hope to see a final decision soon.
Now as we look ahead, with the resolution of the General Rate Case last year, we are positioned to continue investing in our gas and electric systems. We plan to build on our progress over the past few years by continuing to upgrade our gas and electric infrastructure, and leverage technology to enhance performance and modernize the grid. 
Over the next few years, we expect our capital spending to be more than $5 billion a year. And we're optimistic about PG&E's growth opportunities. We plan to continue to take advantage of our location near Silicon Valley to help design and build the grid of the future, or as we've been calling it, the Grid of Things, where distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy storage and other technologies are integrated into a two-way power grid.
Governor Brown recently set out ambitious goals for California to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030. We believe these policies are in line with our own strategies on clean energy, vehicle electrification and energy efficiency, and look forward to working with policymakers to develop and implement these new standards.
In fact, yesterday, we filed an application at the CPUC to invest $500 million over 5 years in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which we believe is critical for EV adoption and greenhouse gas reduction. We're glad that CPUC has recognized that the utilities are important players in the electrification of transportation sector, and we're eager to get our program approved and underway.
So with that, let me now turn it over to Chris."

And then touch on some additional regulatory development from the quarter and the year. 
As Tony mentioned, we had a really strong operational results in 2014. Starting with safety, we're extremely proud of our performance on key public safety metrics such as gas odor response time, 911 response and third-party dig-ins. For example, last year, PG&E employees responded to gas emergency calls in an average of less than 20 minutes, which represents one of the fastest response times in the industry.
In terms of electric reliability, 2014 was our sixth straight year of record performance for outage duration and our customers experienced the fewest outages in company history. We also opened our first of 3 state-of-the-art electric distribution control centers last year, integrating leading technology to further improve operations. 
In terms of electric supply, we continue to make good progress on our goal of 33% qualified renewables by 2020. And last year, our electric supply portfolio was more than 50% greenhouse gas free, making us one of the cleanest utilities in the country.
On the gas side, we're especially proud of the international certifications we've received for our asset management practices. Not only did we received the initial certifications from Lloyd's registered in May, but in November, we were recertified after an extensive follow-up on it, which validated the sustainability of our program. We're 1 of only a few utilities in the world to achieve these certifications. 
Also in gas last month, we announced that we've now completed our systemwide cast iron pipe replacement program, making our gas system even safer. And you can see on the slide, the extensive work we completed on strength testing, valve automation and pipe replacement.
Now all of this work is being acknowledged by our customers. Our customer satisfaction results in 2014 were the highest we've seen since 2009, which is before the San Bruno accident. While we're proud of all these achievements, we know we have more work to do. And we'll continue to look for, find and fix areas that need improvement.
Moving onto our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or our PSEP, we've completed the majority of the planned expense work in PSEP, although a small amount of work will continue to this year. And Kent will cover how this fits into our 2015 plans.
On the capital side of the program, the last part of the PSEP has proven to be very challenging. Late last year, we determined that the permitting and routing for a number of the remaining pipeline replacement projects, including some in environmentally sensitive areas, will be more difficult than we previously expected. So we now expect to work to be more costly and will be completed over the next few years, which is longer than we had originally anticipated.
Since the PSEP program has a cap on the recovery of capital, we took a charge of $116 million in the fourth quarter for these higher expected costs.
Shifting to regulatory matters. The hearings in the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case started last week and are expected to conclude this month. The current schedule calls for a final decision in August with revenues retroactive to January 1 of this year. As a reminder, the final decision on the order to show cause related to ex parte communications in the gas transmission rate case call for a disallowance of up to 5 months of the increase in the authorized revenue.
As you know, we've appealed that portion of the decision. 
In other regulatory matters, in December, the commission approved an incentive award for our energy efficiency program. And our cost of capital medicine was extended for another year. It will now be in place through the end of 2016. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

As usual, I plan to go through our Q4 results. And now I'll provide some insights about our 2015 outlook. Slide 5 shows our results for Q4 and full year 2014.Earnings from operations came in at $0.53 for the quarter and $3.5",1432,"Thank you, and good morning. As usual, I plan to go through our Q4 results. And now I'll provide some insights about our 2015 outlook. Slide 5 shows our results for Q4 and full year 2014.
Earnings from operations came in at $0.53 for the quarter and $3.50 for the year. GAAP earnings including our items impacting comparability are shown here as well. We've got the details regarding the natural gas item in the table at the bottom at pretax dollars. Our pipeline related expenses came in at $102 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year which was just below our guidance range. As Chris mentioned, a modest amount of PSEP related expense work will spill over into 2015.
Next is the disallowed capital write-off for PSEP of $116 million related to the higher cost to complete the remaining PSEP capital work. Because there's a cost cap in place, we wrote off those cost that we anticipate will come in above the cap.
On the next line, you'll see that were recorded $12 million of fines, mainly for the gas distribution accident in Carmel last March. We believe that fine is excessive and we've requested a rehearing.
We adjusted our third-party liability claims related to San Bruno down by $7 million as a result of settling the last few claims in Q4. That leaves our total loss at $558 million versus our previous estimate of $565 million.
Finally, we booked $26 million in insurance recoveries in the quarter for a total of $112 million for the year.
Slide 6 is the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. And you've seen many of these same drivers in previous quarters. The first 3 items relate primarily to 2014 -- to the 2014 General Rate Case and they totaled $0.19. I'm just going to go through each of them briefly. First, as a result of the GRC decision, our expense recovery increased $0.08 quarter-over-quarter. This represents the impact of recovering higher levels of spend that were not being recovered in 2013.
Second, we had a positive $0.06 resulting from tax benefits related to our federal tax deduction for repairs cost. 
Third, we've recorded earnings on a higher authorized rate base, this totaled $0.05. As you see, we also have some smaller positive items in the quarter, a pick up on some regulatory matters, the absence of some project and lease charges experienced in the prior year and vice other items included in miscellaneous.
These positives were partially offset by a $0.14 timing item, related to taxes and operating expenses that was driven mainly by the delay in our General Rate Case. You may remember this from last quarter's call. In Q4, this item turned around as expected, reversing out the impact experienced earlier in the year.
Finally, our share dilution came in at $0.02 negative quarter-over-quarter.
Now I'd like to provide a few thoughts about our future performance. Since we're still awaiting resolution in the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC, we're not providing guidance today for 2015 earnings. However, we are providing key assumptions for earnings from operations and items impacting comparability to help you understand our profile.
If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see some key assumptions for 2015 earnings from operation. First in the upper left, you see were assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year. The breakdown by line of business is included here as well. In the upper right, you'll see that our estimated -- our estimate the weighted average of right rate base is about $31 billion. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with range as we previously provided, so no real change there. 
In the lower left, you'll see that they're also are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective for EFO is to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
Many of these should look familiar from last year, and I'll briefly touch on them in reiterate what told you about them. In terms of the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case, the first is to just a reminder that the outcome of the case is not known at this stage. So we have some uncertainty regarding the impact on 2015 result. The second bullet under the gas transmission case is also a reminder that we've not sought recovery of some operating expenses in 2015 and beyond. These are for certain corrosion and strength testing work. We previously indicated that these expenses taken together should average $50 million annually over the 3-year period. Although the amount may vary year-to-year.
Next is the tax benefits associated with the repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was almost a quarter and we've indicated that we expected to be a similar order of magnitude in 2015.
The next 2 factors, incentive revenues and monetizing SolarCity shares you saw last year as well. In terms of SolarCity, we said that about 2/3 of this year were monetized in 2014. As a result, you should expect a smaller impact this year than last.
Finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by the below the line cost. So these include advertising, veritable contribution, environmental cost and so forth.
Before I move onto the next slide, I want to make one more point. We won't receive a final decision on the gas transmission rate case until at least the third quarter based on the current schedule. Because the decision will be retroactive to January 1, the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operation that it will have an impact on our reported results just as you so that we General Rate Case last year.
Okay, turning to Slide 8. You'll see our assumptions for items impacting comparability in 2015. Our framework for 2015 will have 3 components: pipeline related expenses; legal and regulatory related expenses; and fines and penalties. I'll walk you through each of these.
First, we're providing an estimated range for pipeline related expenses of $100 million to $150 million, which represents a significant reduction from prior years.
The majority of the dollars here are for clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We are now beginning to figure that program, which we have estimated the cost of up to $500 million from its inception in 2013 through its plan completion in 2017.
The range for pipeline-related expense also includes a smaller amount, roughly $25 million to the PSEP expense that was carried over from last year.
Second is legal and regulatory related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million for the year. 
Here, we've consolidated all legal and other cost expected to be incurred and in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communication.
Third, our professional fines and penalties. Again, limited to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications. For example, this would include resolution of the gas pipeline investigation by the CPUC. It would also include gas transmission rate case revenue disallowed by the CPUC as a penalty for ex parte communication. Assess been our practice in the past, we have providing for guidance for fines and penalties in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 9, we assume equity issuance of $400 million to $600 million in 2015, that compares to equity issuance last year of $827 million. This range is consistent with the other assumptions I've provided this morning, including our CapEx profile and our items impacting comparability, in essence we received a reasonable outcome in our gas transmission rate case.
Importantly, the range does that reflect additional fines or penalties in connection with natural gas matters or regulatory communication. Those would be incremental to this range.
Finally, Slides 10 and 11 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016, and these are consistent with what we've shown you previously. Our total CapEx is expected to remain well above $5 billion annually during this period. Our average rate base is expected to grow to more than $33 billion in 2016, representing about a 9% CAGR over 2014.
We anticipate providing you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall. 
All in with that, and we'll open up the lines for your question."

We think that a clean energy standard that gives us some flexibility going forward makes sense. But in any event, even assuming we're going to be continuing to develop our renewable portfolio, most of the renewables now are part of our purchase cover portfolio. We did do some utility on Solar, early on, decided that wasn't a strength for us. So I would anticipate that in the future as our renewables go up, it just will flow through our purchase power accounts rather than being investment in capital. Although we continue to look at new technologies, what it will do is renewables go up, that would becomes more complex to manage. And as Chris said in a number of speech, if that's our investment opportunity to invest in going from the traditional one-way full power and unpredictable to flow power in that is not as predictable, and that's going to be where we think there was opportunities."

2014 was a strong year for us. And I feel really good about the significant accomplishments that we've had in our operations. There's no question that our system is safer and more customers are experiencing greater reliability now than they ever had in the past. And proof of this is in our customer satisfaction scores.
I've always believed that strong operations are the foundation for longer term financial success and we're working hard to deliver on both fronts. Chris will tell you more about our operational results in a moment, and then Kent will go through the financials.
In addition to the great progress we've made operationally, I want to acknowledge the setbacks we had last year related to communications between the company and our regulators. As you know, we took quick and decisive action, making it clear to our employees and the public that noncompliance has no place in our organization. And with the help of outside experts, we're establishing a best-in-class compliance program. I also want to acknowledge that we still don't have a final resolution in the gas transmission OII investigations.
With the proposed decision issued last September, we believe the commission has all the information it needs and we hope to see a final decision soon.
Now as we look ahead, with the resolution of the General Rate Case last year, we are positioned to continue investing in our gas and electric systems. We plan to build on our progress over the past few years by continuing to upgrade our gas and electric infrastructure and leverage technology to enhance performance and modernize the grid.
Over the next few years, we expect our capital spending to be more than $5 billion a year, and we're optimistic about PG&E's growth opportunities. We plan to continue to take advantage of our location near Silicon Valley to help design and build the grid of the future, or as we've been calling it, the Grid of Things, where distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy storage and other technologies are integrated into a two-way power grid.
Governor Brown recently set out some ambitious goals for California to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030. We believe these policies are in line with our own strategies on clean energy, vehicle electrification and energy efficiency and look forward to working with policymakers to develop and implement these new standards.
In fact, yesterday, we filed an application at the CPUC to invest $500 million over 5 years in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which we believe is critical for EV adoption and greenhouse gas reduction. We're glad the CPUC has recognized that the utilities are important players in the electrification of the transportation sector, and we're eager to get our program approved and underway.
So with that, now, let me turn it over to Chris."

As you can see on Slide 4, I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments from the quarter and the year.
As Tony mentioned, we had a really strong operational results in 2014. Starting with safety, we're extremely proud of our performance on key public safety metrics such as gas odor response time, 911 response and third-party dig-ins. For example, last year, PG&E employees responded to gas emergency calls in an average of less than 20 minutes, which represents one of the fastest response times in the industry.
In terms of electric reliability, 2014 was our sixth straight year of record performance for outage duration and our customers experienced the fewest outages in company history. We also opened our first of 3 state-of-the-art electric distribution control centers last year, integrating leading technology to further improve operations.
In terms of electric supply, we continue to make good progress on our goal of 33% qualified renewables by 2020. And last year, our electric supply portfolio was more than 50% greenhouse-gas-free, making us one of the cleanest utilities in the country.
On the gas side, we're especially proud of the international certifications we've received for our asset management practices. Not only did we receive the initial certifications from Lloyd's Registered in May, but in November, we were recertified after an extensive follow-up audit, which validated the sustainability of our program. We're one of only a few utilities in the world to achieve these certifications.
Also in gas last month, we announced that we've now completed our system-wide cast iron pipe replacement program, making our gas system even safer. And you can see on the slide, the extensive work we completed on strength testing, valve automation and pipe replacement.
Now all of this work is being acknowledged by our customers. Our customer satisfaction results in 2014 were the highest we've seen since 2009, which is before the San Bruno accident. While we're proud of all these achievements, we know we have more work to do. And we'll continue to look for, find and fix areas that need improvement.
Moving onto our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or our PSEP, we've completed the majority of the planned expense work in PSEP, although a small amount of work will continue into this year. And Kent will cover how this fits into our 2015 plans.
On the capital side of the program, the last part of the PSEP has proven to be very challenging. Late last year, we determined that the permitting and routing for a number of the remaining pipeline replacement projects, including some in environmentally sensitive areas, will be more difficult than we previously expected. So we now expect the work to be more costly and will be completed over the next few years, which is longer than we had originally anticipated. Since the PSEP program has a cap on the recovery of capital, we took a charge of $116 million in the fourth quarter for these higher expected costs.
Shifting to regulatory matters. The hearings in the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case started last week and are expected to conclude this month. The current schedule calls for a final decision in August with revenues retroactive to January 1 of this year. As a reminder, the final decision on the order to show cause related to ex parte communication to the gas transmission rate case called for a disallowance of up to 5 months of the increase in the authorized revenue. As you know, we've appealed that portion of the decision.
In other regulatory matters, in December, the commission approved an incentive award for our energy efficiency programs and our cost of capital mechanism was extended for another year. It will now be in place through the end of 2016.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

As usual, I plan to go through our Q4 results. And now I'll provide some insights about our 2015 outlook.
Slide 5 shows our results for Q4 and full year 2014.  Earnings from operations came in at $0.53 for the quarter and $3.50 for the year. GAAP earnings including our items impacting comparability are shown here as well. We've got the details regarding the natural gas item in the table at the bottom in pretax dollars. Our pipeline related expenses came in at $102 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year, which was just below our guidance range. As Chris mentioned, a modest amount of PSEP-related expense work will spill over into 2015.
Next is the disallowed capital write-off for PSEP of $116 million related to the higher cost to complete the remaining PSEP capital work. Because there's a cost cap in place, we wrote off those costs that we anticipate will come in above the cap.
On the next line, you see that were recorded $12 million of fines, mainly for the gas distribution accident in Carmel last March. We believe that fine is excessive and we've requested a rehearing.
We adjusted our third-party liability claims related to San Bruno down by $7 million as a result of settling the last few claims in Q4. That leaves our total loss at $558 million versus our previous estimate of $565 million.
Finally, we booked $26 million in insurance recoveries in the quarter for a total of $112 million for the year.
Slide 6 is the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, and you've seen many of these same drivers in previous quarters. The first 3 items relate primarily to 2014 -- to the 2014 General Rate Case and they total $0.19.
I'm just going to go through each of them briefly. First, as a result of the GRC decision, our expense recovery increased $0.08 quarter-over-quarter. This represents the impact of recovering higher levels of spend that were not being recovered in 2013.
Second, we had a positive $0.06 resulting from tax benefits related to our federal tax deduction for repairs costs.
Third, we've recorded earnings on a higher authorized rate base, this totaled $0.05. As you see, we also had some smaller positive items in the quarter, a pick up on some regulatory matters, the absence of some project and lease charges experienced in the prior year and various other items included in miscellaneous.
These positives were partially offset by a $0.14 timing item related to taxes and operating expenses that was driven mainly by the delay in our General Rate Case. You may remember this from last quarter's call. In Q4, this item turned around as expected, reversing out the impact experienced earlier in the year.
Finally, our share dilution came in at $0.02 negative quarter-over-quarter.
Now I'd like to provide a few thoughts about our future performance. Since we're still awaiting resolution to the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC, we're not providing guidance today for 2015 earnings. However, we are providing key assumptions for earnings from operations and items impacting comparability to help you understand our profile.
If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see some key assumptions for 2015 earnings from operations. First in the upper left, you see were assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year. The breakdown by line of business is included here as well. In the upper right, you'll see that our estimated -- our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $31 billion. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges we've previously provided, so no real change there.
In the lower left, you'll see that there also are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective for EFO is to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
Many of these should look familiar from last year, and I'll briefly touch on them and reiterate what we've previously told you about them. In terms of the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case, the first bullet is just a reminder that the outcome of the case is not known at this stage, so we have some uncertainty regarding the impact on 2015 results.
The second bullet under the gas transmission case is also a reminder that we've not sought recovery of some operating expenses in 2015 and beyond. These are for certain corrosion and strength testing work. We've previously indicated that these expenses taken together should average roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year period, although the amount may vary year-to-year.
Next is the tax benefits associated with the repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was almost a quarter and we've indicated that we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude in 2015.
The next 2 factors, incentive revenues and monetizing SolarCity shares, you saw last year as well. In terms of SolarCity, we said that about 2/3 of the shares were monetized in 2014. As a result, you should expect a smaller impact this year than last.
Finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by the below-the-line cost. So these include advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs and so forth.
Before I move on to the next slide, I want to make one more point. We won't receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case until at least the third quarter based on the current schedule. Because the decision will be retroactive to January 1, the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations, but it will have an impact on our quarterly results just as you saw with our General Rate Case last year.
Okay, turning to Slide 8. You'll see our assumptions for items impacting comparability in 2015. Our framework for 2015 will have 3 components: pipeline related expenses; legal and regulatory related expenses; and fines and penalties. I'll walk you through each of these.
First, we're providing an estimated range for pipeline related expenses of $100 million to $150 million, which represents a significant reduction from prior years.
The majority of the dollars here are for clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We're now beginning the third year of that program, which we have estimated to cost up to $500 million from its inception in 2013 through its plan completion in 2017.
The range for pipeline related expense also includes a smaller amount, roughly $25 million to the PSEP expense work that was carried over from last year.
Second is legal and regulatory related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million for the year. Here, we've consolidated all legal and other costs expected to be incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications.
Third, our potential fines and penalties, again, related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications. For example, this would include resolution of the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC. It would also include gas transmission rate case revenues disallowed by the CPUC as a penalty for ex parte communication. As has been our practice in the past, we're not providing guidance for fines and penalties in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 9. We assume equity issuance of $400 million to $600 million in 2015, that compares to equity issuance last year of $827 million. This range is consistent with the other assumptions I've provided this morning, including our CapEx profile and our items impacting comparability, and assumes we receive a reasonable outcome in our gas transmission rate case. Importantly, the range does that reflect additional fines or penalties in connection with natural gas matters or regulatory communications. Those would be incremental to this range.
Finally, Slides 10 and 11 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016 and these are consistent with what we've shown you previously. Our total CapEx is expected to remain well above $5 billion annually during this period. Our average rate base is expected to grow to more than $33 billion in 2016, representing about a 9% CAGR over 2014.
We anticipate providing you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.
I'll end with that, and we'll open up the lines for your questions."

The governor of course in his State of the State speech outlined some long-term objectives. The utilities here in California are all working together and want to work with the state to develop what those policies are. Clearly we'll be going above 33%. We think that a clean energy standard that gives us some flexibility going forward makes sense. But in any event, even assuming we're going to be continuing to develop our renewable portfolio, most of the renewables now are part of our purchase power portfolio. We did do some utility on Solar early on, decided that wasn't a strength for us. So I would anticipate that in the future, as our renewables go up, it just will flow through our purchase power accounts rather than being an investment in capital. Although we continue to look at new technologies, what it will do is as renewables go up, the grid becomes more complex to manage. And as Chris has said in a number of speeches, that's our investment opportunity: to invest in going from the traditional one-way flow of power on the grid to multi-flow power that is not as predictable and that's going to be where we think there are growth opportunities."

We don't have projections out there as to what the dollars look like, but those are dollars that we've already started to put in place in some of our projections that you already see here around '15 and '16, includes some dollars for continuing to modernize.

And that has paved tremendous benefits, the NAPA earthquake and the storms that we had at the end of 2014. In fact, just last week, we had some major storms here in California and had really superb results because we're able to immediately detect where the outages are and then automatically reconfigure the system.

What you've really asked about is, is there a similar phenomenon in 2015 for the gas transmission case? And there is, that's absolutely true. It's probably not the same magnitude, but there is a similar phenomenon, which otherwise will cause us to have a little more equity this year as compared to the subsequent year when you have the revenues throughout the year. The other drivers up here, just to quickly go over them. We do have because of rate base growth, we do have higher earnings in 2015. So that slightly reduces the equity need this year. We also have lower uncovered cost. We've talk about that on the calls, similarly reduces the equity need.

2014 was a strong year for us. And I feel really good about the significant accomplishments that we've had in our operations. There's no question that our system is safer and our customers are experiencing greater reliability now than they ever had in the past. And proof of this is in our customer satisfaction scores.
I've always believed that strong operations are the foundation for longer term financial success, and we're working hard to deliver on both fronts. Chris will tell you more about our operational results in a moment, and then Kent will go through the financials.
In addition to the great progress we've made operationally, I want to acknowledge the setbacks we had last year related to communications between the company and our regulators. As you know, we took quick and decisive action, making it clear to our employees and the public that noncompliance has no place in our organization. And with the help of outside experts, we're establishing a best-in-class compliance program. 
I also want to acknowledge that we still don't have a final resolution in the gas transmission OII investigations. With the proposed decision issued last September, we believe the commission has all the information it needs, and we hope to see a final decision soon.
Now as we look ahead, with the resolution of the General Rate Case last year, we are positioned to continue investing in our gas and electric systems. We plan to build on our progress of the past few years by continuing to upgrade our gas and electric infrastructure and leverage technology to enhance performance and modernize the grid.
Over the next few years, we expect our capital spending to be more than $5 billion a year, and we're optimistic about PG&E's growth opportunities. We plan to continue to take advantage of our location near Silicon Valley to help design and build the grid of the future, or as we've been calling it, the Grid of Things, where distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy storage and other technologies are integrated into a two-way power grid.
Governor Brown recently set out some ambitious goals for California to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030. We believe these policies are in line with our own strategies on clean energy, vehicle electrification and energy efficiency, and look forward to working with policymakers to develop and implement these new standards.
In fact, yesterday, we filed an application at the CPUC to invest $500 million over 5 years in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which we believe is critical for EV adoption and greenhouse gas reduction. We're glad the CPUC has recognized that the utilities are important players in the electrification of the transportation sector, and we're eager to get our program approved and underway.
So with that, now, let me turn it over to Chris."

As you can see on Slide 4, I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments from the quarter and the year.
As Tony mentioned, we had a really strong operational results in 2014. Starting with safety, we're extremely proud of our performance on key public safety metrics, such as gas odor response time, 911 response and third-party dig-ins. For example, last year, PG&E employees responded to gas emergency calls in an average of less than 20 minutes, which represents one of the fastest response times in the industry.
In terms of electric reliability, 2014 was our sixth straight year of record performance for outage duration, and our customers experienced the fewest outages in company history. We also opened our first of 3 state-of-the-art electric distribution control centers last year, integrating leading technology to further improve operations.
In terms of electric supply, we continue to make good progress on our goal of 33% qualified renewables by 2020. And last year, our electric supply portfolio was more than 50% greenhouse-gas-free, making us one of the cleanest utilities in the country.
On the gas side, we're especially proud of the international certifications we received for our asset management practices. Not only did we receive the initial certifications from Lloyd's Register in May, but in November, we were recertified after an extensive follow-up audit, which validated the sustainability of our program. We're one of only a few utilities in the world to have achieved these certifications.
Also in gas last month, we announced that we've now completed our system-wide cast iron pipe replacement program, making our gas system even safer. And you can see on the slide, the extensive work we completed on strength testing, valve automation and pipe replacement.
Now all of this work is being acknowledged by our customers. Our customer satisfaction results in 2014 were the highest we've seen since 2009, which is before the San Bruno accident. While we're proud of all of these achievements, we know we have more work to do. And we'll continue to look for, find and fix areas that need improvement.
Moving onto our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or our PSEP, we've completed the majority of the planned expense work in PSEP, although a small amount of work will continue into this year. And Kent will cover how this fits into our 2015 plans.
On the capital side of the program, the last part of the PSEP has proven to be very challenging. Late last year, we determined that the permitting and routing for a number of the remaining pipeline replacement projects, including some in environmentally sensitive areas, will be more difficult than we previously expected. So we now expect the work to be more costly and will be completed over the next few years, which is longer than we had originally anticipated. Since the PSEP program has a cap on the recovery of capital, we took a charge of $116 million in the fourth quarter for these higher expected costs.
Shifting to regulatory matters. The hearings in the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case started last week and are expected to conclude this month. The current schedule calls for a final decision in August with revenues retroactive to January 1 of this year. As a reminder, the final decision on the order to show cause related to ex parte communication to the gas transmission rate case, called for a disallowance of up to 5 months of the increase in the authorized revenue. As you know, we've appealed that portion of the decision.
In other regulatory matters, in December, the commission approved an incentive award for our energy efficiency programs and our cost of capital mechanism was extended for another year. It will now be in place through the end of 2016.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

As usual, I plan to go through our Q4 results. And then I'll provide some insights about our 2015 outlook.
Slide 5 shows our results for Q4 and full year 2014.  Earnings from operations came in at $0.53 for the quarter and $3.50 for the year. GAAP earnings including our items impacting comparability are shown here as well. We've got the details regarding the natural gas item in the table at the bottom in pretax dollars. Our pipeline related expenses came in at $102 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year, which was just below our guidance range. As Chris mentioned, a modest amount of PSEP-related expense work will spill over into 2015.
Next is the disallowed capital write-off for PSEP of $116 million, related to the higher cost to complete the remaining PSEP capital work. Because there's a cost cap in place, we wrote off those costs that we anticipate will come in above the cap.
On the next line, you see that we recorded $12 million of fines, mainly for the gas distribution accident in Carmel last March. We believe that fine is excessive, and we've requested a rehearing.
We adjusted our third-party liability claims related to San Bruno down by $7 million as a result of settling the last few claims in Q4. That leaves our total loss at $558 million, versus our previous estimate of $565 million.
Finally, we booked $26 million in insurance recoveries in the quarter for a total of $112 million for the year.
Slide 6 is the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, and you've seen many of these same drivers in previous quarters. 
The first 3 items relate primarily to 2014 -- to the 2014 General Rate Case and they total $0.19. I'm just going to go through each of them briefly. 
First, as a result of the GRC decision, our expense recovery increased $0.08 quarter-over-quarter. This represents the impact of recovering higher levels of spend that were not being recovered in 2013. Second, we had a positive $0.06 resulting from tax benefits related to our federal tax deduction for repairs costs. Third, we recorded earnings on a higher authorized rate base, this totaled $0.05. 
As you see, we also had some smaller positive items in the quarter, a pick up on some regulatory matters, the absence of some project and lease charges experienced in the prior year, and various other items included in miscellaneous.
These positives were partially offset by a $0.14 timing item related to taxes and operating expenses that was driven mainly by the delay in our General Rate Case. You may remember this from last quarter's call. In Q4, this item turned around as expected, reversing out the impact experienced earlier in the year. Finally, our share dilution came in at $0.02 negative quarter-over-quarter.
Now I'd like to provide a few thoughts about our future performance. Since we're still awaiting resolution to the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC, we're not providing guidance today for 2015 earnings. However, we are providing key assumptions for earnings from operations and items impacting comparability to help you understand our profile.
If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see some key assumptions for 2015 earnings from operations. First in the upper left, you see were assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year. The breakdown by line of business is included here as well. In the upper right, you see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $31 billion. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges we've previously provided, so no real change there.
In the lower left, you'll see that there also are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective for EFO is to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
Many of these should look familiar from last year, and I'll briefly touch on them and reiterate what we've previously told you about them. 
In terms of the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case, the first bullet is just a reminder that the outcome of the case is not known at this stage, so we have some uncertainty regarding the impact on 2015 results.
The second bullet under the gas transmission case is also a reminder that we've not sought recovery of some operating expenses in 2015 and beyond. These are for certain corrosion and strength testing work. We previously indicated that these expenses taken together should average roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year period, although the amount may vary year-to-year.
Next is the tax benefits associated with the repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was almost a quarter, and we've indicated that we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude in 2015.
The next 2 factors, incentive revenues and monetizing SolarCity shares, you saw last year as well. In terms of SolarCity, we've said that about 2/3 of the shares were monetized in 2014. As a result, you should expect a smaller impact this year than last.
Finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by the below-the-line costs. So these include advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs and so forth.
Before I move on to the next slide, I want to make one more point. We won't receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case until at least the third quarter based on the current schedule. Because the decision will be retroactive to January 1, the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations, but it will have an impact on our quarterly results, just as you saw with our General Rate Case last year.
Okay, turning to Slide 8. You'll see our assumptions for items impacting comparability in 2015. Our framework for 2015 will have 3 components: pipeline related expenses, legal and regulatory related expenses, and fines and penalties. I'll walk you through each of these.
First, we're providing an estimated range for pipeline related expenses of $100 million to $150 million, which represents a significant reduction from prior years.
The majority of the dollars here are for clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We're now beginning the third year of that program, which we have estimated to cost up to $500 million from its inception in 2013 through its plan completion in 2017. The range for pipeline related expenses also includes a smaller amount, roughly $25 million, for the PSEP expense work that was carried over from last year.
Second is legal and regulatory related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million for the year. Here, we've consolidated all legal and other costs expected to be incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications.
Third, our potential fines and penalties, again, related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications. For example, this would include resolution of the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC. It would also include gas transmission rate case revenues disallowed by the CPUC as a penalty for ex parte communication. As has been our practice in the past, we're not providing guidance for fines and penalties in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 9. We assume equity issuance of $400 million to $600 million in 2015. That compares to equity issuance last year of $827 million. This range is consistent with the other assumptions I've provided this morning, including our CapEx profile and our items impacting comparability, and assumes we receive a reasonable outcome in our gas transmission rate case. Importantly, the range does not reflect additional fines or penalties in connection with natural gas matters or regulatory communications. Those would be incremental to this range.
Finally, Slides 10 and 11 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016, and these are consistent with what we've shown you previously. Our total CapEx is expected to remain well above $5 billion annually during this period. Our average rate base is expected to grow to more than $33 billion in 2016, representing about a 9% CAGR over 2014.
We anticipate providing you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.
I'll end with that, and we'll open up the lines for your questions."

The governor of course in his State of the State speech outlined some long-term objectives. The utilities here in California are all working together and want to work with the state to develop what those policies are. Clearly we'll be going above 33%. We think a clean energy standard that gives us some flexibility going forward makes sense. But in any event, even assuming we're going to be continuing to develop our renewable portfolio, most of the renewables now are part of our purchased power portfolio. We did do some utility owned solar early on. Decided that wasn't a strength for us. So I would anticipate that in the future, as our renewables go up, it just will flow through our purchased power accounts, rather than being an investment in capital. Although we continue to look at new technologies, what it will do is as renewables go up, the grid becomes more complex to manage. And as Chris has said in a number of speeches, that's our investment opportunity, to invest in going from the traditional one-way flow of power on the grid to multi-flow power that is not as predictable. And that's going to be where we think there are growth opportunities."

We don't have projections out there as to what the dollars look like, but those are dollars that we've already started to put in place in some of our projections that you already see here around '15 and '16, includes some dollars for continuing to modernize. So as we've continued to move forward with making sure that we're in a position to be able to hook up the solar panels and the batteries and the plug-in vehicles into our system, we've continued to evaluate not just replacing old wire, but modernizing the entirety of the system and putting more technology into it.

And that has paid tremendous benefits, the Napa earthquake and the storms that we had at the end of 2014.

What you've really asked about is, is there a similar phenomenon in 2015 for the gas transmission case? And there is, that's absolutely true. It's probably not the same magnitude, but there is a similar phenomenon, which otherwise will cause us to have a little more equity this year as compared to the subsequent year when you have the revenues throughout the year. The other drivers up here, just to quickly go over them. We do have because of rate base growth, we do have higher earnings in 2015. So that slightly reduces the equity need this year. We also have lower unrecovered costs. We've talked about that on the call, similarly reduces the equity need.

2014 was a strong year for us. And I feel really good about the significant accomplishments that we've had in our operations. There's no question that our system is safer and our customers are experiencing greater reliability now than they ever had in the past. And proof of this is in our customer satisfaction scores.
I've always believed that strong operations are the foundation for longer term financial success, and we're working hard to deliver on both fronts. Chris will tell you more about our operational results in a moment, and then Kent will go through the financials.
In addition to the great progress we've made operationally, I want to acknowledge the setbacks we had last year related to communications between the company and our regulators. As you know, we took quick and decisive action, making it clear to our employees and the public that noncompliance has no place in our organization. And with the help of outside experts, we're establishing a best-in-class compliance program. 
I also want to acknowledge that we still don't have a final resolution in the gas transmission OII investigations. With the proposed decision issued last September, we believe the commission has all the information it needs, and we hope to see a final decision soon.
Now as we look ahead, with the resolution of the General Rate Case last year, we are positioned to continue investing in our gas and electric systems. We plan to build on our progress of the past few years by continuing to upgrade our gas and electric infrastructure and leverage technology to enhance performance and modernize the grid.
Over the next few years, we expect our capital spending to be more than $5 billion a year, and we're optimistic about PG&E's growth opportunities. We plan to continue to take advantage of our location near Silicon Valley to help design and build the grid of the future, or as we've been calling it, the Grid of Things, where distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy storage and other technologies are integrated into a two-way power grid.
Governor Brown recently set out some ambitious goals for California to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030. We believe these policies are in line with our own strategies on clean energy, vehicle electrification and energy efficiency, and look forward to working with policymakers to develop and implement these new standards.
In fact, yesterday, we filed an application at the CPUC to invest $500 million over 5 years in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which we believe is critical for EV adoption and greenhouse gas reduction. We're glad the CPUC has recognized that the utilities are important players in the electrification of the transportation sector, and we're eager to get our program approved and underway.
So with that, now, let me turn it over to Chris."

As you can see on Slide 4, I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments from the quarter and the year.
As Tony mentioned, we had a really strong operational results in 2014. Starting with safety, we're extremely proud of our performance on key public safety metrics, such as gas odor response time, 911 response and third-party dig-ins. For example, last year, PG&E employees responded to gas emergency calls in an average of less than 20 minutes, which represents one of the fastest response times in the industry.
In terms of electric reliability, 2014 was our sixth straight year of record performance for outage duration, and our customers experienced the fewest outages in company history. We also opened our first of 3 state-of-the-art electric distribution control centers last year, integrating leading technology to further improve operations.
In terms of electric supply, we continue to make good progress on our goal of 33% qualified renewables by 2020. And last year, our electric supply portfolio was more than 50% greenhouse-gas-free, making us one of the cleanest utilities in the country.
On the gas side, we're especially proud of the international certifications we received for our asset management practices. Not only did we receive the initial certifications from Lloyd's Register in May, but in November, we were recertified after an extensive follow-up audit, which validated the sustainability of our program. We're one of only a few utilities in the world to have achieved these certifications.
Also in gas last month, we announced that we've now completed our system-wide cast iron pipe replacement program, making our gas system even safer. And you can see on the slide, the extensive work we completed on strength testing, valve automation and pipe replacement.
Now all of this work is being acknowledged by our customers. Our customer satisfaction results in 2014 were the highest we've seen since 2009, which is before the San Bruno accident. While we're proud of all of these achievements, we know we have more work to do. And we'll continue to look for, find and fix areas that need improvement.
Moving onto our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or our PSEP, we've completed the majority of the planned expense work in PSEP, although a small amount of work will continue into this year. And Kent will cover how this fits into our 2015 plans.
On the capital side of the program, the last part of the PSEP has proven to be very challenging. Late last year, we determined that the permitting and routing for a number of the remaining pipeline replacement projects, including some in environmentally sensitive areas, will be more difficult than we previously expected. So we now expect the work to be more costly and will be completed over the next few years, which is longer than we had originally anticipated. Since the PSEP program has a cap on the recovery of capital, we took a charge of $116 million in the fourth quarter for these higher expected costs.
Shifting to regulatory matters. The hearings in the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case started last week and are expected to conclude this month. The current schedule calls for a final decision in August with revenues retroactive to January 1 of this year. As a reminder, the final decision on the order to show cause related to ex parte communication to the gas transmission rate case, called for a disallowance of up to 5 months of the increase in the authorized revenue. As you know, we've appealed that portion of the decision.
In other regulatory matters, in December, the commission approved an incentive award for our energy efficiency programs and our cost of capital mechanism was extended for another year. It will now be in place through the end of 2016.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

As usual, I plan to go through our Q4 results. And then I'll provide some insights about our 2015 outlook.
Slide 5 shows our results for Q4 and full year 2014.  Earnings from operations came in at $0.53 for the quarter and $3.50 for the year. GAAP earnings including our items impacting comparability are shown here as well. We've got the details regarding the natural gas item in the table at the bottom in pretax dollars. Our pipeline related expenses came in at $102 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year, which was just below our guidance range. As Chris mentioned, a modest amount of PSEP-related expense work will spill over into 2015.
Next is the disallowed capital write-off for PSEP of $116 million, related to the higher cost to complete the remaining PSEP capital work. Because there's a cost cap in place, we wrote off those costs that we anticipate will come in above the cap.
On the next line, you see that we recorded $12 million of fines, mainly for the gas distribution accident in Carmel last March. We believe that fine is excessive, and we've requested a rehearing.
We adjusted our third-party liability claims related to San Bruno down by $7 million as a result of settling the last few claims in Q4. That leaves our total loss at $558 million, versus our previous estimate of $565 million.
Finally, we booked $26 million in insurance recoveries in the quarter for a total of $112 million for the year.
Slide 6 is the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, and you've seen many of these same drivers in previous quarters. 
The first 3 items relate primarily to 2014 -- to the 2014 General Rate Case and they total $0.19. I'm just going to go through each of them briefly. 
First, as a result of the GRC decision, our expense recovery increased $0.08 quarter-over-quarter. This represents the impact of recovering higher levels of spend that were not being recovered in 2013. Second, we had a positive $0.06 resulting from tax benefits related to our federal tax deduction for repairs costs. Third, we recorded earnings on a higher authorized rate base, this totaled $0.05. 
As you see, we also had some smaller positive items in the quarter, a pick up on some regulatory matters, the absence of some project and lease charges experienced in the prior year, and various other items included in miscellaneous.
These positives were partially offset by a $0.14 timing item related to taxes and operating expenses that was driven mainly by the delay in our General Rate Case. You may remember this from last quarter's call. In Q4, this item turned around as expected, reversing out the impact experienced earlier in the year. Finally, our share dilution came in at $0.02 negative quarter-over-quarter.
Now I'd like to provide a few thoughts about our future performance. Since we're still awaiting resolution to the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC, we're not providing guidance today for 2015 earnings. However, we are providing key assumptions for earnings from operations and items impacting comparability to help you understand our profile.
If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see some key assumptions for 2015 earnings from operations. First in the upper left, you see were assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year. The breakdown by line of business is included here as well. In the upper right, you see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $31 billion. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges we've previously provided, so no real change there.
In the lower left, you'll see that there also are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective for EFO is to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
Many of these should look familiar from last year, and I'll briefly touch on them and reiterate what we've previously told you about them. 
In terms of the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case, the first bullet is just a reminder that the outcome of the case is not known at this stage, so we have some uncertainty regarding the impact on 2015 results.
The second bullet under the gas transmission case is also a reminder that we've not sought recovery of some operating expenses in 2015 and beyond. These are for certain corrosion and strength testing work. We previously indicated that these expenses taken together should average roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year period, although the amount may vary year-to-year.
Next is the tax benefits associated with the repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was almost a quarter, and we've indicated that we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude in 2015.
The next 2 factors, incentive revenues and monetizing SolarCity shares, you saw last year as well. In terms of SolarCity, we've said that about 2/3 of the shares were monetized in 2014. As a result, you should expect a smaller impact this year than last.
Finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by the below-the-line costs. So these include advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs and so forth.
Before I move on to the next slide, I want to make one more point. We won't receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case until at least the third quarter based on the current schedule. Because the decision will be retroactive to January 1, the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations, but it will have an impact on our quarterly results, just as you saw with our General Rate Case last year.
Okay, turning to Slide 8. You'll see our assumptions for items impacting comparability in 2015. Our framework for 2015 will have 3 components: pipeline related expenses, legal and regulatory related expenses, and fines and penalties. I'll walk you through each of these.
First, we're providing an estimated range for pipeline related expenses of $100 million to $150 million, which represents a significant reduction from prior years.
The majority of the dollars here are for clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We're now beginning the third year of that program, which we have estimated to cost up to $500 million from its inception in 2013 through its plan completion in 2017. The range for pipeline related expenses also includes a smaller amount, roughly $25 million, for the PSEP expense work that was carried over from last year.
Second is legal and regulatory related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million for the year. Here, we've consolidated all legal and other costs expected to be incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications.
Third, our potential fines and penalties, again, related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications. For example, this would include resolution of the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC. It would also include gas transmission rate case revenues disallowed by the CPUC as a penalty for ex parte communication. As has been our practice in the past, we're not providing guidance for fines and penalties in 2015.
Moving on to Slide 9. We assume equity issuance of $400 million to $600 million in 2015. That compares to equity issuance last year of $827 million. This range is consistent with the other assumptions I've provided this morning, including our CapEx profile and our items impacting comparability, and assumes we receive a reasonable outcome in our gas transmission rate case. Importantly, the range does not reflect additional fines or penalties in connection with natural gas matters or regulatory communications. Those would be incremental to this range.
Finally, Slides 10 and 11 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016, and these are consistent with what we've shown you previously. Our total CapEx is expected to remain well above $5 billion annually during this period. Our average rate base is expected to grow to more than $33 billion in 2016, representing about a 9% CAGR over 2014.
We anticipate providing you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.
I'll end with that, and we'll open up the lines for your questions."

The governor of course in his State of the State speech outlined some long-term objectives. The utilities here in California are all working together and want to work with the state to develop what those policies are. Clearly we'll be going above 33%. We think a clean energy standard that gives us some flexibility going forward makes sense. But in any event, even assuming we're going to be continuing to develop our renewable portfolio, most of the renewables now are part of our purchased power portfolio. We did do some utility owned solar early on. Decided that wasn't a strength for us. So I would anticipate that in the future, as our renewables go up, it just will flow through our purchased power accounts, rather than being an investment in capital. Although we continue to look at new technologies, what it will do is as renewables go up, the grid becomes more complex to manage. And as Chris has said in a number of speeches, that's our investment opportunity, to invest in going from the traditional one-way flow of power on the grid to multi-flow power that is not as predictable. And that's going to be where we think there are growth opportunities."

We don't have projections out there as to what the dollars look like, but those are dollars that we've already started to put in place in some of our projections that you already see here around '15 and '16, includes some dollars for continuing to modernize. So as we've continued to move forward with making sure that we're in a position to be able to hook up the solar panels and the batteries and the plug-in vehicles into our system, we've continued to evaluate not just replacing old wire, but modernizing the entirety of the system and putting more technology into it.

And that has paid tremendous benefits, the Napa earthquake and the storms that we had at the end of 2014.

So we're doing that.

So to be able to detect and then to be able to control voltages on those systems, and that's an ongoing program.

What you've really asked about is, is there a similar phenomenon in 2015 for the gas transmission case? And there is, that's absolutely true. It's probably not the same magnitude, but there is a similar phenomenon, which otherwise will cause us to have a little more equity this year as compared to the subsequent year when you have the revenues throughout the year. The other drivers up here, just to quickly go over them. We do have because of rate base growth, we do have higher earnings in 2015. So that slightly reduces the equity need this year. We also have lower unrecovered costs. We've talked about that on the call, similarly reduces the equity need.

I'm going to start with some opening remarks. And then turn it over to Chris and Kent to provide more detail on both operational and financial issues.
As you know, we received the final penalty decision on the gas transmission pipeline investigations earlier this month which is a significant milestone. Following the San Bruno accident, we worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno. We've dedicated ourselves to becoming the safest and most reliable utility in the country.
We've been working to build a culture across the company that supports this mission. And we've completed an unprecedented level of work to improve the safety of our system, much of it funded by our shareholders.
So although the final penalty assessed by the commission is the largest in state history and certainly one of the largest in the country, we've decided not to appeal. We just don't feel that prolonging the proceeding is in anyone's interest.
As we move forward, I can assure you that the lessons from San Bruno will continue to guide us. That San Bruno accident has changed the way we look at everything from the way we plan to what work we do to the way we execute and document work in the field.
Safety starts at the top. It also requires the unequivocal commitment of every employee. My management team, our employees and the unions who represent them have all made that commitment and safety has been at the heart of our decision and actions over the last several years.
I want to acknowledged that we still have a number of proceedings outstanding. On the legal front, a trial date in the federal criminal case has been set for March 8, 2016. As you know, state federal prosecutors have been investigating potential ex parte communications with the CPUC as well.
There are also still several investigations at the commission, including a new investigation of our safety culture that President Picker announced at the last commission meeting. And in fact, we welcome a conversation about safety at PG&E. We're proud of the work we've done to date. And we know we still have a lot of work to do to reearn the trust of our customers and the commission.
Over the past several years, we've hired some of the best experts in the country to help guide our efforts. Adding to that list, this spring, we announced that we've hired Julie Kane as our new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reporting directly to me.
Julie has deep compliance experience, largely in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry. And her mandate is to work with our Board of Directors and our leadership team to build a best-in-class compliance program.
As Chris will discuss, we had another solid quarter in our operations. We're in the third year of a rigorous risk assessment program that we used to develop our 5-year operational plan. And I've been really pleased to see that these plans become more robust every year.
And we continue to see strong opportunities for growth as we work to build a better California. In both gas and electric operations, we'll continue to upgrade the system with a focus on reducing risk and enhancing safety and reliability through physical improvement like replacing pipes and wires and using technology to respond to our customers changing needs.
We're also working on integrating clean energy plan which we believe will offer strong support for Governor Brown's vision of reducing carbon emission.
In the coming years, we expect to see continued investment opportunities to support the interactive Grid of Things. This will facilitate the state's increasing reliance on intermittent renewables, electric vehicles, demand-side management tools and energy storage. We have a number of proceedings pending at the commission to address these changes to the electric grid and you can expect to see more about this in the future.
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris."

I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations. And then touch on some additional regulatory developments. I'm going to start with safety, which is fundamental to the work that our crews do everyday.
Over the past few years, we work to create an environment where all employees feel comfortable speaking up when something doesn't look right or they identify a potential safety risk.
We were gratified to see that this was one of the areas where we received the most positive feedback in our employee survey last year. By encouraging this find it and fix it mindset, and recognizing employees who do speak up, or stop jobs when safety is a concern, we're identifying and addressing issues early. We measure ourselves on a set of safety metrics associated with both public and employee safety and you can see several others in our appendix in the slide deck.
For example, we target responding to emergency gas calls within 21 minutes. During the first quarter, we had responders on-site with an average of less than 20 minutes. That's a level of performance towards the very top of the industry.
On the electric side, we chatted improvement every year on a number of sustained outages costs by downed wires. In the first quarter of this year, our results showed a nearly 25% improvement.
Over the past 5 years, safety metrics have been an increasing component of our variable compensation plan. In gas operations, we continue to do significant work on our pipeline system, testing, replacing and automating components. For several years, we have been diligently addressing the recommendations made by the NTSB following the San Bruno accident. The NTSB disclosed 9 of the 12 recommendations. The remaining 3 recommendations which involves strength testing, valve installation and control room procedures are longer term multi-year efforts and they continue to be on track.
In electric operations, we continue to see strong reliability performance with our customers experiencing fewer and shorter outages.
In the California ISO awarded us 2 of the 3 competitive transmission projects we submitted bids last year, both of which are in our service territory.
As California enters its fourth year of drought, we're working hard to stop the state meet this challenge by reducing water usage at our own facility, encouraging customers to conserve by offering rebates for more efficient washers and agricultural pumps. We're stepping up our vegetation management activities to mitigate wildfire risk and improve access for firefighters. And we're managing water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer.
Shifting to regulatory matters. As Tony mentioned, the commission issued a $1.6 billion final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. And Kent will take you through the specific components of that in a minute.
The commission also announced 2 new investigations, One on regulatory communications and one on our safety culture. The work we've undertaken to improve our safety culture over the past 4.5 years has been informed by significant benchmarking and input from experts from the outside. And we look forward to the opportunities to share our progress with the commission.
Moving to the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case, we completed hearings in March. PG&E presented a strong case informed by a detailed risk assessment of the assets across our system.
The next steps are opening briefs, which will be filed today, and then reply brief on May 20.
The current schedule calls for a final decision in the rate case in August of 2015, with revenues retroactive to January 1. It's unclear at this point how the final penalty decision will impact the schedule. Last week, we received a proposed decision in the residential rate reform proceeding at the commission. The proposed decision acknowledges the need for fundamental rate reform and recommends reducing residential tiers from 4 to 2 over the next few years.
However, we were disappointed that it failed in the near term to adapt monthly charges to recover fixed costs. Fixed charges are a common element of many utilities rates and we continue to believe that can be implemented with minimal impact to customers, and that the time is right to adapt them in California.
We'll be filing comments on the proposed decisions in May. And finally, as we look forward in September of this year, we'll be filing our next General Rate Case, which will set forth our plans for gas and electric distribution and generation from 2017 to 2019.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

Today, I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for",1999,"Thanks, and good morning. Today, I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for 2015.
First, our quarterly results, which were summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.87 for the quarter. GAAP earnings, including our items in impacting comparability came in at $0.06. Obviously, our items impacting comparability drove much of the story for the quarter, so let me go through those.
Our pipeline related expenses came in at $17 million pretax or $10 million after-tax as shown in the table. And here, we've included our cost to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way. And some remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.
Our legal and regulatory expenses were $14 million pretax or $8 million after-tax in the table. These include costs incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communication.
Fines and penalties for the quarter totaled $553 million as shown in the table below. I'll walk you through the components of that.
First, the $300 million fine payable to the state resulted in a $100 million accrual in Q1. This is because we previously took a $200 million charge in 2011. Second, the $400 million customer bill credit was fully accrued in Q1. This reflects our obligation now to provide a credit to customers in February 2016. Third, the Q1 impacted the shareholder refunded safety improvements with a $53 million charge for disallowed capital. And I'm going to take a moment to explain that figure.
As you know, the final penalty decision calls for shareholders to fund $850 million of safety improvement to be determined in our 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case. This will consist of about $160 million of expense work, and about $690 million of capital work.
We expect the CPUC to reduce the authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case with these disallowed cost.
In Q1, you see nothing here for disallowed expense work. This is because of the item impacting comparability for the expense work will occur as the revenue is disallowed, not as the expenses are incurred. When we received the final decision in the Gas Transmission Rate Case, we expect to book revenues retroactive to January 1, and the impact of the revenue disallowance will redeem effectiveness in item impacting comparability and that time.
What you do see here is a $53 million charge for disallowed capital work. The item impacting comparability for capital occurs as the capital is incurred and written off.
I know that's complicated, so I'll reiterate it. This allowed expense work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case. Disallowed capital work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the capital is spent. 
One more thing to keep mind, the CPUC has not yet determined which cost will count towards the $850 million of shareholder funded safety work, so we've estimated which capital expenditures incurred during the quarter we think will qualify.
Once eligibility is determined in the Gas Transmission Owner Rate Case, we'll chew up any differences necessary.
Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operation. As you can see, we're going from $0.54 in Q1 last year to $0.87 in Q1 this year, and there are a number of factors. The largest impact, $0.21, is due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision which we didn't receive until August last year.
The impact includes both higher cost recovery as well as the tax benefit associated with repairs. In addition, $0.05 of the Q1 increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and another $0.05 because we had a nuclear refueling outage in Q1 of last year, but not this year.
There were $0.04 associated with tax timing. We expect that to net to 0 by year end. You also see $0.03 to the disposition of the remaining SolarCity shares and miscellaneous is about $0.05.
These positive factors were partially offset by $0.08 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the Gas Transmission Rate Case.
The case covers cost for work we previously included as items impacting comparability, such as hydrostatic testing and integrity management. Until we are authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case, this work will now reduce earnings from operation.
When we receive a final decision in the case, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1. And then finally, we had $0.02 for higher shares during the quarter.
That completes my summary of the Q1 result. And I now like to move on to our outlook going forward.
The final penalty decision result a significant uncertainty for the company, particularly with respect to the fines and penalties to be borne by shareholders and our associated financing team. Therefore, today, we are providing guidance for 2015 earnings from operation of $3.50 to $3.70 per share.
I want to spend some time going through the key assumptions underlying our guidance which are shown on Slide 7. And this should look familiar to you.
Starting in the upper left, you'll see that we're still assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year, consistent with our last call. In the upper right, you'll see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is still at about $31 billion. We've actually adjusted the gas transmission range down by about $200 million to reflect the estimated 2015 impacts of that capital disallowance and the final penalty decision.
Remember, this is average rate base for the year so you only see about half of the full year impact of the disallowance. In the lower left, you see there are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operation. Our objective continues to be to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
The first bullet under the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case highlights the key assumption underlying our guidance. Namely that we receive a reasonable decision in the case and that it is issued before the end of the year.
The current schedule calls for a final decision in August, but the judge has yet to determine how to address the shareholder funded safety improvement mandated in the final penalty decision. And we don't know how that could impact the schedule.
If we do not receive a final decision in the Gas Transmission Rate Case before year-end, we would not record the incremental revenues for 2015 until next year. If that were to occur, we estimate that it would reduce this year's earnings from operation by roughly $0.60 per share.
The second bullet under the rate case is the reminder that we've not thought recovery of certain corrosion at stress testing work in 2015 and beyond, and we previously indicated that these expenses, it average roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year period although the in a may vary year-over-year.
Next is the tax benefit associated with the federal repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was $0.24, and we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude this year.
After that, our -- the expense of revenue for things like our customer energy efficiency program and the impact of monetizing the remaining SolarCity shares which occurred in Q1. 
And finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by below the line cost such as advertising, charitable contribution, environmental cost and so forth.
Slide 8 summarizes our overall guidance. At the top, you'll see our 2015 guidance for earnings from operations, that's $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Guidance for our items impacting comparability is shown below that and is broken down into the 3 category. 
We've got more detail on the lease on Slide 9, so let's go there now. And I'll start at the top. You can see that we're reaffirming the estimated range for pipeline related expenses of $100 million to $150 million. We're also reaffirming the estimated range for legal and regulatory related expenses of $25 million to $75 million.
Next, we're establishing an estimate of roughly $1 billion in 2015 for fines and penalties associated with the final decision of the gas transmission pipeline investigation. You can see the key components in the table below.
The first two, the fine payable to the state and the customer bill credit were accrued in the first quarter. We estimate that charges for disallowed capital work will come to about $350 million for the year, roughly half of the total disallowed capital. We also believe will see the full $160 million of disallowed revenues for expense work in 2015, assuming we receive a final decision in the Gas Transmission Rate Case before year end.
This estimate does not include potential fines and penalties in the future such as any revenues disallowed in the Gas Transmission Rate Case asset penalty for ex parte communication.
Slide 10 shows you how to get from this billion dollars estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigation. Going from left to right, you'll see the cost incurred prior to this year. The estimated impact for 2015. And then finally, the cost we expect to incur in future periods. The future item consist of charges for the disallowed capital next year as well as remedies specified in the final decision -- or final penalty decision. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We are now estimating our total equity needs for 2015 to be between $700 million and $800 million. This range is consistent with the guidance and assumptions I've walked you through this morning.
It compares with our prior estimate of $400 million to $600 million which, of course, did not include the impact of the fines and penalties coming out of that gas investigation. As the slide indicates, the fines and penalties clearly drive up our equity needs for the year.
Going in the other direction though, our overall cash flows are a bit stronger due to items such as balancing accounts activity and timing of expenditures during the year. This is mitigated some of our equity needs for 2015.
Keep in mind that we typically issue about $300 million annually using our internal program, our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment program. In addition, we issued $75 million in the first quarter using our continuous equity offering or dribble program.
That would leave our remaining equity needs for the year at roughly $300 million to $400 million, and we're currently evaluating options for that.
By the way, we've updated the equity factors slide in the appendix to align with the components of the final penalty decision.
Slides 12 and 13 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. The CapEx numbers are the same you've seen before, and you can see that we expect 2016 to look fairly similar to 2015, depending primarily on the outcome of the Gas Transmission Rate Case. The authorized base rate numbers have been adjusted to reflect the capital disallowance resulting from the final penalty decision. The impact on 2016 average rate base is a reduction of about $500 million. Our average rate base is expected to grow to right around $33 billion in 2016, and the adjustment for the final penalty decision result at an 8% CAGR over 2014 as compared to 9% previously.
We plan to provide you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.
With that, I'll stop here, and we'll now open the lines for your questions."

But these other factors, mainly cash flows have somewhat mitigated the overall increase. Our cash flows have improved somewhat. And those do reduce our financing requirements. And really, a key factor is within our balancing account activities. And in particular, our Energy Procurement costs which are lower, primarily due to lower gas prices. They've stayed very low this year, lower than was reflected in previous expectations. And then the other thing is really kind of timing of our CapEx and our other expenditures.

The key thing I would rely on is Slide 20 that has our equity factors.

And I'll just say, we haven't provided guidance for equity issuance beyond this year, and I don't plan to today. But I'll kind of -- I can give you some observations about it overall. I think you know our equity needs are a function of a lot of variables in any 1 period. But the key ones are our capital expenditure levels, and our unrecovered cost and penalties. And that latter one can affect our -- both our capital structure and our cash flow. And so it can trigger equity needs at different times, and that's really what this Slide 20 helps you sort through. In terms of those 2 factors, I'll just make the observation on the CapEx front. We expect 2016 to be pretty comparable to 2015, and you have those numbers. In terms of the penalty, we estimate that about 2/3 of our equity needs associated with the final penalty decision will be addressed this year as compared to next year. And you should be able to derive that using the equity factors that we've put in Slide 20. The only other thing I'll say, I'll just remind you that all of this depends on how that disallowed safety-related expense end up being treated in that gas transmission rate case, and we just won't do that for a while yet."

I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Chris and Kent to provide more detail on both operational and financial issues.
As you know, we received a final penalty decision on the gas transmission pipeline investigations earlier this month, which is a significant milestone. Following the San Bruno accident, we worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno. We've dedicated ourselves to becoming the safest and most reliable utility in the country.
We've been working to build a culture across the company that supports this mission. And we've completed an unprecedented level of work to improve the safety of our system, much of it funded by our shareholders.
So although the final penalty assessed by the commission is the largest in state history and certainly one of the largest in the country, we've decided not to appeal. We just don't feel that prolonging the proceeding is in anyone's interest.
As we move forward, I can assure you that the lessons from San Bruno will continue to guide us. The San Bruno accident has changed the way we look at everything, from the way we plan what work we do to the way we execute and document work in the field.
Safety starts at the top. It also requires the unequivocal commitment of every employee. My management team, our employees and the unions who represent them have all made that commitment and safety has been at the heart of our decisions and actions over the last several years.
I want to acknowledge that we still have a number of proceedings outstanding. On the legal front, a trial date in the federal criminal case has been set for March 8, 2016. As you know, state and federal prosecutors have been investigating potential ex parte communications with the CPUC as well.
There are also still several investigations at the commission, including a new investigation of our safety culture that President Picker announced at the last commission meeting. And in fact, we welcome a conversation about safety at PG&E. We're proud of the work we've done to date, and we know we still have a lot of work to do to reearn the trust of our customers and the commission.
Over the past several years, we've hired some of the best experts in the country to help guide our efforts. Adding to that list, this spring, we announced that we've hired Julie Kane as our new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reporting directly to me. Julie has deep compliance experience, largely in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry, and her mandate is to work with our Board of Directors and our leadership team to build a best-in-class compliance program.
As Chris will discuss, we had another solid quarter in our operations. We're in the third year of a rigorous risk assessment program that we use to develop our 5-year operational plan. And I've been really pleased to see that these plans become more robust every year.
And we continue to see strong opportunities for growth as we work to build a better California. In both gas and electric operations, we'll continue to upgrade the system with a focus on reducing risk and enhancing safety and reliability through physical improvements like replacing pipes and wires and using technology to respond to our customers' changing needs.
We're also working on an integrated clean energy plan, which we believe will offer strong support for Governor Brown's vision for reducing carbon emission.
In the coming years, we expect to see continued investment opportunities to support the interactive Grid of Things. This will facilitate the state's increasing reliance on intermittent renewables, electric vehicles, demand-side management tools and energy storage. We have a number of proceedings pending at the commission to address these changes to the electric grid and you can expect to see more about this in the future.
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris."

I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments. I'm going to start with safety, which is fundamental to the work that our crews do everyday.
Over the past few years, we've worked to create an environment where all employees feel comfortable speaking up when something doesn't look right or they identify a potential safety risk.
We were gratified to see that this was one of the areas where we received the most positive feedback in our employee survey last year. By encouraging this find it and fix it mindset and recognizing employees who do speak up or stop jobs when safety is a concern, we're identifying and addressing issues early. We measure ourselves on a set of safety metrics associated with both public and employee safety, and you can see several of those in our appendix in the slide deck.
For example, we target responding to emergency gas calls within 21 minutes. During the first quarter, we had responders on-site within an average of less than 20 minutes. That's a level of performance towards the very top of the industry.
On the electric side, we target improvement every year in a number of sustained outages caused by downed wires. In the first quarter of this year, our results showed a nearly 25% improvement.
Over the past 5 years, safety metrics have been an increasing component of our variable compensation plan. In gas operations, we continue to do significant work on our pipeline system, testing, replacing and automating components. For several years, we have been diligently addressing the recommendations made by the NTSB following the San Bruno accident. The NTSB has closed 9 of the 12 recommendations. The remaining 3 recommendations, which involves strength testing, valve installation and control room procedures, are longer-term multiyear efforts and they continue to be on track.
In electric operations, we continue to see strong reliability performance with our customers experiencing fewer and shorter outages.
In California, ISO awarded us 2 of the 3 competitive transmission projects we submitted bids for last year, both of which are in our service territory.
As California enters its fourth year of drought, we're working hard to help the state meet this challenge by reducing water usage at our own facilities, encouraging customers to conserve by offering rebates for more efficient washers and agricultural pumps. We're stepping up our vegetation management activities to mitigate wildfire risk and improve access for firefighters. And we're managing water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer.
Shifting to regulatory matters. As Tony mentioned, the commission issued a $1.6 billion final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation, and Kent will take you through the specific components of that in a minute.
The commission also announced 2 new investigations: one on regulatory communications and one on our safety culture. We've -- the work we've undertaken to improve our safety culture over the past 4.5 years has been informed by significant benchmarking and input from experts from the outside. And we look forward to the opportunity to share our progress with the commission.
Moving to the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case. We completed hearings in March. PG&E presented a strong case informed by a detailed risk assessment of the assets across our system.
The next steps are opening briefs, which will be filed today, and then reply briefs on May 20.
The current schedule calls for a final decision in the rate case in August of 2015, with revenues retroactive to January 1. It's unclear at this point how the final penalty decision will impact the schedule. Last week, we received a proposed decision in the residential rate reform proceeding at the commission. The proposed decision acknowledges the need for fundamental rate reform and recommends reducing residential tiers from 4 to 2 over the next few years.
However, we were disappointed that it failed in the near term to adopt monthly charges to recover fixed costs. Fixed charges are a common element of many utilities' rates, and we continue to believe they can be implemented with minimal impact to customers and that the time is right to adopt them in California. We'll be filing comments on the proposed decision in May.
And finally, as we look forward in September of this year, we'll be filing our next General Rate Case, which will set forth our plans for gas and electric distribution and generation from 2017 through 2019.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

Today, I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for",1985,"Thanks, and good morning. Today, I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for 2015.
First, our quarterly results, which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.87 for the quarter. GAAP earnings, including our items impacting comparability, came in at $0.06. Obviously, our items impacting comparability drove much of the story for the quarter, so let me go through those.
Our pipeline-related expenses came in at $17 million pretax or $10 million after-tax as shown in the table. And here, we've included our cost to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way and some remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.
Our legal and regulatory expenses were $14 million pretax or $8 million after-tax in the table. These include costs incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communication.
Fines and penalties for the quarter totaled $553 million as shown in the table below. I'll walk you through the components of that.
First, the $300 million fine payable to the state resulted in a $100 million accrual in Q1. This is because we previously took a $200 million charge in 2011. Second, the $400 million customer bill credit was fully accrued in Q1. This reflects our obligation now to provide a credit to customers in February 2016. Third, the Q1 impact of the shareholder-funded safety improvements was a $53 million charge for disallowed capital, and I'm going to take a moment to explain that figure.
As you know, the final penalty decision calls for shareholders to fund $850 million of safety improvement to be determined in our 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case. This will consist of about $160 million of expense work and about $690 million of capital work.
We expect the CPUC to reduce the authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case for these disallowed costs.
In Q1, you see nothing here for disallowed expense work. This is because the item impacting comparability for the expense work will occur as the revenue is disallowed, not as the expenses are incurred. When we receive the final decision in the Gas Transmission Rate Case, we expect to book revenues retroactive to January 1, and the impact of the revenue disallowance will be reflected as an item impacting comparability at that time.
What you do see here is a $53 million charge for disallowed capital work. The item impacting comparability for capital occurs as the capital is incurred and written off.
I know that's complicated, so I'll reiterate it. Disallowed expense work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case. Disallowed capital work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the capital is spent. 
One more thing to keep mind. The CPUC has not yet determined which cost will count towards the $850 million of shareholder-funded safety work, so we've estimated which capital expenditures incurred during the quarter we think will qualify. Once eligibility is determined in the gas transmission rate case, we'll true up any differences as necessary.
Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operation. As you can see, we're going from $0.54 in Q1 last year to $0.87 in Q1 this year, and there are a number of factors. The largest impact, $0.21, is due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which we didn't receive until August last year.
The impact includes both higher cost recovery as well as the tax benefit associated with repairs. In addition, $0.05 of the Q1 increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and another $0.05 because we had a nuclear refueling outage in Q1 of last year, but not this year.
There were $0.04 associated with tax timing. We expect that to net to 0 by year-end. You also see $0.03 for the disposition of the remaining SolarCity shares and miscellaneous of about $0.05.
These positive factors were partially offset by $0.08 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case.
The case covers costs for work we previously included as items impacting comparability such as hydrostatic testing and integrity management. Until we are authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case, this work will now reduce earnings from operation. When we receive a final decision in the case, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1.
And then finally, we had $0.02 for higher shares during the quarter.
That completes my summary of the Q1 result, and I now like to move on to our outlook going forward.
The final penalty decision resolved a significant uncertainty for the company, particularly with respect to the fines and penalties to be borne by shareholders and our associated financing needs. Therefore, today, we are providing guidance for 2015 earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share.
I want to spend some time going through the key assumptions underlying our guidance, which are shown on Slide 7, and this should look familiar to you.
Starting in the upper left, you see that we're still assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year, consistent with our last call. In the upper right, you see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is still about $31 billion. We've actually adjusted the gas transmission range down by about $200 million to reflect the estimated 2015 impact of the capital disallowance and the final penalty decision.
Remember, this is average rate base for the year, so you only see about half of the full year impact of the disallowance. In the lower left, you see there are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective continues to be to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
The first bullet under the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case highlights the key assumption underlying our guidance, namely that we receive a reasonable decision in the case and that it is issued before the end of the year.
The current schedule calls for a final decision in August, but the judge has yet to determine how to address the shareholder-funded safety improvements mandated in the final penalty decision, and we don't know how that could impact the schedule.
If we do not receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case before year-end, we would not record the incremental revenues for 2015 until next year. If that were to occur, we estimate that it would reduce this year's earnings from operations by roughly $0.60 per share.
The second bullet under the rate case is a reminder that we've not sought recovery of certain corrosion and strength testing work in 2015 and beyond, and we previously indicated that these expenses, it averaged roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year period, although the amount may vary year-to-year.
Next is the tax benefits associated with the federal repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was $0.24, and we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude this year. After that, our -- the incentive revenues for things like our customer energy efficiency program and the impact of monetizing the remaining SolarCity shares, which occurred in Q1. 
And finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by below-the-line costs such as advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs and so forth.
Slide 8 summarizes our overall guidance. At the top, you see our 2015 guidance for earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Guidance for our items impacting comparability is shown below that and is broken down into the 3 categories. 
We've got more detail on these on Slide 9, so let's go there now, and I'll start at the top. You can see that we're reaffirming the estimated range for pipeline-related expenses of $100 million to $150 million. We're also reaffirming the estimated range for legal and regulatory-related expenses of $25 million to $75 million.
Next, we're establishing an estimate of roughly $1 billion in 2015 for fines and penalties associated with the final decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. You can see the key components in the table below.
The first 2, the fine payable to the state and the customer bill credit, were accrued in the first quarter. We estimate that charges for disallowed capital work will come to about $350 million for the year, roughly half of the total disallowed capital. We also believe we'll see the full $160 million of disallowed revenues for expense work in 2015, assuming we receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case before year-end.
This estimate does not include potential fines and penalties in the future such as any revenues disallowed in the gas transmission rate case as a penalty for ex parte communication.
Slide 10 shows you how to get from this $1 billion estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigation. Going from left to right, you see the costs incurred prior to this year, the estimated impact for 2015 and then, finally, the costs we expect to incur in future periods. The future items consist of charges for the disallowed capital next year as well as remedies specified in the final decision -- or final penalty decision. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We are now estimating our total equity needs for 2015 to be between $700 million and $800 million. This range is consistent with the guidance and assumptions I've walked you through this morning.
It compares with our prior estimate of $400 million to $600 million, which, of course, did not include the impact of the fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigation. As the slide indicates, the fines and penalties clearly drive up our equity needs for the year.
Going in the other direction though, our overall cash flows are a bit stronger due to items such as balancing account activity and timing of expenditures during the year. This has mitigated some of our equity needs for 2015.
Keep in mind that we typically issue about $300 million annually using our internal programs: our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment program. In addition, we issued $75 million in the first quarter using our continuous equity offering or dribble program. That would leave our remaining equity needs for the year at roughly $300 million to $400 million, and we're currently evaluating options for that.
By the way, we've updated the equity factors slide in the appendix to align with the components of the final penalty decision.
Slides 12 and 13 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. The CapEx numbers are the same you've seen before, and you can see that we expect 2016 to look fairly similar to 2015, depending primarily on the outcome of the gas transmission rate case. The authorized rate base numbers have been adjusted to reflect the capital disallowance resulting from the final penalty decision. The impact on 2016 average rate base is a reduction of about $500 million. Our average rate base is expected to grow to right around $33 billion in 2016, and the adjustment for the final penalty decision results in an 8% CAGR over 2014 as compared to 9% previously.
We plan to provide you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.
With that, I'll stop here, and we'll now open the lines for your questions."

Let me just make sure everybody's got the overall picture clearly, which that -- which is that the range is higher than we previously said because of the impact of the final penalty decision. But these other factors, mainly cash flows, have somewhat mitigated the overall increase. And our cash flows have improved somewhat and those do reduce our financing requirements. And really, a key factor is within our balancing account activities, and in particular, our energy procurement costs, which are lower primarily due to lower gas prices. They've stayed very low this year, lower than was reflected in previous expectations. And then the other thing is really kind of timing of our CapEx and our other expenditures. And together, those have really improved the cash flow forecast and reduced our requirement. Those will essentially normalize over time and play out over what is usually a several-year period, particularly balancing account stuff gets trued up usually over a several-year period."

The key thing I would rely on is Slide 20 that has our equity factors. I think you'll be able to essentially take the components in the final penalty decision and translate them into financing requirements. And I'll just say we haven't provided guidance for equity issuance beyond this year and I don't plan to today. But I'll kind of -- I can give you some observations about it overall. I think you know our equity needs are a function of a lot of variables in any one period. The 2 key ones are our capital expenditure levels and then our unrecovered costs and penalties. And that latter one can affect our -- both our capital structure and our cash flow. And so it can trigger equity needs at different times and that's really what this Slide 20 helps you sort through. In terms of those 2 factors, I'll just make the observation on the CapEx front. We expect 2016 to be pretty comparable to 2015, and you have those numbers. In terms of the penalties, we estimate that about 2/3 of our equity needs associated with the final penalty decision will be addressed this year as compared to next year, and you should be able to derive that using the equity factors that we've put in Slide 20. The only other thing I'll say, I'll just remind you that all of this depends on how the disallowed safety-related expenditures end up being treated in the gas transmission rate case, and we just won't know that for a while yet."

I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Chris and Kent to provide more detail on both operational and financial issues.As you know, we received a final penalty decision on the gas",671,"Thanks, Janet, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Chris and Kent to provide more detail on both operational and financial issues.
As you know, we received a final penalty decision on the gas transmission pipeline investigations earlier this month, which is a significant milestone. Following the San Bruno accident, we worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno. We've dedicated ourselves to becoming the safest and most reliable utility in the country.
We've been working to build a culture across the company that supports this mission. And we've completed an unprecedented level of work to improve the safety of our system, much of it funded by our shareholders.
So although the final penalty assessed by the commission is the largest in state history and certainly one of the largest in the country, we've decided not to appeal. We just don't feel that prolonging the proceeding is in anyone's interest.
As we move forward, I can assure you that the lessons from San Bruno will continue to guide us. The San Bruno accident has changed the way we look at everything, from the way we plan what work we do to the way we execute and document work in the field.
Safety starts at the top. It also requires the unequivocal commitment of every employee. My management team, our employees and the unions who represent them have all made that commitment and safety has been at the heart of our decisions and actions over the last several years.
I want to acknowledge that we still have a number of proceedings outstanding. On the legal front, a trial date in the federal criminal case has been set for March 8, 2016. As you know, state and federal prosecutors have been investigating potential ex parte communications with the CPUC as well.
There are also still several investigations at the commission, including a new investigation of our safety culture that President Picker announced at the last commission meeting. And in fact, we welcome a conversation about safety at PG&E. We're proud of the work we've done to date, and we know we still have a lot of work to do to reearn the trust of our customers and the commission.
Over the past several years, we've hired some of the best experts in the country to help guide our efforts. Adding to that list, this spring, we announced that we've hired Julie Kane as our new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reporting directly to me. Julie has deep compliance experience, largely in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry, and her mandate is to work with our Board of Directors and our leadership team to build a best-in-class compliance program.
As Chris will discuss, we had another solid quarter in our operations. We're in the third year of a rigorous risk assessment program that we use to develop our 5-year operational plan. And I've been really pleased to see that these plans become more robust every year.
And we continue to see strong opportunities for growth as we work to build a better California. In both gas and electric operations, we'll continue to upgrade the system with a focus on reducing risk and enhancing safety and reliability through physical improvements like replacing pipes and wires and using technology to respond to our customers' changing needs.
We're also working on an integrated clean energy plan, which we believe will offer strong support for Governor Brown's vision for reducing carbon emission.
In the coming years, we expect to see continued investment opportunities to support the interactive Grid of Things. This will facilitate the state's increasing reliance on intermittent renewables, electric vehicles, demand-side management tools and energy storage. We have a number of proceedings pending at the commission to address these changes to the electric grid and you can expect to see more about this in the future.
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris."

I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments. I'm going to start with safety, which is fundamental to the work that our crews do every day.
Over the past few years, we've worked to create an environment where all employees feel comfortable speaking up when something doesn't look right or they identify a potential safety risk.
We were gratified to see that this was one of the areas where we received the most positive feedback in our employee survey last year. By encouraging this find it and fix it mindset and recognizing employees who do speak up or stop jobs when safety is a concern, we're identifying and addressing issues early. We measure ourselves on a set of safety metrics associated with both public and employee safety, and you can see several of those in our appendix in the slide deck.
For example, we target responding to emergency gas calls within 21 minutes. During the first quarter, we had responders on-site within an average of less than 20 minutes. That's a level of performance toward the very top of the industry.
On the electric side, we target improvement every year in a number of sustained outages caused by downed wires. In the first quarter of this year, our results showed a nearly 25% improvement.
Over the past 5 years, safety metrics have been an increasing component of our variable compensation plan. In gas operations, we continue to do significant work on our pipeline system, testing, replacing and automating components. For several years, we have been diligently addressing the recommendations made by the NTSB following the San Bruno accident. The NTSB has closed 9 of the 12 recommendations. The remaining 3 recommendations, which involve strength testing, valve installation and control room procedures, are longer-term multiyear efforts and they continue to be on track.
In electric operations, we continue to see strong reliability performance with our customers experiencing fewer and shorter outages.
In California, ISO awarded us 2 of the 3 competitive transmission projects we submitted bids for last year, both of which are in our service territory.
As California enters its fourth year of drought, we're working hard to help the state meet this challenge by reducing water usage at our own facilities, encouraging customers to conserve by offering rebates for more efficient washers and agricultural pumps. We're stepping up our vegetation management activities to mitigate wildfire risk and improve access for firefighters. And we're managing water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer.
Shifting to regulatory matters. As Tony mentioned, the commission issued a $1.6 billion final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation, and Kent will take you through the specific components of that in a minute.
The commission also announced 2 new investigations: one on regulatory communications; and one on our safety culture. We've -- the work we've undertaken to improve our safety culture over the past 4.5 years has been informed by significant benchmarking and input from experts from the outside. And we look forward to the opportunity to share our progress with the commission.
Moving to the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case. We completed hearings in March. PG&E presented a strong case informed by a detailed risk assessment of the assets across our system.
The next steps are opening briefs, which will be filed today, and then reply briefs on May 20.
The current schedule calls for a final decision in the rate case in August of 2015, with revenues retroactive to January 1. It's unclear at this point how the final penalty decision will impact the schedule. Last week, we received a proposed decision in the residential rate reform proceeding at the commission. The proposed decision acknowledges the need for fundamental rate reform and recommends reducing residential tiers from 4 to 2 over the next few years.
However, we were disappointed that it failed in the near term to adopt monthly charges to recover fixed costs. Fixed charges are a common element of many utilities' rates, and we continue to believe they can be implemented with minimal impact to customers and that the time is right to adopt them in California. We'll be filing comments on the proposed decision in May.
And finally, as we look forward in September of this year, we'll be filing our next General Rate Case, which will set forth our plans for gas and electric distribution and generation from 2017 through 2019.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

Today, I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for",1985,"Thanks, and good morning. Today, I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for 2015.
First, our quarterly results, which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.87 for the quarter. GAAP earnings, including our items impacting comparability, came in at $0.06. Obviously, our items impacting comparability drove much of the story for the quarter, so let me go through those.
Our pipeline-related expenses came in at $17 million pretax or $10 million after-tax as shown in the table. And here, we've included our cost to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way and some remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.
Our legal and regulatory expenses were $14 million pretax or $8 million after-tax in the table. These include costs incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communication.
Fines and penalties for the quarter totaled $553 million as shown in the table below. I'll walk you through the components of that.
First, the $300 million fine payable to the state resulted in a $100 million accrual in Q1. This is because we previously took a $200 million charge in 2011. Second, the $400 million customer bill credit was fully accrued in Q1. This reflects our obligation now to provide a credit to customers in February 2016. Third, the Q1 impact of the shareholder-funded safety improvements was a $53 million charge for disallowed capital, and I'm going to take a moment to explain that figure.
As you know, the final penalty decision calls for shareholders to fund $850 million of safety improvement to be determined in our 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case. This will consist of about $160 million of expense work and about $690 million of capital work.
We expect the CPUC to reduce the authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case for these disallowed costs.
In Q1, you see nothing here for disallowed expense work. This is because the item impacting comparability for the expense work will occur as the revenue is disallowed, not as the expenses are incurred. When we receive the final decision in the Gas Transmission Rate Case, we expect to book revenues retroactive to January 1, and the impact of the revenue disallowance will be reflected as an item impacting comparability at that time.
What you do see here is a $53 million charge for disallowed capital work. The item impacting comparability for capital occurs as the capital is incurred and written off.
I know that's complicated, so I'll reiterate it. Disallowed expense work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case. Disallowed capital work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the capital is spent. 
One more thing to keep in mind. The CPUC has not yet determined which cost will count towards the $850 million of shareholder-funded safety work, so we've estimated which capital expenditures incurred during the quarter we think will qualify. Once eligibility is determined in the gas transmission rate case, we'll true up any differences as necessary.
Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparisons for earnings from operation. As you can see, we're going from $0.54 in Q1 last year to $0.87 in Q1 this year, and there are a number of factors. The largest impact, $0.21, is due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which we didn't receive until August last year.
The impact includes both higher cost recovery as well as the tax benefits associated with repairs. In addition, $0.05 of the Q1 increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and another $0.05 because we had a nuclear refueling outage in Q1 of last year, but not this year.
There were $0.04 associated with tax timing. We expect that to net to 0 by year-end. You also see $0.03 for the disposition of the remaining SolarCity shares and miscellaneous of about $0.05.
These positive factors were partially offset by $0.08 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case.
The case covers costs for work we previously included as items impacting comparability such as hydrostatic testing and integrity management. Until we are authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case, this work will now reduce earnings from operation. When we receive a final decision in the case, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1.
And then finally, we had $0.02 for higher shares during the quarter.
That completes my summary of the Q1 result, and I’d now like to move on to our outlook going forward.
The final penalty decision resolved a significant uncertainty for the company, particularly with respect to the fines and penalties to be borne by shareholders and/or associated financing needs. Therefore, today, we are providing guidance for 2015 earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share.
I want to spend some time going through the key assumptions underlying our guidance, which are shown on Slide 7, and this should look familiar to you.
Starting in the upper left, you see that we're still assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year, consistent with our last call. In the upper right, you see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is still about $31 billion. We've actually adjusted the gas transmission range down by about $200 million to reflect the estimated 2015 impact of the capital disallowance in the final penalty decision.
Remember, this is average rate base for the year, so you only see about half of the full year impact of the disallowance. In the lower left, you see there are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio.
At the bottom right of the slide, we list factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective continues to be to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here.
The first bullet under the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case highlights the key assumption underlying our guidance, namely that we receive a reasonable decision in the case and that it is issued before the end of the year.
The current schedule calls for a final decision in August, but the judge has yet to determine how to address the shareholder-funded safety improvements mandated in the final penalty decision, and we don't know how that could impact the schedule.
If we do not receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case before year-end, we would not record the incremental revenues for 2015 until next year. If that were to occur, we estimate that it would reduce this year's earnings from operations by roughly $0.60 per share.
The second bullet under the rate case is a reminder that we've not sought recovery of certain corrosion and strength testing work in 2015 and beyond, and we previously indicated that these expenses, it averaged roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year period, although the amount may vary year-to-year.
Next is the tax benefits associated with the federal repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was $0.24, and we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude this year. After that, our -- the incentive revenues for things like our customer energy efficiency program and the impact of monetizing the remaining SolarCity shares, which occurred in Q1. 
And finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by below-the-line costs such as advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs and so forth.
Slide 8 summarizes our overall guidance. At the top, you see our 2015 guidance for earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Guidance for our items impacting comparability is shown below that and is broken down into the 3 categories. 
We've got more detail on these on Slide 9, so let's go there now, and I'll start at the top. You can see that we're reaffirming the estimated range for pipeline-related expenses of $100 million to $150 million. We're also reaffirming the estimated range for legal and regulatory-related expenses of $25 million to $75 million.
Next, we're establishing an estimate of roughly $1 billion in 2015 for fines and penalties associated with the final decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. You can see the key components in the table below.
The first 2, the fine payable to the state and the customer bill credit, were accrued in the first quarter. We estimate that charges for disallowed capital work will come to about $350 million for the year, roughly half of the total disallowed capital. We also believe we'll see the full $160 million of disallowed revenues for expense work in 2015, assuming we receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case before year-end.
This estimate does not include potential fines and penalties in the future such as any revenues disallowed in the gas transmission rate case as a penalty for ex parte communication.
Slide 10 shows you how to get from this $1 billion estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigation. Going from left to right, you see the costs incurred prior to this year, the estimated impact for 2015 and then, finally, the costs we expect to incur in future periods. The future items consist of charges for the disallowed capital next year as well as remedies specified in the final decision -- or final penalty decision. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We are now estimating our total equity needs for 2015 to be between $700 million and $800 million. This range is consistent with the guidance and assumptions I've walked you through this morning.
It compares with our prior estimate of $400 million to $600 million, which, of course, did not include the impact of the fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigation. As the slide indicates, the fines and penalties clearly drive up our equity needs for the year.
Going in the other direction though, our overall cash flows are a bit stronger due to items such as balancing account activity and timing of expenditures during the year. This has mitigated some of our equity needs for 2015.
Keep in mind that we typically issue about $300 million annually using our internal programs: our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment program. In addition, we issued $75 million in the first quarter using our continuous equity offering or dribble program. That would leave our remaining equity needs for the year at roughly $300 million to $400 million, and we're currently evaluating options for that.
By the way, we've updated the equity factors slide in the appendix to align with the components of the final penalty decision.
Slides 12 and 13 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. The CapEx numbers are the same you've seen before, and you can see that we expect 2016 to look fairly similar to 2015, depending primarily on the outcome of the gas transmission rate case. The authorized rate base numbers have been adjusted to reflect the capital disallowance resulting from the final penalty decision. The impact on 2016 average rate base is a reduction of about $500 million. Our average rate base is expected to grow to right around $33 billion in 2016, and the adjustment for the final penalty decision results in an 8% CAGR over 2014 as compared to 9% previously.
We plan to provide you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.
With that, I'll stop here, and we'll now open the lines for your questions."

Let me just make sure everybody's got the overall picture clearly, which that -- which is that the range is higher than we previously said because of the impact of the final penalty decision. But these other factors, mainly cash flows, have somewhat mitigated the overall increase. And our cash flows have improved somewhat and those do reduce our financing requirements. And really, a key factor is within our balancing account activities, and in particular, our energy procurement costs, which are lower primarily due to lower gas prices. They've stayed very low this year, lower than was reflected in previous expectations. And then the other thing is really kind of timing of our CapEx and our other expenditures. And together, those have really improved the cash flow forecast and reduced our requirement. Those will essentially normalize over time and play out over what is usually a several-year period, particularly balancing account stuff gets trued up usually over a several-year period."

The key thing I would rely on is Slide 20 that has our equity factors. I think you'll be able to essentially take the components in the final penalty decision and translate them into financing requirements. And I'll just say we haven't provided guidance for equity issuance beyond this year and I don't plan to today. But I'll kind of -- I can give you some observations about it overall. I think you know our equity needs are a function of a lot of variables in any one period. The 2 key ones are our capital expenditure levels and then our unrecovered costs and penalties. And that latter one can affect our -- both our capital structure and our cash flow. And so it can trigger equity needs at different times and that's really what this Slide 20 helps you sort through. In terms of those 2 factors, I'll just make the observation on the CapEx front. We expect 2016 to be pretty comparable to 2015, and you have those numbers. In terms of the penalties, we estimate that about 2/3 of our equity needs associated with the final penalty decision will be addressed this year as compared to next year, and you should be able to derive that using the equity factors that we've put in Slide 20. The only other thing I'll say, I'll just remind you that all of this depends on how the disallowed safety-related expenditures end up being treated in the gas transmission rate case, and we just won't know that for a while yet."

The biggest driver is related to the net benefit of the repairs, the tax benefit. And we've indicated that we would expected this year to have an impact that's comparable, same order of magnitude the last year when it was $0.24 a share."

We hired a number of third-party experts to come in and look at safety culture from a former head of the NTSB to Lloyd's Registry in London, who's done work under ISO 55000. And things like changing our discipline policy to encourage employees to identify safety issues to a program to identify near hits, as we call them, on safety, that has greatly expanded our understanding of where the risks are in the company.

I'm going to start by covering the leadership changes that we announced recently and also provide some regulatory updates. Chris will talk about operational results and Kent will cover our financials later. 
So a couple of weeks ago, we announced that Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos will be assuming the role of the presidents of electric and gas operations, respectively, effective August 17. 
First, I really do want to take Chris for his leadership at PG&E. Chris has been a passionate sponsor of our efforts to improve the safety culture at PG&E and since I arrived almost four years ago, he has been a great partner for me in improving PG&E's operations. So thank you, Chris for all that you've done. 
Geisha Williams joined PG&E in 2007 from Florida Power and Light, and under her leadership, PG&E has dramatically improved its electric reliability while managing the increasingly complex demands on our grid. 
Nick Stavropoulus joined PG&E in 2011 from National Grid and under his leadership PG&E has completed an unprecedented amount of work to improve the safety of our gas systems and has employed new innovative technologies that are literally changing the industry. 
Geisha and Nick are both here with us today and they will be available to answer any questions that you've got. While we're proud of the progress we've made today, we also know that we have more work to do. We remain focused on continuing the strength in our safety culture, resolving the remaining San Bruno-related proceedings and rebuilding trust with our stakeholders including the CPUC. 
We're also focused on planning for California's clean energy future and we've had a number of significant developments on that front since our last call that I'd like to touch on now. 
Earlier this month, we filed our electric distribution resources plan. This plan outlines our strategy for continuing to enable California's ambitious environmental goals by building a flexible, reliable grid that meets the growing demands for distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and energy storage. 
We've been investing in grid monetization for several years now and will include the next round of investments in our 2017 General Rate Case filing that will come in September. 
Earlier this month, the CPUC also approved changes to our residential rates that will reduce the number of tiers from 4 to 2, decrease the differential between the tiers and establish a $10 minimum bill for most customers. 
While this is an important first step, we believe that additional rate reform is critical to fully realize the state's objectives and ensure that all customers are appropriately paying for the use of the electric grid. We were a little disappointed that the commission didn't adopt fixed charges, but we're encouraged that the final decision recognized the importance of cost-based rates to send the appropriate price signals. We'll be proposing additional enhancements in the future to bring us closer to that goal. 
We'll also be submitting our proposal for new net energy metering rates next week, which is another important component of aligning rates with costs. 
Solar is an essential part of California's clean energy future, but we need smart energy reform for it to grow sustainably. The CPUC also issued a revised schedule in our Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case. We'll now have 2 separate positions, one that decides what costs are authorized and then a second decision that decides how we will apply the $850 million San Bruno penalty for safety-related work, and Kent is going to discuss the financial implications of that new schedule in just a moment. 
Finally, today, we filed our TO17 rate case. Our request was about $300 million higher than TO16. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris."

Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter in operations. We continue to perform well in our public safety metrics, in fact, we've reduce the number of wires downed and gas diggings across our system and responding to emergencies in an industry-leading pace. 
In line, pipeline inspections and upgrades are a little behind due to permitting delays, but we anticipate catching up by the end of the year, and Diablo Canyon continues to perform very well. 
You can see our overall performance on key metrics in the appendices. In May, we successfully conducted a 2-day large scale exercise to test our preparedness and response plans for major earthquake. It was our most ambitious exercise to date with over 750 employees and nearly a dozen external stakeholders participating across our servie territory. 
Exercises like these, along with our emergency preparedness efforts, help us to be ready to respond quickly and effectively when an event happens. 
With California in its fourth year of severe drought, our electric operations team has significantly enhanced our efforts to prevent wildfires. We're conducting daily aerial fire patrols across our service territory and we've partnered with federal and state agencies like Calfire and the U.S. forest service to create more fire breaks, improve emergency response and fund the cameras that will help detect wildfires in remote locations. 
We're also continuing to manage water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer. In early July, the CPUC released the results of an independent report on the Fresno pipeline incident, which found that the pipeline ruptured when it was struck by third-party construction equipment. 
The report also confirmed that the pipe met all industry specifications and that the construction activity significantly reduced the depth of soil around the pipeline. This incident highlights the importance of calling 811 before digging and we've been working hard to make sure all of our customers are aware of this free service. 
We're continuing to cooperate with the CPUC in its ongoing investigation and our thoughts remain with the victims and the families of this accident. Finally, earlier this quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board announced that PG&E had successfully completed the 10th of 12 safety recommendations for the improvements we've made to the system that monitors and provides real time data about our gas pipelines. 
The 2 remaining recommendations, which involves strength testing and valve installation, are proceeding appropriately. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

I'll start with our quarterly results which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings, which include our items impacting comparability were $0.83. Our pipe",1055,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with our quarterly results which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings, which include our items impacting comparability were $0.83. Our pipeline-related expenses totaled $15 million pretax or $9 million after-tax as shown in the table. 
This includes our costs to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way and some remaining expense work for our pipeline safety enhancement plan. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses totaled $16 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in the table. 
Here we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. Fines and penalties for the second quarter totaled $75 million pretax as shown in the table below. You can see the Q2 charge with for disallowed capital work coming out of the final penalty decision in the San Bruno investigations. 
Disallowed capital work will continue to be recorded as an item impacting comparability in future period as the capital is spent, but disallowed expense work won't be reflected as an item impacting comparability until the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case. So the timing there will be linked to the final decision. 
Finally, as you can see in the table above, we received insurance recoveries during the quarter of $39 million pretax or $23 million after-tax in the table. This brings our total insurance recoveries for third-party claims to $505 million pretax. 
Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the key factors that take us from $0.69 in Q2 last year to $0.91 in Q2 this year. $0.21 of the increase was due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which you remember we didn't receive until Q3 of last year. 
In addition, $0.05 of the increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and $0.04 was associated with tax timing. We expect the tax timing to reverse to 0 by year end. We also had $0.06 positive in miscellaneous smaller items. 
These factors were partially offset by $0.09 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the GAAP transmission rate case. As you know, the revenue increase from a final decision in the case will be retroactive to January 1. It was also $0.03 attributable to the disposition of stock in SolarCity in Q2 last year and $0.02 attributable to an increase in shares outstanding. 
That's it for our Q2 results. I'll now move on to our 2013 -- 2015 guidance summarized on Slide 7. As Tony mentioned, the CPUC issued a revised schedule in the gas transmission rate case. Since it now appears likely that the case will not be resolved until 2016, we don't expect to be able to book additional gas transmission revenue for this year. 
I indicated on our last call that not receiving a final rate case decision in 2015 would impact earnings from operations this year by about $0.60 per share. 
Accordingly, we're adjusting our guidance for 2015 earnings from operations to reflect this delay, which takes us to a range of $290 million to $310 million for this year. The prior range rate was $350 million to $370 million. Since the final decision will be retroactive to January 1, 2015, this is just a timing issue. And next year, we would expect to book incremental revenues for both 2015 and 2016. 
We plan to treat the 2015 amount as an item impacting comparability next year and the 2016 amount will be included in our operating results. The delay on the rate case decision affects 2 of the assumptions underlying our 2015 earnings guidance. So I wanted to just briefly touch on those and then we'll come back to the items impacting comparability. 
On Slide 8, we've adjusted our 2015 CapEx for gas transmission given the delay in the case. We're now showing $650 million versus our previous range of $600 million to $800 million. We've also reduced our 2015 authorized rate base for gas transmission to $1.8 billion since the increase in authorized rate base won't occur until next year when we get a final decision. The other assumptions here are unchanged from last quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9 the ranges to the item impacting comparability are also unchanged from last quarter with the exception of the fines and penalties which we reduced from roughly $1 billion to about $900 million for 2015. 
The delay in the gas transmission rate case means we will not record disallowed expense work until next year when we get the decision. We previously had $160 million in 2015 guidance for that. 
Partially offsetting that change, we've increased our 2015 estimate for disallowed capital by about $50 million to $400 million. The net of these 2 changes is a reduction in 2015 fines and penalties of about $100 million. 
I also need to remind you here that our estimate does not include other potential fines and penalties such as any revenues disallowed in the gas transmission rate case as a penalty for ex parte communications. 
Finally, in the table above, we've also updated it to reflect the receipt of the insurance recoveries that we booked in Q2. 
Slide 10 just shows you how you get from the roughly $900 million estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigations. This table has been updated to reflect the timing changes I just covered. 
Moving on to slide 11. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain unchanged between $700 million and $800 million. In the second quarter, we issued about $100 million of equity through our internal programs, which include our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment program and we expect to issue a total of roughly $300 million through these programs for the full year. 
We previously issued about $75 million through our continuous equity offering leaving the remaining need for the year of about $300 million to $400 million and that's unchanged from last quarter. 
Slides 12 and 13 just summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. Other than the change to 2015 authorized rate base, which I've already covered, the numbers are unchanged from last quarter. 
With that, I'll stop here and we can open up the lines for your questions."

One is you're right, the GT&S case has been delayed into early next year, but we weren't anticipating it to actually happen anyway until very late this year. So it really only affected our equity balances for a few months this year. So moving it out, out of this year isn't a big 2015 impact on our equity. And then in the other direction, of course, we're not expecting to have the charge for the disallowed expense work this year and previously we were.

It's very hard to look on our balance sheet and really decide for all the things that are going on because we have longer-term balancing accounts and shorter-term loans. Sometimes the trends have to do with prior year and then reversing them. Sometimes then have to do it what's going on in the current period and they amortize over different periods.

I'm going to start by covering the leadership changes that we announced recently and also provide some regulatory updates. Chris will talk about operational results and Kent will cover our financials later.
So a couple of weeks ago, we announced that Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos will be assuming the role of the presidents of electric and gas operations, respectively, effective August 17.
First, I really do want to thanks Chris for his leadership at PG&E. Chris has been a passionate sponsor of our efforts to improve the safety culture at PG&E. And since I arrived almost four years ago, he has been a great partner for me in improving PG&E's operations. So thank you, Chris, for all that you've done.
Geisha Williams joined PG&E in 2007 from Florida Power & Light. And under her leadership, PG&E has dramatically improved its electric reliability while managing the increasingly complex demands on our grid.
Nick Stavropoulos joined PG&E in 2011 from National Grid. And under his leadership, PG&E has completed an unprecedented amount of work to improve the safety of our gas system and has employed new innovative technologies that are literally changing the industry.
Geisha and Nick are both here with us today and they will be available to answer any questions that you've got. While we're proud of the progress we've made today, we also know that we have more work to do. We remain focused on continuing to strengthen our safety culture, resolving the remaining San Bruno-related proceedings and rebuilding trust with our stakeholders, including the CPUC.
We're also focused on planning for California's clean energy future, and we've had a number of significant developments on that front since our last call that I'd like to touch on now.
Earlier this month, we filed our electric distribution resources plan. This plan outlines our strategy for continuing to enable California's ambitious environmental goals by building a flexible, reliable grid that meets the growing demands for distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and energy storage.
We've been investing in grid monetization for several years now and will include the next round of investments in our 2017 General Rate Case filing that will come in September.
Earlier this month, the CPUC also approved changes to our residential rates that will reduce the number of tiers from 4 to 2, decrease the differential between the tiers and establish a $10 minimum bill for most customers.
While this is an important first step, we believe that additional rate reform is critical to fully realize the state's objectives and ensure that all customers are appropriately paying for the use of the electric grid. We were a little disappointed that the commission didn't adopt fixed charges, but we're encouraged that the final decision recognized the importance of cost-based rates to send the appropriate price signals. We'll be proposing additional enhancements in the future to bring us closer to that goal.
We'll also be submitting our proposal for new net energy metering rates next week, which is another important component of aligning rates with costs.
Solar is an essential part of California's clean energy future, but we need smart energy reform for it to grow sustainably. The CPUC also issued a revised schedule in our Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case. We'll now have 2 separate decisions, one that decides what costs are authorized and then a second decision that decides how we will apply the $850 million San Bruno penalty for safety-related work. And Kent is going to discuss the financial implications of that new schedule in just a minute.
Finally, today, we filed our TO17 rate case. Our request was about $300 million higher than TO16. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris."

Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter in operations. We continue to perform well in our public safety metrics, in fact, we've reduced the number of wires down and gas dig-ins across our system and responding to emergencies in an industry-leading pace.
In-line pipeline inspections and upgrades are a little behind due to permitting delays, but we anticipate catching up by the end of the year. And Diablo Canyon continues to perform very well.
You can see our overall performance on key metrics in the appendices. In May, we successfully conducted a 2-day large scale exercise to test our preparedness and response plans for a major earthquake. It was our most ambitious exercise to date with over 750 employees and nearly a dozen external stakeholders participating across our service territory.
Exercises like these, along with our many other emergency preparedness efforts, help us to be ready to respond quickly and effectively when an event happens.
With California in its fourth year of severe drought, our electric operations team has significantly enhanced our efforts to prevent wildfires. We're conducting daily aerial fire patrols across our service territory and we've partnered with federal and state agencies like CAL FIRE and the U.S. Forest Service to create more fire breaks, improve emergency response and fund the cameras that will help detect wildfires in remote locations.
We're also continuing to manage water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer. In early July, the CPUC released the results of an independent report on the Fresno pipeline incident, which found that the pipeline ruptured when it was struck by a third-party construction equipment.
The report also confirmed that the pipe met all industry specifications and that the construction activity significantly reduced the depth of soil around the pipeline. This incident highlights the importance of calling 811 before digging and we've been working hard to make sure all of our customers are aware of this free service.
We're continuing to cooperate with the CPUC in its ongoing investigation and our thoughts remain with the victims and families of this accident. Finally, earlier this quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board announced that PG&E had successfully completed the 10th of 12 safety recommendations for the improvements we've made to the system that monitors and provides real-time data about our gas pipelines.
The 2 remaining recommendations, which involves strength testing and valve installation, are proceeding appropriately. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

I'll start with our quarterly results which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings, which include our items impacting comparability, were $0.83. Our pip",1054,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with our quarterly results which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings, which include our items impacting comparability, were $0.83. Our pipeline-related expenses totaled $15 million pretax or $9 million after-tax as shown in the table.
This includes our costs to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way and some remaining expense work for our pipeline safety enhancement plan. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses totaled $16 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in the table.
Here, we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. Fines and penalties for the second quarter totaled $75 million pretax as shown in the table below. You can see the Q2 charge was for disallowed capital work coming out of the final penalty decision in the San Bruno investigations.
Disallowed capital work will continue to be recorded as an item impacting comparability in future period as the capital is expensed, but disallowed expense work won't be reflected as an item impacting comparability until the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case, so the timing there will be linked to the final decision.
Finally, as you can see in the table above, we received insurance recoveries during the quarter of $39 million pretax or $23 million after-tax in the table. This brings our total insurance recoveries for third-party claims to $505 million pretax.
Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the key factors that take us from $0.69 in Q2 last year to $0.91 in Q2 this year. $0.21 of the increase was due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which you remember we didn't receive until Q3 of last year.
In addition, $0.05 of the increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and $0.04 was associated with tax timing. We expect the tax timing to reverse to 0 by year-end. We also had $0.06 positive in miscellaneous smaller items.
These factors were partially offset by $0.09 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case. As you know, the revenue increase from a final decision in the case will be retroactive to January 1. There was also $0.03 attributable to the disposition of stock in SolarCity in Q2 last year and $0.02 attributable to an increase in shares outstanding.
That's it for our Q2 results. I'll now move on to our 2013 -- 2015 guidance summarized on Slide 7. As Tony mentioned, the CPUC issued a revised schedule in the gas transmission rate case. Since it now appears likely that the case will not be resolved until 2016, we don't expect to be able to book additional gas transmission revenue for this year.
I indicated on our last call that not receiving a final rate case decision in 2015 would impact earnings from operations this year by about $0.60 per share.
Accordingly, we're adjusting our guidance for 2015 earnings from operations to reflect this delay, which takes us to a range of $290 million to $310 million for this year. The prior range was $350 million to $370 million. Since the final decision will be retroactive to January 1, 2015, this is just a timing issue. And next year, we would expect to book incremental revenues for both 2015 and 2016.
We plan to treat the 2015 amount as an item impacting comparability next year and the 2016 amount will be included in our operating results. The delay on the rate case decision affects 2 of the assumptions underlying our 2015 earnings guidance. So I wanted to just briefly touch on those and then we'll come back to the items impacting comparability.
On Slide 8, we've adjusted our 2015 CapEx for gas transmission given the delay in the case. We're now showing $650 million versus our previous range of $600 million to $800 million. We've also reduced our 2015 authorized rate base for gas transmission to $1.8 billion since the increase in authorized rate base won't occur until next year when we get a final decision. The other assumptions here are unchanged from last quarter.
Moving to Slide 9. The ranges to the item impacting comparability are also unchanged from last quarter with the exception of the fines and penalties, which we reduced from roughly $1 billion to about $900 million for 2015.
The delay in the gas transmission rate case means we will not record disallowed expense work until next year when we get the decision. We previously had $160 million in 2015 guidance for that.
Partially offsetting that change, we've increased our 2015 estimate for disallowed capital by about $50 million to $400 million. The net of these 2 changes is a reduction in 2015 fines and penalties of about $100 million.
I also need to remind you here that our estimate does not include other potential fines and penalties such as any revenues disallowed in the gas transmission rate case as a penalty for ex parte communications.
Finally, in the table above, we've also updated it to reflect the receipt of the insurance recoveries that we booked in Q2.
Slide 10 just shows you how you get from the roughly $900 million estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigations. This table has been updated to reflect the timing changes I just covered.
Moving on to Slide 11. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain unchanged at between $700 million and $800 million. In the second quarter, we issued about $100 million of equity through our internal programs, which include our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment program, and we expect to issue a total of roughly $300 million through these programs for the full year.
We previously issued about $75 million through our continuous equity offering leaving the remaining need for the year at about $300 million to $400 million, and that's unchanged from last quarter.
Slides 12 and 13 just summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. Other than the change to 2015 authorized rate base, which I've already covered, the numbers are unchanged from last quarter.
With that, I'll stop here and we can open up the lines for your questions."

But obviously, given the capital investment that we're our making, we continue to see upward movement on our rates and -- but we're sensitive to the subsidies. And I think the net energy metering proposal that we'll make will try and bring more in line the amount we're paying for the solar that we're receiving in line with the value to the rest of the customers so that it reduces the subsidies.

I'm going to start by covering the leadership changes that we announced recently and also provide some regulatory updates. Chris will talk about operational results and Kent will cover our financials later.
So a couple of weeks ago, we announced that Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos will be assuming the roles as the presidents of electric and gas operations, respectively, effective August 17.
First, I really do want to thanks Chris for his leadership at PG&E. Chris has been a passionate sponsor of our efforts to improve the safety culture at PG&E. And since I arrived almost four years ago, he has been a great partner for me in improving PG&E's operations. So thank you, Chris, for all that you've done.
Geisha Williams joined PG&E in 2007 from Florida Power & Light. And under her leadership, PG&E has dramatically improved its electric reliability while managing the increasingly complex demands on our grid.
Nick Stavropoulos joined PG&E in 2011 from National Grid. And under his leadership, PG&E has completed an unprecedented amount of work to improve the safety of our gas system and has employed new innovative technologies that are literally changing the industry.
Geisha and Nick are both here with us today and they will be available to answer any questions that you've got. While we're proud of the progress we've made to date, we also know that we have more work to do. We remain focused on continuing to strengthen our safety culture, resolving the remaining San Bruno-related proceedings and rebuilding trust with our stakeholders, including the CPUC.
We're also focused on planning for California's clean energy future, and we've had a number of significant developments on that front since our last call that I'd like to touch on now.
Earlier this month, we filed our electric distribution resources plan. This plan outlines our strategy for continuing to enable California's ambitious environmental goals by building a flexible, reliable grid that meets the growing demands for distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and energy storage.
We've been investing in grid monetization for several years now and will include the next round of investments in our 2017 General Rate Case filing that will come in September.
Earlier this month, the CPUC also approved changes to our residential rates that will reduce the number of tiers from 4 to 2, decrease the differential between the tiers and establish a $10 minimum bill for most customers.
While this is an important first step, we believe that additional rate reform is critical to fully realize the state's objectives and ensure that all customers are appropriately paying for the use of the electric grid. We were a little disappointed that the commission didn't adopt fixed charges, but we're encouraged that the final decision recognized the importance of cost-based rates to send the appropriate price signals. We'll be proposing additional enhancements in the future to bring us closer to that goal.
We'll also be submitting our proposal for new net energy metering rates next week, which is another important component of aligning rates with costs.
Solar is an essential part of California's clean energy future, but we need smart energy reform for it to grow sustainably. The CPUC also issued a revised schedule in our Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case. We'll now have 2 separate decisions, one that decides what costs are authorized and then a second decision that decides how we will apply the $850 million San Bruno penalty for safety-related work. And Kent is going to discuss the financial implications of that new schedule in just a minute.
Finally, today, we filed our TO17 rate case. Our request was about $300 million higher than TO16. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris."

We had another strong quarter in operations. We continue to perform well in our public safety metrics. In fact, we've reduced the number of wires down and gas dig-ins across our system and we're responding to emergencies in an industry-leading pace.
In-line pipeline inspections and upgrades are a little behind due to permitting delays, but we anticipate catching up by the end of the year. And Diablo Canyon continues to perform very well.
You can see our overall performance on key metrics in the appendices. In May, we successfully conducted a 2-day large-scale exercise to test our preparedness and response plans for a major earthquake. It was our most ambitious exercise to date with over 750 employees and nearly a dozen external stakeholders participating across our service territory.
Exercises like these, along with our many other emergency preparedness efforts, help us to be ready to respond quickly and effectively when an event happens.
With California in its fourth year of severe drought, our electric operations team has significantly enhanced our efforts to prevent wildfires. We're conducting daily aerial fire patrols across our service territory and we've partnered with federal and state agencies like CAL FIRE and the U.S. Forest Service to create more fire breaks, improve emergency response and fund the cameras that will help detect wildfires in remote locations.
We're also continuing to manage water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer. In early July, the CPUC released the results of an independent report on the Fresno pipeline incident, which found that the pipeline ruptured when it was struck by third-party construction equipment.
The report also confirmed that the pipe met all industry specifications and that the construction activity significantly reduced the depth of soil around the pipeline. This incident highlights the importance of calling 811 before digging and we've been working hard to make sure all of our customers are aware of this free service.
We're continuing to cooperate with the CPUC in its ongoing investigation and our thoughts remain with the victims and families of this accident. Finally, earlier this quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board announced that PG&E had successfully completed the 10th of 12 safety recommendations for the improvements we've made to the system that monitors and provides real-time data about our gas pipelines.
The 2 remaining recommendations, which involves strength testing and valve installation, are proceeding appropriately. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

I'll start with our quarterly results which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings, which include our items impacting comparability, were $0.83. Our pip",1050,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with our quarterly results which are summarized on Slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings, which include our items impacting comparability, were $0.83. Our pipeline-related expenses totaled $15 million pretax or $9 million after-tax as shown in the table.
This includes our costs to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way and some remaining expense work for our pipeline safety enhancement plan. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses totaled $16 million pretax or $10 million after-tax in the table.
Here, we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. Fines and penalties for the second quarter totaled $75 million pretax as shown in the table below. You can see the Q2 charge was for disallowed capital work coming out of the final penalty decision in the San Bruno investigations.
Disallowed capital work will continue to be recorded as an item impacting comparability in future period as the capital is expensed. But disallowed expense work won't be reflected as an item impacting comparability until the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case, so the timing there will be linked to the final decision.
Finally, as you can see in the table above, we received insurance recoveries during the quarter of $39 million pretax or $23 million after-tax in the table. This brings our total insurance recoveries for third-party claims to $505 million pretax.
Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the key factors that take us from $0.69 in Q2 last year to $0.91 in Q2 this year. $0.21 of the increase was due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which you'll remember we didn't receive until Q3 of last year.
In addition, $0.05 of the increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and $0.04 was associated with tax timing. We expect the tax timing to reverse to 0 by year-end. We also had $0.06 positive in miscellaneous smaller items.
These factors were partially offset by $0.09 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the Gas Transmission Rate Case. As you know, the revenue increase from a final decision in the case will be retroactive to January 1. There was also $0.03 attributable to the disposition of stock in SolarCity in Q2 last year and $0.02 attributable to an increase in shares outstanding.
That's it for our Q2 results. I'll now move on to our 2013 -- 2015 guidance summarized on Slide 7. As Tony mentioned, the CPUC issued a revised schedule in the Gas Transmission Rate Case. Since it now appears likely that the case will not be resolved until 2016, we don't expect to be able to book additional gas transmission revenue for this year.
I indicated on our last call that not receiving a final rate case decision in 2015 would impact earnings from operations this year by about $0.60 per share.
Accordingly, we're adjusting our guidance for 2015 earnings from operations to reflect this delay, which takes us to a range of $2.90 to $3.10 for this year. The prior range was $3.50 to $3.70. Since the final decision will be retroactive to January 1, 2015, this is just a timing issue. And next year, we would expect to book incremental revenues for both 2015 and 2016.
We plan to treat the 2015 amount as an item impacting comparability next year and the 2016 amount will be included in our operating results. The delay on the rate case decision affects 2 of the assumptions underlying our 2015 earnings guidance. So I wanted to just briefly touch on those and then we'll come back to the items impacting comparability.
On Slide 8, we've adjusted our 2015 CapEx for gas transmission given the delay in the case. We're now showing $650 million versus a previous range of $600 million to $800 million. We've also reduced our 2015 authorized rate base for gas transmission to $1.8 billion since the increase in authorized rate base won't occur until next year when we get a final decision. The other assumptions here are unchanged from last quarter.
Moving to Slide 9. The ranges for the items impacting comparability are also unchanged from last quarter with the exception of the fines and penalties, which we've reduced from roughly $1 billion to about $900 million for 2015.
The delay in the Gas Transmission Rate Case means we will not report disallowed expense work until next year when we get the decision. We previously had $160 million in 2015 guidance for that.
Partially offsetting that change, we've increased our 2015 estimate for disallowed capital by about $50 million to $400 million. The net of these 2 changes is a reduction in 2015 fines and penalties of about $100 million.
I also need to remind you here that our estimate does not include other potential fines and penalties such as any revenues disallowed in the Gas Transmission Rate Case as a penalty for ex parte communications.
Finally, in the table above, we've also updated it to reflect the receipt of the insurance recoveries that we booked in Q2.
Slide 10 just shows you how you get from the roughly $900 million estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigations. This table has been updated to reflect the timing changes I just covered.
Moving on to Slide 11. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain unchanged at between $700 million and $800 million. In the second quarter, we issued about $100 million of equity through our internal programs, which include our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment program, and we expect to issue a total of roughly $300 million through these programs for the full year.
We previously issued about $75 million through our continuous equity offering leaving the remaining need for the year at about $300 million to $400 million, and that's unchanged from last quarter.
Slides 12 and 13 just summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. Other than the change to 2015 authorized rate base, which I've already covered, the numbers are unchanged from last quarter.
With that, I'll stop here and we can open up the lines for your questions."

Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged.

Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged. California continues to lead the U.S. in driving clean energy policies, and PG&E will play a critical role in helping to achieve the state's goals. We also know that safety must be at the core of all of our decisions, and our commitment to that is unwavering. 
We continue to make progress towards resolving outstanding regulatory and legal issues while strengthening our safety and compliance programs. We believe that executing our strategies in these focus areas will provide the foundation for both operational and financial success. So I want to touch on some of the key developments this quarter before I turn it over to Kent to discuss our financial results. Geisha [ph] Williams and [indiscernible] are also with us today and they'll be available to take any questions that you have. In terms of our focus on clean energy. 
PG&E has a long history of action in climate change and we've been a vocal advocate for policies that will move it forward. In fact, I recently participated in a meeting with President Obama to talk about the actions PG&E is taking to help drive clean energy policy in greenhouse gas reductions. We supported Governor Brown's recent move to increase the renewable energy target to 50% by 2030, and we're confident that we can get there.
We've been investing in the electric grid to enable both utility scale renewable and the growing distributed resources such as root [indiscernible] solar, electric vehicle and energy storage. During the quarter, we filed our proposal to update the current net metering rates. Our proposal supports the continued growth of root [indiscernible] solar while beginning to transition to a sustainable rate structure that also supports the necessary grid investments.
Our 2017 General Rate Case includes detailed proposals for continued grid modernization to ensure that we have the visibility and flexibility we'll need to enable all of the new distributed resources. Our General Rate Case also supports our goal on delivering customer expectations by providing customers with safe, reliable and affordable service.
Using a risk-based approach, we propose safety-related investments across the system including replacing aging infrastructure, taking targeted actions to reduce risk and improving our emergency response. And we balance the necessary investment with affordability. Average residential bills will increase less than 3% and will remain below the national average.
In terms of reliability, the most significant event this quarter were the fires in North Carolina. As you know, California is in its fourth year of severe drought, and we've been partnering throughout the with Cal Fire and other stakeholders to address the challenging fire season. Our efforts have included things like increased patrols in vegetation management as well as enhanced emergency response coordination. At one point, the state was simultaneously fighting 3 major wildfires across 300,000 acres of our service territory. In addition to restoring power to impacted customers, our crews came up with creative ways to meet our communities' need in a very challenging time. So for example, we leveraged the new explorable power technology from our electric trucks to provide an evacuation shelter with backup electricity when its generator failed. The response from our customers and other stakeholders has been positive, and we're really proud of how safely and quickly our crews were able to perform the work.
As we publicly reported, Cal Fire is investigating whether one of our electric lines could potentially have been the source of the fire. That investigation is still underway and could quite a while to complete, so we don't have any updates on that at this time. 
On the heels of the state's historic drought, we're now hearing forecast about an El Niño winter, which could bring significant rainfall and cause mudslides and floods. Our team has been preparing for this possibility through a wide array of actions including updated our meteorological models and performing drills that simulate potential flood scenarios.
Finally in terms of resolving outstanding regulatory issues, we recently received a report from the safety enforcement division, the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. While the report identified the number of potential past violations which we'll be responding to in the next month, we were pleased to see they also acknowledged the progress we've made to improve our records. Over the last 2 years, we've implemented a number of new procedures that have been informed by extensive benchmarking and industry best practices. As we said from the beginning, we know we have more work to do to enhance our distribution records and practices and we're absolutely committed to getting that right.
Geisha and Nick recently had a chance to share some of the actions we've taken to improve our safety culture at the California Public Utilities Commission's first every safety en banc. This was an opportunity for all 5 commissioners, the presidents of California's investor-owned utilities and a number of interveners to talk about what each of the utilities is currently doing around safety and what changes the commission might make to better incorporate safety into its proceedings. Nick and Geisha talked about the changes made by our Board of Directors to focus on safety, the strong link between our executive compensation programs and safety performance, our use of third-party experts in benchmarking and the way we engage our frontline crews around safety. The commission also had the opportunity here from other utilities and start thinking about how to create common metrics to track and measure progress. I can tell you that we thought it was a really positive step forward in the conversation, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all the parties.
So before I turn this over to Kent, I just want to take a moment to thank him for all that he's done for PG&E. As you know, after 33 years with the company, Kent has decided to retire next year. Kent has done a tremendous job managing PG&E's financial activities during challenges that were some of the most complex in our industry. He's also been a great source of leadership and inspiration across the company. We're working through the succession process right now, and I'm thankful that Kent has agreed to stay on to ensure a smooth transition. 
So thank you, Kent. And with, I'll turn it over to you."
139813,312693538,883685,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. I plan to first cover our results for the quarter, and then I'll go through our updated guidance. Let me say up front that the complexity of our rate case timing issues has made it especially difficult for you to f",994,"Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. I plan to first cover our results for the quarter, and then I'll go through our updated guidance. Let me say up front that the complexity of our rate case timing issues has made it especially difficult for you to forecast quarterly results. However, we do expect solid results for the full year, and you'll see that when I get to guidance.
So I'll start with our quarterly results, which is on Slide 5. Earnings from operations were $0.84 in the third quarter and GAAP earnings including our items impacting comparability were $0.63. Our pipeline-related expenses in the quarter were $32 million pretax or $19 million after-tax shown in the table. This includes our cost to remediate encroachments in our pipeline rights of way and to complete the remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses in the quarter were $14 million pretax or $8 million after-tax in the table, and here we have our cost for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications
Fines and penalties in the quarter were $142 million pretax as shown in the table below. This amount represents the [indiscernible] capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which were accruing as we do the work. 
Finally, we received insurance recoveries in the quarter of $10 million pretax or $6 million after-tax as shown in the table above. I'm pleased that we now resolved all San Bruno claims with our insurance carriers, and in total, we recovered $515 million through insurance.
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $1.73 in Q3 last year and $0.84 in Q3 this year, and this is where it gets a little complicated due to all the timing issues. In Q3 last year, we recorded 3 quarters' worth of revenue increase associated with our 2014 General Rate Case. That's the biggest difference from Q3 of last year worth $0.47. $0.16 is associated with lower-cost recoveries this year due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case. As you know, a lot of our transmission work is seasonal and the Q3 amount reflects a higher level of activity in the summer months. When we receive a final decision in the case next year, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1, 2015.
$0.09 relates to the timing of taxes, which were reversed to 0 by year end. $0.05 relates to regulatory and legal matters. This includes the impact of some favorable regulatory decisions in Q3 of last year as well as some legal costs incurred in Q3 of this year. Another $0.05 is associated with an increase in shares outstanding, and the impact here on the share count is magnified by the fact that earnings in Q3 last year were so much higher as a result of booking 3 quarters' worth of revenue increase to the GRC. $0.03 relates to the disposition of SolarCity stock in Q3 last year and $0.09 relates to a variety of smaller miscellaneous items, many of which are tightening. And we've had positive miscellaneous items in previous quarters. These factors are partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to growth in rate base earnings. That's it for our Q3 results.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 guidance. Previously, we've had a guidance range from earnings from operations of $2.90 to $3.10. Year-to-date, we've been trending towards the upper end of this range. Therefore, today, we're narrowing our range to between $3 and $3.10. There are a few other changes to this slide. We've reduced our range for pipeline-related expenses, and I'll say more about that in a moment. We've also updated our insurance recoveries just to reflect the amount we recovered in the quarter. Our resulting GAAP guidance is shown at the bottom of the table. 
On Slide 8, we've updated our 2015 CapEx assumptions from $5.5 billion previously to $5.3 billion. There are really 2 main reasons for this update. First, our response to the recent wildfires displaced some of our planned work in electric operations. And second, we're realizing some efficiencies in gas operations primarily related to our distribution pipe replacement program. The other assumptions for 2015 on this slide remain consistent with what we've previously provided.
Slide 9 reflects the updated range for pipeline-related expenses that I mentioned earlier. You can see we've decreased the upper end of that range from $150 million to $125 million. The lower end remains at $100 million. You'll recall that this item is primarily associated with our rights of way work, and we continue to expect that the cost of the overall program will not exceed $500 million. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain the same at $700 million to $800 million. Through the end of Q3, we've issued roughly $700 million of equity. This includes about $350 million through a block trade done in August, about $75 million through our continuous equity program earlier in the year and then about $275 million through our internal programs. Those are our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs. We do not expect to issue any additional equity this year other than through our internal programs.
Slide 11 shows our estimated CapEx through 2019. And other than the change to 2015 that I previously covered, the ranges for 2016 through 2019 remain the same.
Slide 12 shows our estimates of authorized rate base through 2019 and these are consistent with the CapEx ranges on the previous slide. As a result, we estimate that 6% to 8% annual growth in our authorized rate base over this period. As Tony discussed, California's clean energy policies and our focus on system safety and reliability are driving significant investment in the coming years and support this strong growth profile.
I'll stop here so that we can now open the lines for your questions."

Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged. California continues to lead the U.S. in driving clean energy policies, and PG&E will play a critical role in helping to achieve the state's goals.",1064,"Thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged. California continues to lead the U.S. in driving clean energy policies, and PG&E will play a critical role in helping to achieve the state's goals. We also know that safety must be at the core of all of our decisions, and our commitment to that is unwavering.
We continue to make progress towards resolving outstanding regulatory and legal issues while strengthening our safety and compliance programs. We believe that executing our strategies in these focus areas will provide the foundation for both operational and financial success. So I want to touch on some of the key developments this quarter before I turn it over to Kent to discuss our financial results. Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos are also with us today, and they'll be available to take any questions that you have. In terms of our focus on clean energy.  PG&E has a long history of action on climate change, and we've been a vocal advocate for policies that will move it forward. In fact, I recently participated in a meeting with President Obama to talk about the actions PG&E is taking to help drive clean energy policy and greenhouse gas reductions. We supported Governor Brown's recent move to increase the renewable energy target to 50% by 2030, and we're confident that we can get there.
We've been investing in the electric grid to enable both utility scale renewable and the growing distributed resources such as rooftop solar, electric vehicles and energy storage. During the quarter, we filed our proposal to update the current net metering rates. Our proposal supports the continued growth of rooftop solar while beginning the transition to a sustainable rate structure that also supports the necessary grid investments.
Our 2017 General Rate Case includes detailed proposal for continued grid modernization to ensure that we have the visibility and flexibility we'll need to enable all of the new distributed resources. Our General Rate Case also supports our goal on delivering customer expectations by providing customers with safe, reliable and affordable service.
Using a risk-based approach, we propose safety related investments across the system including replacing aging infrastructure, taking targeted actions to reduce risk and improving our emergency response. And we balance the necessary investments with affordability. Average residential bills will increase less than 3% and will remain below the national average.
In terms of reliability, the most significant event this quarter was fires in Northern California. As you know, California is in its fourth year of severe drought, and we've been partnering throughout the year with CAL FIRE and other stakeholders to address the challenging fire season. Our efforts have included things like increased patrols in vegetation management as well as enhanced emergency response coordination. At one point, the state was simultaneously fighting 3 major wildfires across 300,000 acres of our service territory. In addition to restoring power to impacted customers, our crews came up with creative ways to meet our communities' needs in a very challenging time. So for example, we leveraged the new explorable power technology from our electric trucks to provide an evacuation shelter with backup electricity when its generator failed. The response from our customers and other stakeholders has been positive, and we're really proud of how safely and quickly our crews were able to perform the work.
As we publicly reported, CAL FIRE is investigating whether one of our electric lines could potentially have been the source of the big fire. That investigation is still underway and could take quite a while to complete. So we don't have any updates on that at this time.
On the heels of the state's historic drought, we're now hearing forecast about an El Niño winter, which could bring significant rainfall and cause mudslides and floods. Our team has been preparing for this possibility through a wide array of actions including updating our meteorological models and performing drills that simulate potential flood scenarios.
Finally, in terms of resolving outstanding regulatory issues, we recently received a report from the Safety and Enforcement Division on the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. While the report identified a number of potential past violations, which we'll be responding to in the next month. We were pleased to see that also acknowledged the progress we've made to improve our records. Over the last 2 years, we've implemented a number of new procedures that have been informed by extensive benchmarking and industry best practices. As we said from the beginning, we know we have more work to do to enhance our distribution records and practices, and we're absolutely committed to getting that right.
Geisha and Nick recently had a chance to share some of the actions we've taken to improve our safety culture at the California Public Utilities Commission's first ever safety en banc. This was an opportunity for all 5 commissioners, the presidents of California's investor-owned utilities and a number of interveners to talk about what each of the utilities is currently doing around safety and what changes the commission might make to better incorporate safety into its proceedings. Nick and Geisha talked about the changes made by our Board of Directors to focus on safety, the strong link between our executive compensation programs and safety performance, our use of third-party experts in benchmarking and the way we engage our frontline crews around safety. The commission also had the opportunity here from other utilities and to start thinking about how to create common metrics to track and measure progress. I can tell you that we thought it was a really positive step forward in the conversation, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all the parties.
So before I turn this over to Kent, I just want to take a moment to thank him for all that he's done for PG&E. As you know, after 33 years with the company, Kent has decided to retire next year. Kent has done a tremendous job managing PG&E's financial activities during challenges that were some of the most complex in our industry. He's also been a great source of leadership and inspiration across the company.

139813,312693538,883905,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone.

I plan to first cover our results for the quarter, and then I'll go through our updated guidance. Let me say upfront that the complexity of our rate case timing issues has made it especially difficult for you to forecast quarterly results. However, we do expect solid results for the full year, and you'll see that when I get to guidance.
So I'll start with our quarterly results, which is on Slide 5. Earnings from operations were $0.84 in the third quarter and GAAP earnings, including our items impacting comparability, were $0.63. Our pipeline-related expenses in the quarter were $32 million pretax or $19 million after-tax shown in the table. This includes our cost to remediate encroachments on our pipeline  rights-of-way and to complete the remaining expense work for our pipeline safety enhancement plan. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses in the quarter were $14 million pretax or $8 million after-tax in the table, and here we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications.
Fines and penalties in the quarter were $142 million pretax as shown in the table below. This amount represents the disallowed capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which were accruing as we do the work.
Finally, we received insurance recoveries in the quarter of $10 million pretax or $6 million after-tax as shown in the table above. I'm pleased that we now resolved all San Bruno claims with our insurance carriers; and in total, we recovered $515 million through insurance.
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $1.73 in Q3 last year and $0.84 in Q3 this year, and this is where it gets a little complicated due to all the timing issues. In Q3 last year, we've recorded 3 quarters’ worth of revenue increase associated with our 2014 General Rate Case. That's the biggest difference from Q3 of last year worth $0.47. $0.16 is associated with lower-cost recovery this year due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case. As you know, a lot of our transmission work is seasonal and the Q3 amount reflects a higher level of activity in the summer months. When we receive a final decision in the case next year, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1, 2015.
$0.09 relates to the timing of taxes, which reversed to 0 by year-end. $0.05 relates to regulatory and legal matters. This includes the impact of some favorable regulatory decisions in Q3 of last year as well as some legal costs incurred in Q3 of this year. Another $0.05 is associated with an increase in shares outstanding, and the impact here on share count is magnified by the fact that earnings in Q3 last year were so much higher as a result of booking 3 quarters’ worth of revenue increase to the GRC. $0.03 relates to the disposition of SolarCity stock in Q3 last year and $0.09 relates to a variety of smaller miscellaneous items, many of which are timing. And we've had positive miscellaneous items in previous quarters. These factors are partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to growth in rate base earnings. That's it for our Q3 results.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 guidance. Previously, we've had a guidance range for earnings from operations of $2.90 to $3.10. Year-to-date, we've been trending towards the upper end of this range. Therefore, today, we're narrowing our range to between $3 and $3.10. There are few other changes to this slide. We've reduced our range for pipeline-related expenses, and I'll say more about that in a moment. We've also updated our insurance recoveries just to reflect the amount we recovered in the quarter. Our resulting GAAP guidance is shown at the bottom of the table.
On Slide 8, we've updated our 2015 CapEx assumptions from $5.5 billion previously to $5.3 billion. There are really 2 main reasons for this update: First, our response to the recent wildfires displaced some of our planned work in electric operations. And second, we're realizing some efficiencies in gas operations, primarily related to our distribution pipe replacement program. The other assumptions for 2015 on this slide remain consistent with what we've previously provided.
Slide 9 reflects the updated range for pipeline-related expenses that I mentioned earlier. You can see we've decreased the upper end of that range from $150 million to $125 million. The lower end remains at $100 million. You'll recall that this item is primarily associated with our rights-of-way work, and we continue to expect that the cost of the overall program will not exceed $500 million.
Moving on to Slide 10. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain the same at $700 million to $800 million. Through the end of Q3, we've issued roughly $700 million of equity. This includes about $350 million through a block trade done in August, about $75 million through our continuous equity offering program earlier in the year and then about $275 million through our internal programs. Those are our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs. We do not expect to issue any additional equity this year other than through our internal programs.
Slide 11 shows our estimated CapEx through 2019. And other than the change to 2015 that I previously covered, the ranges for 2016 through 2019 remain the same.
Slide 12 shows our estimates of authorized rate base through 2019 and these are consistent with the CapEx ranges on the previous slide. As a result, we estimate that 6% to 8% annual growth in our authorized rate base over this period. As Tony discussed, California's clean energy policies and our focus on system safety and reliability are driving significant investment in the coming years and support this strong growth profile.
I'll stop here so that we can now open the lines for your questions."

Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged. California continues to lead the U.S. in driving clean energy policies, and PG&E will play a critical role in helping to achieve the state's goals.",1067,"Thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged. California continues to lead the U.S. in driving clean energy policies, and PG&E will play a critical role in helping to achieve the state's goals. We also know that safety must be at the core of all of our decisions, and our commitment to that is unwavering.
We continue to make progress towards resolving outstanding regulatory and legal issues while strengthening our safety and compliance programs. We believe that executing our strategies in these focus areas will provide the foundation for both operational and financial success. So I want to touch on some of the key developments this quarter before I turn it over to Kent to discuss our financial results. Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos are also with us today, and they'll be available to take any questions that you have. In terms of our focus on clean energy, PG&E has a long history of action on climate change, and we've been a vocal advocate for policies that will move it forward. In fact, I recently participated in a meeting with President Obama to talk about the actions PG&E is taking to help drive clean energy policy and greenhouse gas reductions. We supported Governor Brown's recent move to increase the renewable energy target to 50% by 2030, and we're confident that we can get there.
We've been investing in the electric grid to enable both utility scale renewable and the growing distributed resources such as rooftop solar, electric vehicles and energy storage. During the quarter, we filed our proposal to update the current net metering rates. Our proposal supports the continued growth of rooftop solar while beginning the transition to a sustainable rate structure that also supports the necessary grid investments.
Our 2017 General Rate Case includes detailed proposal for continued grid modernization to ensure that we have the visibility and flexibility we'll need to enable all of the new distributed resources. Our General Rate Case also supports our goal on delivering customer expectations by providing customers with safe, reliable and affordable service.
Using a risk-based approach, we propose safety related investments across the system including replacing aging infrastructure, taking targeted actions to reduce risk and improving our emergency response. And we balance the necessary investments with affordability. Average residential bills will increase less than 3% and will remain below the national average.
In terms of reliability, the most significant event this quarter were the fires in Northern California. As you know, California is in its fourth year of a severe drought, and we've been partnering throughout the year with CAL FIRE and other stakeholders to address the challenging fire season. Our efforts have included things like increased patrols and vegetation management, as well as enhanced emergency response coordination. At one point, the state was simultaneously fighting 3 major wildfires across 300,000 acres of our service territory. In addition to restoring power to impacted customers, our crews came up with creative ways to meet our communities' needs in a very challenging time. So for example, we leveraged the new explorable power technology from our electric trucks to provide an evacuation shelter with backup electricity when its generator failed. The response from our customers and other stakeholders has been positive, and we're really proud of how safely and quickly our crews were able to perform the work.
As we publicly reported, CAL FIRE is investigating whether one of our electric lines could potentially have been the source of the Butte fire. That investigation is still underway and could take quite a while to complete. So we don't have any updates on that at this time.
On the heels of the state's historic drought, we're now hearing forecast about an El Niño winter, which could bring significant rainfall and cause mudslides and floods. Our team has been preparing for this possibility through a wide array of actions including updating our meteorological models and performing drills that simulate potential flood scenarios.
Finally, in terms of resolving outstanding regulatory issues, we recently received a report from the Safety and Enforcement Division on the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. While the report identified a number of potential past violations, which we'll be responding to in the next month, we were pleased to see that it also acknowledged the progress we've made to improve our records. Over the last 2 years, we've implemented a number of new procedures that have been informed by extensive benchmarking and industry best practices. As we've said from the beginning, we know we have more work to do to enhance our distribution records and practices, and we're absolutely committed to getting that right.
Geisha and Nick recently had a chance to share some of the actions we've taken to improve our safety culture at the California Public Utilities Commission's first ever safety en banc. This was an opportunity for all 5 commissioners, the presidents of California's investor-owned utilities and a number of interveners to talk about what each of the utilities is currently doing around safety and what changes the commission might make to better incorporate safety into its proceedings. Nick and Geisha talked about the changes made by our Board of Directors to focus on safety, the strong link between our executive compensation programs and safety performance, our use of third-party experts in benchmarking and the way we engage our frontline crews around safety. The commission also had the opportunity here from other utilities and to start thinking about how to create common metrics to track and measure progress. I can tell you that we thought it was a really positive step forward in the conversation, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all the parties.
So before I turn this over to Kent, I just want to take a moment to thank him for all that he's done for PG&E. As you know, after 33 years with the company, Kent has decided to retire next year. Kent has done a tremendous job managing PG&E's financial activities during challenges that were some of the most complex in our industry. He's also been a great source of leadership and inspiration across the company. We're working through the succession process right now, and I'm thankful that Kent has agreed to stay on to ensure a smooth transition.
So thank you, Kent. And with that, I'll turn it over to you."

I plan to first cover our results for the quarter, and then I'll go through our updated guidance. Let me say upfront that the complexity of our rate case timing issues has made it especially difficult for you to forecast quarterly results. However, we do expect solid results for the full year, and you'll see that when I get to guidance.
So I'll start with our quarterly results, which is on Slide 5. Earnings from operations were $0.84 in the third quarter and GAAP earnings, including our items impacting comparability, were $0.63. Our pipeline-related expenses in the quarter were $32 million pretax or $19 million after-tax shown in the table. This includes our cost to remediate encroachments on our pipeline  rights-of-way and to complete the remaining expense work for our pipeline safety enhancement plan. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses in the quarter were $14 million pretax or $8 million after-tax in the table, and here we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications.
Fines and penalties in the quarter were $142 million pretax as shown in the table below. This amount represents the disallowed capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we're accruing as we do the work.
Finally, we received insurance recoveries in the quarter of $10 million pretax or $6 million after-tax, as shown in the table above. I'm pleased that we now resolved all San Bruno claims with our insurance carriers; and in total, we recovered $515 million through insurance.
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $1.73 in Q3 last year and $0.84 in Q3 this year, and this is where it gets a little complicated due to all the timing issues. In Q3 last year, we recorded 3 quarters’ worth of revenue increase associated with our 2014 General Rate Case. That's the biggest difference from Q3 of last year worth $0.47. $0.16 is associated with lower-cost recovery this year due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case. As you know, a lot of our transmission work is seasonal and the Q3 amount reflects a higher level of activity in the summer months. When we receive a final decision in the case next year, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1, 2015.
$0.09 relates to the timing of taxes, which reversed to 0 by year-end. $0.05 relates to regulatory and legal matters. This includes the impact of some favorable regulatory decisions in Q3 of last year as well as some legal costs incurred in Q3 of this year. Another $0.05 is associated with an increase in shares outstanding, and the impact here on share count is magnified by the fact that earnings in Q3 last year were so much higher as a result of booking 3 quarters’ worth of revenue increase to the GRC. $0.03 relates to the disposition of SolarCity stock in Q3 last year and $0.09 relates to a variety of smaller miscellaneous items, many of which are timing. And we've had positive miscellaneous items in previous quarters. These factors are partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to growth in rate base earnings. That's it for our Q3 results.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 guidance. Previously, we've had a guidance range for earnings from operations of $2.90 to $3.10. Year-to-date, we've been trending towards the upper end of this range. Therefore, today, we're narrowing our range to between $3 and $3.10. There are a few other changes to this slide. We've reduced our range for pipeline-related expenses, and I'll say more about that in a moment. We've also updated our insurance recoveries just to reflect the amount we recovered in the quarter. Our resulting GAAP guidance is shown at the bottom of the table.
On Slide 8, we've updated our 2015 CapEx assumptions from $5.5 billion previously to $5.3 billion. There are really 2 main reasons for this update. First, our response to the recent wildfires displaced some of our planned work in electric operations. And second, we're realizing some efficiencies in gas operations, primarily related to our distribution pipe replacement program. The other assumptions for 2015 on this slide remain consistent with what we've previously provided.
Slide 9 reflects the updated range for pipeline-related expenses that I mentioned earlier. You can see we've decreased the upper end of that range from $150 million to $125 million. The lower end remains at $100 million. You'll recall that this item is primarily associated with our rights-of-way work, and we continue to expect that the cost of the overall program will not exceed $500 million.
Moving on to Slide 10. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain the same at $700 million to $800 million. Through the end of Q3, we've issued roughly $700 million of equity. This includes about $350 million through a block trade done in August, about $75 million through our continuous equity offering program earlier in the year and then about $275 million through our internal programs. Those are our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs. We do not expect to issue any additional equity this year other than through our internal programs.
Slide 11 shows our estimated CapEx through 2019. And other than the change to 2015 that I previously covered, the ranges for 2016 through 2019 remain the same.
Slide 12 shows our estimates of authorized rate base through 2019 and these are consistent with the CapEx ranges on the previous slide. As a result, we estimate that 6% to 8% annual growth in our authorized rate base over this period. As Tony discussed, California's clean energy policies and our focus on system safety and reliability are driving significant investment in the coming years and support this strong growth profile.
I'll stop here so that we can now open the lines for your questions."
