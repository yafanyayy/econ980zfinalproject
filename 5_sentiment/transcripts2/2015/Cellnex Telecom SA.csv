Thank you so much for your time today and please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of Cellnex's performance for the first semester of 2015. We will start with Slide #3. We are showing here a strong top line grow",3042,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for your time today and please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of Cellnex's performance for the first semester of 2015. We will start with Slide #3. We are showing here a strong top line growth due to our telecom site rental business performance, explained by sound organic growth with an increase of 4.5% in the semester and the contribution of our recent accretive acquisitions. This activity more than offsets temporary impacts from our broadcasting business, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels from next year. We have also paved the way for further future organic growth by signing contracts with new customers such as wireless broadband operators in the telecom tegmental area, as well as new and improved terms for future renewals with existing customers.
Consider the surrounding our broadcasting business have completely disappeared as the risk of loss of 8 additional TV channels is gone now, and the retendering of capacity linked to TV channel shut down last year is on track. We have also taken the first step of our future efficiency program, details of which will be presented in the second semester results of 2015, carrying out a number of initiatives in key operating areas with very encouraging results, offering for instance paybacks of around 3 to 5 years.
Also, we keep generating cash at a strong pace, 35% increase in terms of recovering leverage free cash flow while controlling our CapEx needs is a strict criteria. We have successful in showed our inaugural bond, thus creating a stable capital structure for the long-term. At the competitive cost and removing at the same time, any covenant that could constrain our future growth. After this bond issue, our average cost of the debt stands at 2.2% on average.
And finally, in light of recent development and our view of the medium-term, we have revised upwards our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance to around EUR 235 million, ahead of the current market consensus.
If we go to Slide #4 please, business performance for the semester. During the first months of 2015, we have set the foundation for the solid organic growth with potential for EUR 15 million of additional revenues associated to increase commercial activity and new contracts signed. In the Telecom Site Rental business, we have achieved the following goals: First, 7,676 new towers acquired in the period with 300 towers acquired from Telefonica in January 2015 and 7,677 towers acquired from Wind as of March 2015. The implementation planned of these new portfolios is currently on track. Second, we have also been active, optimizing our portfolio with 10 new sites built, 75 sites decommissioned and 54 sites, which now has a dual use after serving telecom rental customers from them. Third, in terms of commercial activity, Cellnex has reached an agreement with a non-anchored tenant over a 10-year period in order to bring in the terms of its current contracts as they expire. The new tariff scheme has already been defined with potential revenues of around EUR 4 million and 700 PoPs to be renewed over 2015-2018 period.
Fourth, Cellnex has also reached an agreement with our wireless broadband operator, by which it will make use of our portfolio of towers. We have project scope of up to 1,500 PoPs and 350 PoPs that have already expected in 2015. The positive annual impact in revenues from this agreement can reach up to EUR11 million. We are also negotiating with utilities companies and public entities the possibility to take the financial heights in order to start new telecom sites on both demand and rooftop own by these entities.
And finally, we are also actively analyzing new production metallization, in other words, decommissioning projects, with multiple of the operators that are looking for operating expenditures reductions. With a potential for at least 2,000 towers in the next semesters.
Slide #5. Business performance, broadcast media services and others. And here, the main message is that we are glad to confirm that the risk of loss of 8 traditional TV channels have completely disappeared after the Supreme Court decision to definitively close the case. This loss have resulted in the negative impact of revenues of circle EUR 40 million on a full year basis.
Cellnex is also expecting the recovery of around EUR 35 million per annum coming from the retender of 1.75 national multiplexes in the service start, the 1st of January 2016. This process is well on track with 13 companies bidding for 6 TV channels. These licenses are expected to be awarded by October this year and expected to be operated by early 2016. With parts to renew through DTT contracts with national broadcasters representing EUR 20 million per year and a backlog increase of EUR 85 million euros, it is important to highlight that these renewals have been made with no change on the current average price per multiplex, and at the same time, these pricing mechanism is linked to CTI.
Our current national DTT average contract life, which is 4 years with the maximum possible is 5 years.
Finally, in the network services and others area, we have extended a public quotation and disaster relief in our contract with an associated backlog increase of EUR 9 million. We are also analyzing new projects in the area of Internet of Things.
Moving to Slide #6, cost efficiencies. We are working hard on this front and looking to present our new efficiency program during H2. Today, our first step in different operating areas are yielding excellent results, which we expect to consolidate and extend to other areas across our cost base. As examples of these actions we are undertaking, we have just started a ground lease contract program analyzing more than 200 projects, which is offering paybacks of 3.5 years. These programs consist of a mix between price renegotiation of the annual lease and that from payments in the change of these lease extensions and these reductions. We are also upgrading our radio frequency connectivity network in order to make a more efficient use of the spectrum and therefore, achieving savings and spectrum fees as well as improving the energy consumption in our sites.
Slide #7, and looking at our key performance indicators. We have increased the total number of sites during the first semester to 15,140, mainly due to our last transaction in Italy. We have also increased our tenants ratio in Spain, 5% compared to December 2014, thanks to the addition of more tenants and the decommissioning process of our own sites in order to achieve a more efficient network. Our tenancy rate in Italy decreases due to the dilution impact from the last transaction carry out in Italy. It is worth highlighting that as of June 2015, our telecom site rental activity represents 44% of our total revenues. With these are expected to reach half of our business by the end of 2015. At the full year effect of our last transaction and the focus on growing in this area both organically and in organically is reflected in our peers.
Taking to Slide #8, tenancy ratio in Telecom Site Rental. You can see here the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidated financial ratio for Cellnex, with an impact from inorganic growth explaining the main changes. Despite this affect, we have continued to optimize our network through the commissioning and managed to grow organically by adding tenants in the countries where we are present. During the period, we have increased the number of PoPs by 4.5% in just 6 months, with even PoPs on Galata towers in just 3 months of operations. I would like to say to you that we think that the company is presenting at very strong organic growth.
In the next Slide, we have separated solution from organic growth in our adjusted EBITDA for a more visual explanation, and we will be able to see these on Slide 11.
Slide #9 in the meantime, income statement. Let me now please spend some time on our income statement in detail. Looking to revenues, we have suffered the negative impact from the shutdown of lien DTT channels that took place in May 2014. However, this effect has been offset by the simulcast broadcast on the same content on 2 different frequencies carry out in the first 3 months of 2015. The stake into account that this is a one-off effect in the year.
Telecom Site Rental increased mainly due to inorganic growth. This additional contribution from all our recent transactions both in Spain and Italy. In network services and other increases when compared to last year as well.
Moving to OpEx, we have a very well contain cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase you can see on our P&L is mainly due to cost linked to our recent acquisitions, incremental costs, which are treated as pass through and also nonrecurring items as the year progressed, we expect efficiencies to become even more visible on our P&L. After adding back these nonrecurring items and noncash effects, our adjusted EBITDA reaches EUR 415 million, a strong 26% increase when compared to the same period last year.
Depreciation and amortization increases EUR 31 million, as a result of our recent acquisitions and income tax decreases as a result of the optimization measures carried out during the year.
Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 18 million, decreasing when compared to last year due to the effects on various strain that is the oneoff effects, nonrecurring items, and secondly, the current depreciation and amortization policy of the company.
On a like-for-like basis, this net profit attributable to the parent would have been EUR 34 million without these FX instead of EUR 18 million.
Finally, the increase in early money expansion CapEx is explained by the works carried out in the context of DTT, EUR 5 million, which partial translates into more revenues in the period as explained earlier.
Slide #10 shows the financial performance regarding the Telecom Site Rental revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contribute EUR 4 million on an organic growth basis. We do think that these EUR4 million represent a strong organic performance. On top of that, inorganic growth or in other words, M&A growth represent EUR 77 million of revenues.
All of these details can be or have been explained in the excel sheet that you will be able to find also in our website.
Moving to Slide 11 and talking about adjusted EBITDA. As you know, adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit from operations before depreciation and amortization and after adding back advance to customers and first-time nonrecurring items. As you can see in the graph, the adjusted EBITDA have suffered a one-off impact due to the channels shut down, but also you can see that the money activity represents EUR 29 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 semester, and on top of that, you can see that for organic growth perspective, the company has been able to generate EUR 4 million of more EBITDA. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA 2015 first semester accounts for EUR 115 [ph] million.
In the next slide, we will be able to assess the adjusted EBITDA margin. As you know, as of June 2014, our EBITDA margin accounted for 43%. And on a like-for-like basis, we found M&A impacts and we have one-off impacts on broadcast. You can see that our adjusted EBITDA margin as of June 2015 is 44%. That is 1% margin increase over existing tower base as of 2014. In the future, our strong operating leverage. As a result of the impacts in Spain, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the first semester 2015 is diluted to 40%. We expect that once the one-off impacts from broadcast disappears, and also we include our performance on Galata, our adjusted EBITDA margin will increase in the next semesters.
Moving now to Slide 13 and talking about the recurring levered free cash flow. It is important to note that the strong growth in adjusted EBITDA is represents 26% increase, and even stronger in recurring levered free cash flow with a 36 increase. Additionally, we have managed to keep our sound cash conversion ratio of 98% in terms of recurring operating free cash flow and 89% [ph] in terms of recurring levered free cash flow, even with temporary negative impact from our broadcasting unit. Our working capital change remains very low and cash tax decreases, which is already mentioned focused impact optimization. Internal CapEx has been very low during the first semester. The attrition is expected to reverse in the second half of the year to normalized levels.
Finally, M&A CapEx increases due to our last transactions, Galata and the Phase II of Volta.
Regarding our shareholding -- shareholder remuneration, and as you can read in this slide, it is our current intention to pay out our first dividend during the fourth -- in the last part of the year, corresponding to at least 20% of our recurring levered free cash flow from our results for the second half of the year. Please also note that this has to be commensurate also with our leverage profile, our growth strategy and our net profit attributable to the parent.
Next slide, moving to our balance sheet. Cellnex is increasing the size of its total assets by approximately EUR 4 billion due to the impact of Galata and the acquisitions. And as you can see also here, our growth yield is only increasing by EUR 71 million, following our very prudent purchase price allocation strategy. Our total equity has remained similar to 2014, and the change is mainly due to the net profit. Moreover, we have increased our total borrowings by EUR 777 million in order to accomplish our acquisitions. As of June 2015, our leverage ratio was in line with our long-term leverage target of 4x net debt-to-EBITDA.
In Slide 15 [ph], financial performance. As you know, the 20th of July, we successfully completed our inaugural debt capital market transactions, with a EUR 600 million bond with a 7-year maturity and coupon of 3.12%. The bond was 6x oversubscribed in a very challenging market conditions. We have managed to carry out these transactions in this market volatility, and we think that at the same time achieving an excellent result. Our capital structure, as you can see in Slide 16, have changed significantly, and we have managed to extend our maturities at a competitive price, remove all of our covenants. Also, we have not only removed covenants, but also guarantees. We have also partially hedged our interest rates, and at the same time, diversified our source of funding. This creates the right platform to execute M&A projects, which are analyzed under strict value creation criteria we value to maximize the current free cash flow per share while maximizing the potential for capital increases.
Slide 17, M&A activity update, just a quick look now to work we sent report with our last transactions in Italy. Yes, 4 months ago, we have managed to acquire an hour rate 3,000 towers per annum in the last 4 years. As an update on Galata, the entity is performing as per our projections with unexpected full year EBITDA of EUR 62 million, which implies acquisition multiple of 12.4x in terms of enterprise value EBITDA. As you can see in this Slide, we commit at the time of IPO, we have very clean EBITDA performance regarding Galata, and we are already delivering the result to the market to our shareholders.
As you know, we keep extremely active analyzing the money opportunities in order to make the most for the European tower outsourcing opportunity as a way to maximize value creation for our shareholders.
Financial outlook, next slide, guidance for full year 2015 in terms of adjusted EBITDA. As you can see, we are changing our guidance for 2015, and let me explain to you how we are able to handle EUR 35 [ph] million of adjusted EBITDA for full year 2015.
It's very important to explain that there are partial effects that need to be understood in order to perfectly project our performance. First, these first semester includes unreported activities, 3 months of simulcast, which is a one-offs, 3 months only of Galata and 5 months only of Phase 2 of project Volta. During the second half, we will see 6 months of both Phase 2 of Volta extended and also Galata. These, coupled with further cost retention will leave our full year adjusted EBITDA for 2015 at around EUR 235 million, above the current market consensus. In order to project 2016, we expect to recover around EUR 35 million of revenues linked to the retendering of TV, simulcast contribution in 2015 as we remove and the contribution of 3 additional months of Galata and 1 additional month of Volta extended Phase 2 in credit.
Next slide, Slide 19. As a reminder, some additional items to be considered when assessing our full year 2015 results. We not only expect our adjusted EBITDA to reach around EUR235 million, but also our maintenance CapEx to represent circa 3.5% of total revenues. Our working capital change should tend to neutral, and both interests paid and tax paid for the second semester should be similar to the amounts paid in the first semester. And finally, Slide 20, just a reminder, Cellnex made highlights over the first semester 2015 [ph]. First, we have managed to show a strong performance in the Telecom Site Rental business based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions. Second, surrounding our broadcasting business have completely disappeared. Third, we have taken the first step of our future efficiency program with encouraging results as of today. Fourth, we keep generating cash with a strict controlling our CapEx. Five, we have successfully issued our [indiscernible] created a stable capital structure for the long-term at a competitive cost, we filed covenants. And finally, and as a result of a good performance, we have revised our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance to circa EUR 235 million.
And with this, I would like to open the line for answer your questions."

You are right when you say that the first semester of 2016 have shown a very strong organic growth. Hopefully, hopefully, we are working to sustain this organic growth in the next semesters, but it's something that we cannot right now share to you. What we can tell you is that the company is fully, fully focused on organic growth and is trying to reach several agreements with different clients. And hopefully, we will be able to present to you some good results also in the next semesters. Regarding the second question, you talk about Telefonica in Germany. Let me tell you that Cellnex is focused on whole year, and there our some potential transactions that are visible and other that are not visible, and we are paying attention to all of them. And these non-visible potential transactions are not only focused on Spain, but also in other European countries. So again, the company is also working in this regard. And as you know, M&A in this field takes time, requires scouting, requires explaining very well to different stakeholders what the value of Cellnex can bring to the table. This takes time. But however, as you have been able to see our traffic, we commit and I'm pretty sure that we will be able to execute some transactions, maybe not all of them very visible right now. And also, let me remind you that perhaps it's very important to meet our investment criteria where goes. So it's not only a question of having a clear target, it's a question of meeting equity here of value creation for our shareholders, and at the same time, the visibility for our bondholders.
And finally, the third question was regarding broadcasting. As commented before, the deadline defined by the Spanish government as of April 2015. In time, the growth is on track. It's very difficult for me to tell you that we will have 1.75 multiplexes working from January 1 or December 1, 2015 or from February 1, 2016. It is extremely difficult. What I can tell you is that the company is fully prepared to bring back these revenues as soon as possible. And so far, this process is working very well."

As you say, yes, Fernando, the companies performing well as regards our clients and making the investments and are working well. But let me remind you a very important theme, Fernando. In terms of organic growth, the company not only depends on the deployment policy of the networks, but also on the decommissioning or rationalization propositions that we're working on. In the Slide #4, Fernando, we are raising a very important point. We are suggesting that currently, the company is working with several opportunities in both Spain and Italy that represent a potential of 2,000 towers to be decommissioned or rationalized in the next semesters. So I think that Cellnex is well prepared not only to benefit from M&A deployment full year deployment, but also from the rationalization or dismantling projects that we are working on. And your first question, Fernando, was in terms of the second term of the year. So I understand your question was from March to June 2015. I will say to you that this business is quite lumpy, okay? It is not a steady growth. When we talk to our clients, we take time until we are able to close some organic growth transactions, but this is quite lumpy. So for instance, you can have some terms in which you increase growth more than others. But however, talking about this semester of 2015, talking about this 4.5% of organic growth, I think that in the next terms of the result is sustainable."

But what sort of timeframe are we talking about? Are you talking about semester or semesters? And could you give us a sort of flavor in terms of what sort of the decommissioned cost would you bear for that and the sort of payback for these projects? The second question is related to the framework agreements. That's done with a bit of granularity. The first one is the on hand curtailment renewal, there is a EUR4 million of additional in revenues, so I assume that the rent has increased. And I was wondering if it's just because of recovery inflation, the increase due to more service provided or other factors? And the third is the wireless growth that we mentioned here. Is that a wireless operator or is it basically a different financial operator?"

First question, you were talking about the normal operators, and the answer is, yes, okay? The answer is yes to your question. I will say to you that in terms of the timing, I am clearly semesters, so its several semesters. And this is a long-term work. We are working with different angles, and it takes time, so I think that this semester, the current semester maybe we'll see something that for sure, the first semester of 2016, we should be able to see another, let's say, effort and another step up. But when you talk about the costs and the payback, it's the same for what we share with you at the time of the IPO. Our dismantling costs is around EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per site dismantle. And the payback, when you ask about the paybacks, this is something that is quite -- we would like to be very prudent regarding paybacks, but let me suggest to you that is not currently a question of payback, it's a question of payback in relation with the underlying concept with the timing of underlying contracts. So payback can be very short if the underlying contract is short, but payback can be more if the underlying contract is longer. So it's something that we're presenting to you the results of these rationalization projects, we would like to present to you both outcomes to make comparable the effects.
This was regarding the third question. Your second question was about in framework agreements. The reason on the line, I don't know if everyone could put it to mute? Okay, thank you. Regarding the framework agreements, you are right. In the non-anchor tenant renewal, it's has increasingly a very clear tariff scheme, a new tariff scheme, which implies more tariff. So while there are several reasons, at the end of the day, obviously, what I can tell you is that these new tariff scheme or the previous tariff scheme was not optimized, and these new tariff schemes is now fully optimized, and this is available to Cellnex delivering value not only to clients, but also to shareholders in the long-term. As we have explained before, and this is an industrial company, a mutual carrier, independent carrier, which allow us to give [indiscernible] to our customers and therefore, creating value to our shareholders. And this kind of one is can only be reached between an independent company and revenues. Your third question was about the wireless broadband operators, I would like to tell you that this is not new. In fact, this is [indiscernible] and we are trying to be very prudent and very [indiscernible] we have to shared to the market at the same time not to disclose many things that we shouldn't disclose, okay?"

So an article i think on Bloomberg, a week ago, saying that from simple comps and are closer to completing a deal in Italy, and that the management could come over the next couple of weeks. Could you say what opportunities you feel this deal could presenting in terms of perhaps buying towers off the TowerCo or maybe winning secondary tenants as some towers are decommissioned by the Italian, assuming that deal does go ahead? And then an Italian holdco pretty would be interested in bidding for towers or bidding for opportunities, and what advantage you think you might have over in that scenario? That's my first question. And then the second question, a little bit easier on expansion CapEx, but where do you see your focus here in the first couple of years? Is it really a decommissioning as you're suggesting today? Or is it also built to see the NAV Internet of Things as well?"

Yes, I think that our focus in the next semesters regarding expansion CapEx will be decommissioned. It is a key point for us. It is a key point. There is already the build to suit, and also Internet of Things, because we -- you can find this in the full year term additional information [indiscernible] out of Spain. We have a company that diversified from a legal perspective, we're working. We're working in the next generation of technology, which is Internet of Things, which is of course, there will be some expansion CapEx. But the box, main bulk of the volume will come from the commissioning, as you were saying and we are presenting light of these results.
Now talking about the first question and your first question have 2 parts. First part is the impact of potential mergers among these 2 Italian PoPs. So I would suggest to all of you to go to Slide #25 of the presentation that is called European consolidation. And what you can read here is a very clear message that obviously, these potential out years have some challenges for us, but also opportunities, and we, as you can imagine when we started Galata, Volta, we are fully aware of these potential mergers between and wind in Italy, and obviously, we are fully prepared for not only respecting our current value from these contracts, but also obtaining new value from the merger. And these, for us is crucial. This is a positive challenge for Cellnex. Let me recall that our contracts are fully protected against any merger. This is the first main contract. And second, we do think that Cellnex is very well-positioned to design an optimal network to acquire new Magnum assets, provide further services, and also to carry out very important role in the merger potential synergies that arise. So when speaking to M&A transactions, we try to position ourselves not only fully protect from that value perspective with a dealer that we're working on, but also we try to be well-positioned to be capture more value. We are suggesting you towers, you're right. But also backhauling our services or other things that are explained in Slide #25. So yes, as you can see, fully prepared for this new scenario that we are welcoming and that will lead us, I think more opportunities to show for the market that a new carrier or independent carrier at Cellnex can provide value to the shareholders in very different scenarios that initially could be [indiscernible]. So this is a step we were expecting for. And that happens, we are fully prepared. And this is also talking about in wind and as I said before, other opportunities throughout Europe are part of our potential M&A activity, but I can tell you that the company is fully involved in several potential transactions in northern Europe also, in, I would say to you, other southern countries and not only in Italy, not only in win. So it's very important to remind to the call that Cellnex has a very clear M&A Golden rules, and we have to comment with all to these golden rules."

Please allow me to start by highlighting that we are proud to present again a solid set of results with all projects and work streams on track and we proceeding exactly as planned. And our current activities a continued strong organic growth with sustained demand scene for our portfolio of towers. In Slide 3, in general terms, we are showing a continued strong top line growth due to our telecom site rental business. This is explained by a sound organic growth during the first 9 months of 2015. Along with the contribution to our figures from our recent acquisition. The most relevant 1 being Galata. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of BOPs by 6% compared to December 2014. It is not regarded as 1 and even given the summer period, which is not regarded as one of the most active one in terms of commercial activity. We are also paving the way for future organic growth by actively pushing organization projects with mobile operators looking for a reduction of their cost base. In this item, we see our project scope of at least 2,000 towers to be demission and we expect to announce the good news in agreements in the next weeks. Additionally, we are also actively in trying to reach agreement with new tenants and we expect to sign new contracts with regional operators in the short-term. With preliminary negotiations signaling our scope of 700 of BOPs over the coming months. We continue to be active optimizing our portfolio with a tower decommission in process associated with a project showing a 95% completion degree. Let me recall you the project consists or consisted on the acquisition of towers from both Telefonica and. This is the performance of our telecom side rental business more than offsets the temporary impact from the shutdown of TV channels back in 2014, April, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels for next year. As of this time surrounding this business continued to be removed. With regard to this topic, we can confirm that the of this of new TV channels is on track. With the Spanish government having awarded 6 new channels and just 1 week ago. We expect to recover around EUR 35 million per annum on a full-year basis and these new TV channels to be operated from Q1 2015. Additionally, we have also seen an incremental activity in the value broadcast segment with 57 new radio stations in service during Q3 in 2015. In the network service, and other we we are also seeing another performance of revenues first to the DTT business. With new sales to regional governments of represented EUR 4 million in additional revenues for this year. Also the Spanish government have opened a bending process for its Smart Cities in different cities of Spain. With the total market opportunity of around EUR 40 million, our potential revenues for Cellnex of around EUR 15 million in the next 2 years. On top of what we have already achieved and the opportunities ahead, we keep analyzing any single opportunity we can find to create value for our shareholders. Always following our strict criteria in terms of value creation and cash flow visibility. Another example is our efficiency program with its definition and is on track on which will be offered in our 2015 full-year results presentation. Additionally, we are implementing new measures in order to restructure our tax management and a description can be found in the appendix of this presentation. We are basically in the process of implementing 3 different measures. The first one is the notion interested action, which is a tax incentive that can be found in some European countries aiming at equalizing the tax treatment of debt and equity. The second one is the capitalization reserve, aiming to strengthen net equity in the balance sheet by keeping retained earnings undistributed. And the last one is the patent box, which provides relief of from corporate tax of income generated from certain types of qualifying intellectual property. In light of our recent performance and our view of the remaining months of the year, we are in a position to confirm our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance of around EUR 235 million. Finally, a brief update on the shareholder renumeration as we intend to submit our proposal to our next Board of Directors in late November. So I would suggest to everyone to flip the slide to Slide #4. Looking now at our key performance indicators when compared to 2014, we have increased the total number of sites to 15,127, mainly due to our Galata transaction. This figure is lower than last quarter due to our network of in other words desmantling activities in Spain. We have also increased our tenancy ratio thanks to the addition of new tenants under the commission and process of our own sites. It is worth highlighting that as of September 2015 our telecom site rental activity represents 48% of our total revenues compared to 44% last quarter and with expected to reach half of our business by the end of 2015. At the full year affect of our last transaction and our focus to keep our focus to keep growing on this area both organically and inorganically is reflected in our figures. So Slide #5, you can see the evolution of sites, BOPs and the resulting consolidated tenancy ratio with the impact of M&A activity. Despite this effect, we have continued to optimize our network through the commissioning and managed to grow organically by adding new tenants in the 2 countries where we are already present. It is very important to emphasize that during the period we have managed to increase the number of BOPs by 6% when compared to December 2014. In just many months and even considering summer period, which is not the most active in terms of commercial activity. 
Slide #6. Let me now spend some time explaining our income statement in detail. Looking to revenues, we've had several negative impact of the shutdown of 9 TV channels, which took place in May 2015 -- '14, sorry. This effect has been partially offset by the broadcast of the same content of frequencies carried out during the first months of 2015. Please take into consideration that this is a one-off effect in the year with its associated revenues not to be seen again in 2016. As I have already explained, telecom site rental revenues increased mainly due to recent acquisition and also a strong organic contribution from our past transaction both in Spain and Italy. Network services and other revenues showed a strong 10% increase due to the new sales of TV terminals an the extension of DTT contracts. 
Going now to OpEx. We've had a very well contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase shown on our P&L is mainly due to costs directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Incremental cost which are treated as reflected as revenues. And finally, nonrecurring items. As the year progresses, we expect the efficiencies to start to be more and more visible on our P&L. After our nonrecurring items and noncausal effects, our EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA reaches EUR 176 million, a strong 33% increase when compared to the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization charges increased EUR 54 million mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions and income tax decreases as a result of the tax management measures I already explain, many of which will find in the appendix. Cellnex net profit reached EUR 19 million, down when compared to last year'due s to 2 combined FX of acquisitions. This increase --  the increase nominally expensive CapEx is mainly explained by the works carried out in the context of single which also translate into more revenues in 2015. 
Slide #7. Moving to adjusted EBITDA which is as profit before operation, before depreciation and amortization and after added tax to customers and all correlations. You can see how the negative broadcasting effect performance is more than offset by the contribution for inorganic and organic growth in the telecom site rental. Please note that in the performance of our adjusted EBITDA, there is EUR 6 million of adjusted EBITDA, which are coming from organic growth due to the new BOPs and additional service from networks services and others. 
Page 8. We now focus on recurring level free cash flow. It is important to note our strong adjusted EBITDA growth will have healthily increased and also we have managed to keep our sound customer share ratio above 95% in terms of recurring operating free cash flow and above 80% in terms of recurring levered free cash flow. Even with temporary negative impacts from our broadcasting business. Our working capital chain remains very low as to our strict management and we expect to finish the year with that neutral performance. In terms of cash tax, it is important to highlight that this is a higher than P&L tax due to the unwinding of the deferred tax associated to Galata. As the amortization of intangible assets is not deductible. When compared to last year's, the decrease is basically explained by the implementation of tax management measures. Maintenance CapEx has been catching up during this quarter still shows a relatively below level on a relative basis. This recent performance is expected to replicate during the last quarter so that maintenance CapEx reaches normalized levels by the year-end. 
Finally, M&A CapEx increases due to Galata and the Phase II of broadcast EBIT carried out very early this year. On shareholder renumeration, we expect to be approved -- we expect to approve this shareholder renumeration in the next Board of Directors, late November. 
So if we move to Page 9, I'm talking about our balance sheet. Cellnex has increased the size of its total assets by an amount slightly below EUR 1 billion due to Galata. Our total equity similar to 2014, we changed mainly due to the net profit generated in the first 9 months of this year. Moreover, we have increased our total borrowings by EUR 623 million in order to accomplish the already mentioned acquisition. As of September 2015, our leverage ratio is below our long-term target of 4x net EBITDA. With our net debt increasing when compared to last quarter due to a cash generation more than offset by earnings associated with the second phase of spending thanks to Galata, our IPO cost and present bond issue one-off cost. 
Slide #10. A reminder of the different items to consider when projecting our full-year guidance. We still expect our adjusted EBITDA to reach around EUR 235 million. Maintenance CapEx should present about 3.5% of our total revenues. Our non-working capital change should neutral and both interest paid and tax paid for the second semester should be similar to the amounts paid in the first semester. 
Finally, Slide #11. Please allow me just a reminder of Cellnex's main highlights for the period. First, we managed to show a continued strong performance in the telecom side rental business based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions while setting the foundations for future organic opportunities. Second, advantage of our broadcast business are progressively being removed and expected to reach a stable base in Q1 2015. Third, we confirm our adjusted EBITDA guidance of around EUR 235 million for the full year 2015. Fourth, our efficiency definition shows positive progress. And finally, we expect to grow our first shareholder renumeration in our next Board of Directors. 
With this, I would like to open the lines to -- for the Q&A session."

I think that first of all, we are assessing not only the opportunity that you are presenting to us but also several other opportunities. And these opportunities have to meet our strict criteria in terms of value creation and also in terms of cash opportunity. So for the first part of the question was about 4x, 6x, net EBITDA after alleged transaction. What we communicated in our Oslo presentation is that our target leverage is 4x. But at the same time, we are not [indiscernible] in this 4x, which means that if this year we end up being 3.7x net debt to EBITDA for us, it's not something wrong and if we continue further at 3.5 or 3x, we are not going to execute M&A transaction to become 4x. The other way around, if somehow we execute the transaction and we get to 6x, which could be a good number for us will be critical to show the market that we delivered very quickly. First, after the transaction. Second, that our client base is more diversified and also that our backlog is higher after this transaction. So it is not only a question of multiples it is a question of credit quality in general. The company as of today is BB+ and I think the management and the Board of Directors so far see this is a good level to stay. So even though we are not pragmatic. We understand that the target of 4x in the long-term make sense and we respect this transaction. If it becomes 6x, 6.5x as long as we are back to 4x. Okay regarding the minorities, minorities is something which is not only important in Italy or is not only important in other countries apart from Spain in which we are initially -- we started as a strong player. Minorities as a concept are important everywhere. Let's recall you that in the Galata acquisition we also have a minority, which is WIND. And I think that in this case Italian flavor is necessary. But as a general context, we are talking about French, our French partner, in many French partner that makes sense. As long as it is not shareholding that weaken our profitability."

As industrial partner. If you go to a new country having a minority that respect these concept that makes sense as in the case of Galata of WIND. But in the minority, which means it does not control the company so this is something for sure we must control cash flows as we are controlling today Galata's cash flows or those cash flows coming from other partner companies. Okay. Regarding the small cells question where the Spanish government have just established its next process of around total EUR 40 million. I think this is a first very good movement for European countries and it's also one of our core markets. So we are pretty -- I mean, pretty keen on that. We are really interested in developing this opportunity because as you know we have something similar in Barcelona, in the city of Barcelona. And also this is the first step in a slow trend that cannot be [indiscernible].

It's not about only economics it's about being diverse to what is [indiscernible] in a very broad concept. Obviously, our core business is telecom site rentals, is acquiring towers, dismantling towers and fostering our organic growth 6% increase in the first 9 months, but also to keep an eye on the next business development that can happen in Spain and Europe being Cellnex -- sorry, being the small cells being the key for the future. We have to learn from this, we have to assess the different opportunities to also propose different alternatives to the different city calls and to start value by giving service. So it is applicable we're just starting that for sure we would like to somehow define we would like to somehow understand to make it more profitable in the future. So this is our process.

And then regarding number 3, your question number 3, which is about the consolidation in the European markets. You are right, I mean, our somehow potential future clients and then consolidating the market, however, Fernando, taking into account what's going to happen in Denmark, which is marketing we are not present. In Denmark, it was rumored that 2 out of the 4 players in the market were going to match somehow. We were initially and it went to the European Commission and there were rumors that the remedies is that some of the was the sale of towers. That said, in order to stay, what, I mean, one of the remedies was the sale of towers. So I think that in the landscape -- or finally, you know that the European Commission did not allow this transaction to go on. So 4 players in Denmark, and the bad news is that we have not opportunity to acquire those towers or potentially have to acquire those towers. So MNO consolidation, has pros, has cons and I think the important message here for the whole market is Cellnex is really to move in a market, which has already been consolidated or has not been already consolidated. We will find angles. Towering is not only about a tower in which there are more agreements. Yes, it's all that but also about new technologies in a previous question is more about new angles regarding sale down because of a potential merger. But also new services that you can give to average consolidating market in terms of towering and maybe upgrading the last mile of the optic fiber which is next to the tower. So there may be, let's say, in fact, a business we can develop around the concept of towering which we know and we think is good. It's a dynamic concept, okay."

You said that you might see some great the reductions in OpEx in the coming quarters. Can you just quantify where those reductions will come from? If you pair up those reductions in OpEx and with the turn on of the additional broadcasting capacity in Spain, I think we've got a path maybe back towards the EBITDA margins we saw back in 2012, 2013, when I think EBITDA margins for Cellnex was around the 41%, 42%, 43% level. My second question is just on the existing business initially on the matter, just remembered at the time of IPO, obviously the high tenancy ratio in Spain, 1.8, precise tenancy ratio, lower 1.2, 1.3, just give us a little bit of your thoughts and outlook for the tenancy ratio in Italy. I think it's pretty stable since you bought the asset. Is there a pathway to get that tenancy ratio up? Having WIND as the second tenant what are your thoughts?"

As far as  we can share with you is that our performance this year will be flat in terms of compared to the previous year and we do think that in the future we will be able to share with you further assessments in this regard.
However, let me tell you that it is right when you say that in the next months as we have broadcast back we should see this EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to be back to the range you were suggesting somehow. So this is something we can't -- we cannot see in the future right now, in the next quarter's right now, we have an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%, last year we had an adjusted EBITDA margin, 42%. So yes, as soon as this business is back plus the OpEx condition plus the efficiency programs our adjusted EBITDA margin should somehow step-by-step in a planned way be improved. And also your second question is tenancy ratio in Italy. In the roadshow presentation and the IPO documentation that is available on our website, we shared with you some important regarding the potentiality of the market and so far it has not shown any growth. Again, we do think that somehow the company is prepared to increase this 1.23 tenants, tenancy ratio in the future following the same criteria we gave. You know that we have acquired let's say in order to provide clients so we tend to be very neutral here  as a neutral player. However we are working with different operators in Italy trying to reach an agreement and that will foster our organic growth. I think that -- and let me go back to your question, our focus is on organic growth. So we will do our best. This is something for sure. And this is our top top, top priority.

I'm sorry, some inorganic growth, and organic growth so this is a follow up from previous questions, you defined -- you used the long-term expression unfortunately difficult to pin down. So would Cellnex you think will go up to 6x to the right of the recession and gain it towards 4x long term. Long-term means, 1 to 2 years or even longer than that? The second thing is and I'm afraid [indiscernible] unfortunately not too versatile on your bonds. If we set up language in the bonds you issued. And the third, you talked about willingness to basically have the minorities. That would also include the lifted minorities are basically having minorities already in the market? And is this about in organic growth. Moving to organic growth, is also product question and tenancy ratio in Italy. Most of your towers, of course, WIND is already tenant. Now actions unfortunately is in the limbo for the next 12 to 18 months because of M&A. So it is likely to make any decision commission towers. We are locked in with or not willing to talk to the company to basically decommision towers or go beyond the insurance agreement there with DTT. So was the structure there? Who are the 3 main, basically, use as your target for the time being in terms of Tennessee ratio? And the third is a very good question, this quarter was impacted by one-offs that were unpredictable where payments already agreed with Telefónica over the bank or other banks. For the fourth quarter, do we expect any of these payments? Or should we see the quarter clear from that debt?"

Of time you'll come as we said before shareholder renumeration if approved by the Board of Directors. Okay. This is only one off, you will be very happy. This is not -- so the other question you raised about the organic growth is in Italy. It is the limbo question. I think this [indiscernible] question. Well, you're right, some of the players are Galata, many of the players seems to be with our company, however these are not the only customers we can have talking about organic growth. There are other players. There are other players. There are for instance, other companies, that would be interested in deploying its network. Also you'd know that these companies, you said, we all of them have obligations to spread the 4G technology. So meaning that even though dismantling towers it is what is happening at different another tower to deploy their equipment. That is an inequality are in the process of managing or pure organic performance. Maybe they're not in the limbo for the state -- they might not be in the limbo for making big decisions but not on a normal portion of the business. So our approach in Italy goes in this direction, it's obviously, not only do we be focus on MNOs we will focus on what we feel in the market which is continuous [indiscernible] some of our clients we think we can reach good, very good investment. And also on top of that, we keep on talking with different players with these MNOs in order to look for angles even with our current main client in Italy to look for new angles regarding the running growth. We can be very helpful for them in turn for instance of upgrading some part of assets next to the towers. So it's -- I think that good part of CLX, as we said before, is that we are obviously focused on tenancy rate increase, but it's not all the organic growth of our tenancy ratio we are also aiming for organic growth. So we are focused on client needs, client needs go beyond that they are right now in the process of merger. No. So I think we have angle to do and being a neutral player I mean give us a very important point here to play with different leaders and with different angles. So step-by-step, I hope we can bring to you good performance also in both countries. You have another set of questions which were about eastern minorities, eastern minorities have been obviously [indiscernible]. When we talk about minorities we are talking of Galata wins. It's more holdings may be 10%, 6%, I don't know, but the big part of this holding must be ours and having a listed majority party is not the best for us. It would not be our best case scenario, in fact. I mean, it's something we haven't talked about that. I mean, these are majorities that are not affected I can tell you. Second, you talked about the step ups in the documentation, for sure no I mean the answer is clear. not a single step up, I mean one of the key themes in our final refinancial strategy was to have a very simple documentation, with very clear clauses, with no step ups, no covenants, no guarantees, no pledge. Listen, this is very important for your very first question. When you talk about 6x, 4x, whatever you want to talk about. What you need is the commitment of your financial impacts. There is no step up now which is in the bond documentation. There is no step up language in the bond documentation, there's no covenant. So when you tell me what is your target, maybe 6x, when you come back to 4x? We don't have an automatic view on this, but we can tell you is that obviously if we 3.7x right now and we'd have to be 6x because of transformation transaction and to avoid increase in capital. We will do it obviously as long as it's commensurate with our bonds on this point of view. One of the key criteria in order to make an M&A efficient at Cellnex is not only [indiscernible] as we said turnaround leverage free cash flow per share accretive onwards but it's also the improvement of cash flow is really big. It is not the same as 6x of having to buy EUR 5 billion of backlog or being 6x and having EUR 20 billion of backlog. So all this will repent to say 6x, it depends. We will look at the backlog, we will look at the client diversification, we will look at the geographic diversification and we will look at the rate at which we delevered the company. Right now it's 0.6x net debt EBITDA this year. So after transaction we expect this increase capacity to be back to normal levers."

Thank you so much for your time today, and please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of Cellnex's performance for the first semester of 2015. We will start with Slide #3.
We are showing here a strong top line growth due to our telecom site rental business performance, explained by sound organic growth with an increase of 4.5% in the semester and the contribution of our recent accretive acquisitions. This activity more than offsets temporary impacts from our broadcasting business, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels from next year. We have also paved the way for further future organic growth by signing contracts with new customers such as wireless broadband operators in the telecom site rental area as well as new and improved terms for future renewals with existing customers.
Uncertainties surrounding our broadcasting business have completely disappeared as the risk of loss of 8  additional TV channels is gone now and the retendering of capacity linked to TV channel shut down last year is on track.
We have also taken the first step of our future efficiency program, details of which will be presented in the second semester results of 2015, carrying out a number of initiatives in key operating areas with very encouraging results, offering, for instance, paybacks of around 3 to 5 years.
Also, we keep generating cash at a strong pace, 35% increase in terms of recovering levered free cash flow while controlling our CapEx needs with a strict criteria.
We have successfully issued our inaugural bond, thus creating a stable capital structure for the long term at the competitive cost and removing, at the same time, any covenant that could constrain our future growth. After this bond issue, our average cost of the debt stands at 2.2% on average.
And finally, in light of recent development and our view of the medium term, we have revised upwards our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance to around EUR 235 million, ahead of the current market consensus.
If we go to Slide #4, please, business performance, telecom site rental. During the first months of 2015, we have set the foundations for the solid organic growth with potential for EUR 15 million of additional revenues associated to increase commercial activity and new contracts signed. In the telecom site rental business, we have achieved the following goals: first, 7,677 new towers acquired in the period, with 300 towers acquired from Telefonica in January 2015 and 7,377 towers acquired from Wind as of March 2015. The integration plan of these new portfolios is currently on track.
Second, we have also been active optimizing our portfolio with 10 new sites built, 75 sites decommissioned and 54 sites which now has a dual use after serving telecom rental customers from them.
Third, in terms of commercial activity, Cellnex has reached an agreement with a non-anchor tenant over a 10-year period in order to renew the terms of its current contracts as they expire. The new tariff scheme has already been defined with potential revenues of around EUR 4 million and 700 PoPs to be renewed over the 2015-2018 period.
Fourth, Cellnex has also reached an agreement with a wireless broadband operator, by which they will make use of our portfolio of towers with a project scope of up to 1,500 PoPs and 350 PoPs that have already expected in 2015. The positive annual impact in revenues from this agreement can reach up to EUR 11 million.
We are also negotiating with utilities companies and public entities the possibility to obtain preferential rights in order to start new telecom sites on both land and rooftop owned by these entities.
And finally, we are also actively analyzing new rationalization, in other words, decommissioning projects, with multiple of the operators that are looking for operating expenditures reductions with a potential for at least 2,000 towers in the next semesters.
Slide #5. Business performance, broadcast and network services and others. And here, the main message is that we are glad to confirm that the risk of loss of 8 additional TV channels have completely disappeared after the Supreme Court's decision to definitely close the case. This loss would have resulted in a negative impact of revenues of circa EUR 40 million on a full year basis.
Cellnex is also expecting the recovery of around EUR 35 million per annum coming from the retender of 1.75 national DTT multiplexes if the service start the 1st of January 2016. This process is well on track, with 13 companies bidding for 6 TV channels. These licenses are expected to be awarded by October this year and expected to be operated from early 2016.
We have also renewed 2 DTT contracts with national broadcasters, representing EUR 20 million per year and a backlog increase of EUR 85 million euros. It is important to highlight that these renewals have been made with no change on the current average price per multiplex, and at the same time, this pricing mechanism is linked to CPI.
Our current national DTT average contract life reaches 4 years when the maximum possible is 5 years.
Finally, in the network services and others area, we have extended a public protection and disaster relief network contract with an associated backlog increase of EUR 9 million. We are also analyzing new projects in the area of Internet of Things.
Moving to Slide #6, cost efficiencies. We are working hard on this front and looking to present our new efficiency program during H2. Today, our first steps in different operating areas are yielding excellent results, which we expect can consolidate and extend to other areas across our cost base. As examples of these actions we are undertaking, we have just started a ground lease contract renegotiation program analyzing more than 200 projects, which is offering paybacks of 3.5 years. These programs consist of a mix between price renegotiation of the annual lease and up front payments in a change of lease extensions and lease reductions. We are also upgrading our radio frequency connectivity network in order to make a more efficient use of the spectrum, and therefore, achieving savings in spectrum fees as well as improving the energy consumption in our sites.
Slide #7, and looking at our key performance indicators. We have increased the total number of sites during the first semester to 15,140, mainly due to our last transaction in Italy. We have also increased our tenancy ratio in Spain 5% compared to December 2014, thanks to the addition of more tenants and the decommissioning process of our own sites in order to achieve a more efficient network.
Our tenancy rate in Italy decreases due to the dilution impact from the last transaction carried out in Italy.
It is worth highlighting that as of June 2015, our telecom site rental activity represents 44% of our total revenues. With this, they are expected to reach half of our business by the end of 2015 as the full year effect of our last transaction and the focus to keep growing in this area, both organically and inorganically, is reflected in our figures.
Turning to Slide #8, tenancy ratio in telecom site rental. You can see here the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidated financial ratio for Cellnex, with an impact from inorganic growth explaining the main changes. Despite this effect, we have continued to optimize our network through decommissioning and managed to grow organically by adding tenants in the 2 countries where we are present.
During the period, we have increased the number of PoPs by 4.5% in just 6 months, with even new PoPs on Galata towers in just 3 months of operations. I would like to say to you that we think that the company is presenting a very strong organic growth.
In the next slide, we have separated contribution from organic growth in our adjusted EBITDA for a more visual explanation. I think we will be able to see these in Slide 11.
Slide #9, in the meantime, income statement. Let me now please spend some time on our income statement in detail.
Looking to revenues, we have suffered a negative impact from the shutdown of 9 DTT channels that took place in May 2014. But, however, this effect has been offset by the simulcast broadcast on the same content on 2 different frequencies carried out in the first 3 months of 2015. Please take into account that this is a one-off effect in the year.
Telecom site rental increased mainly due to inorganic growth, with additional contribution from all our recent transactions, both in Spain and Italy. And network services and other increases when compared to last year as well.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase you can see on our P&L is mainly due to cost linked to our recent acquisitions, incremental costs, which are treated as passthrough, and also nonrecurring items. As the year progress, we expect efficiencies to become even more visible on our P&L.
After adding back these nonrecurring items and noncash effects, our adjusted EBITDA reaches EUR 115 million, a strong 26% increase when compared to the same period last year.
Depreciation and amortization increases EUR 31 million as a result of our recent acquisitions and income tax decreases as a result of the optimization measures carried out during the year.
Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 18 million, decreasing when compared to last year due to the effects  I already explained, that is the one-off effects, nonrecurring items, and secondly, the current depreciation and amortization policy of the company.
On a like-for-like basis, this net profit attributable to the parent would have been EUR 34 million without these effects instead of EUR 18 million.
Finally, the increase in non-M&A expansion CapEx is explained by the works carried out in the context of DTT, EUR 5 million, which also translates into more revenues in the period, as explained earlier.
Slide #10 shows the financial performance regarding the telecom site rental revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contributes EUR 4 million on an organic growth basis. We do think that these EUR4 million represent a strong organic performance. On top of that, inorganic growth, or in other words M&A growth, represent EUR 77 million of revenues.
All these details can be or have been explained in the excel sheet that you will be able to find also in our website.
Moving to Slide 11 and talking about adjusted EBITDA. As you know, adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit from operations before depreciation and amortization and after adding back advance to customers and first-time nonrecurring items. As you can see in the graph, the adjusted EBITDA has suffered a one-off impact due to the channels shut down, but also you can see that the M&A activity represents EUR 29 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 first semester. And on top of that, you can see that from an organic growth perspective, the company has been able to generate EUR 4 million of more EBITDA. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA 2015 first semester accounts for EUR 115 million.
In the next slide, we will be able to assess the adjusted EBITDA margin. As you know, as of June 2014, our EBITDA margin accounted for 43%. And on a like-for-like basis, without M&A impacts and without one-off impacts on broadcast, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA margin as of June 2015 is 44%. That is 1% margin increase over existing tower base as of 2014. This is due to our strong operating leverage.
As a result of the impacts previously explained, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the first semester 2015 is diluted to 40%. We expect that once the one-off impacts from broadcast disappear, and also we improve our performance on Galata, our adjusted EBITDA margin will increase in the next semesters.
Moving now to Slide 13 and talking about the recurring levered free cash flow. It is important to note that our strong growth in adjusted EBITDA is -- represents 26% increase, and even stronger in recurring levered free cash flow with a 36% increase. Additionally, we have managed to keep our sound cash conversion ratio of 98% in terms of recurring operating free cash flow and 89% in terms of recurring levered free cash flow, even with temporary negative impacts from our broadcasting unit.
Our working capital change remains very low and cash tax decreases, which is, I already mentioned, focused on tax optimization.
Maintenance CapEx has been very low during the first semester, although the situation is expected to reverse in the second half of the year to normalized levels.
Finally, M&A CapEx increases due to our last transactions, Galata and the Phase 2 of Volta Extended.
Regarding our shareholding -- shareholder remuneration, and as you can read in this slide, it is our current intention to pay out our first dividend during the fourth -- in the last part of the year, corresponding to at least 20% of our recurring levered free cash flow from our results for the second half of the year. Please also note that this dividend has to be commensurate also with our leverage profile, our growth strategy and net profit attributable to the parent.
Next slide, moving to our balance sheet. Cellnex is increasing the size of its total assets by approximately EUR 1 billion due to the impact of Galata and the other acquisitions. And as you can see also here, our goodwill is only increasing by EUR 71 million, following our very prudent purchase price allocation policy.
Our total equity has remained similar to 2014, and the change is mainly due to the net profit. Moreover, we have increased our total borrowings by EUR 777 million in order to accomplish our acquisitions. As of June 2015, our leverage ratio was in line with our long-term leverage target of 4x net debt/EBITDA.
In Slide 15, financial performance. As you know, the 20th of July, we successfully completed our inaugural debt capital market transaction, with a EUR 600 million bond with a 7-year maturity and coupon of 3.12%. The bond was 6x oversubscribed in a very challenging market conditions. We have managed to carry out these transactions in this market volatility, and we think that at the same time achieving an excellent result.
Our capital structure, as you can see in Slide 16, have changed significantly, and we have managed to extend our maturities at a competitive price, remove all of our covenants. Also, we have not only removed covenants but also -- and guarantees. We have also partially hedged our interest rates, and at the same time, diversified our source of funding. This creates the right platform to execute M&A projects, which are analyzed under strict value-creation criteria with a view to maximize the current free cash flow per share while minimizing the potential for capital increases.
Slide 17, M&A activity update. Just a quick look now to our recent M&A track record. With our last transformational leased deal in Italy just 4 months ago, we have managed to acquire an average of 3,000 towers per annum in the last 4 years.
As an update on Galata, the entity is performing as per our projections with an expected full year EBITDA of EUR 62 million, which implies an acquisition multiple of 12.4x in terms of enterprise value EBITDA.
As you can see in this slide, we commit, at the time of the IPO, with a very clear EBITDA performance regarding Galata, and we are already delivering the result to the market and our shareholders.
As you know, we keep extremely active analyzing new M&A opportunities in order to make the most for the European tower outsourcing opportunity as a way to maximize value creation for our shareholders.
Financial outlook, next slide, guidance for full year 2015 in terms of adjusted EBITDA. As you can see, we are changing our guidance for 2015. And let me explain to you how we are able to reach EUR 235 million of adjusted EBITDA for full year 2015.
It's very important to explain that there are partial effects that need to be understood in order to properly project our medium-term performance. First, this first semester includes, among others, recurring activities; 3 months of simulcast, which is a one-off; 3 months only of Galata; and 5 months only of Phase 2 of project Volta Extended. During the second half, we will see 6 months of both Phase 2 of Volta Extended and also Galata. These, coupled with expected organic growth and further cost contention, will leave our full year adjusted EBITDA for 2015 at around EUR 235 million, above the current market consensus.
In order to project 2016, we expect to recover around EUR 35 million of revenues linked to the retendering of TV capacity, simulcast contribution in 2015 as we remove, and the contribution of 3 additional months of Galata and 1 additional month of Volta Extended Phase 2 must be included.
Next slide, Slide 19. As a reminder of additional items to be considered when assessing our full year 2015 results. We not only expect our adjusted EBITDA to reach around EUR 235 million, but also our maintenance CapEx should represent circa 3.5% of total revenues. Our working capital change should tend to neutral, and both interest paid and tax paid for the second semester should be similar to the amounts paid in the first semester.
And finally, Slide 20, just a reminder of Cellnex main highlights of the first semester 2015. First, we have managed to show a strong performance in the telecom site rental business based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions. Second, uncertainties surrounding our broadcasting business have completely disappeared. Third, we have taken the first step of our future efficiency program with encouraging results as of today. Fourth, we keep generating cash while strict controlling our CapEx. Five, we have successfully issued our inaugural bond, creating a stable capital structure for the long term at a competitive cost without any covenant. And finally, and as a result of a good performance, we have revised our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance to circa EUR 235 million.
And with this, I would like to open the line for answer your questions."

You are right when you say that the first semester of 2016 has shown a very strong organic growth. Hopefully -- in fact, we are working to sustain this organic growth in the next semesters, but it's something that we cannot right now share to you. What we can tell you is that the company is fully, fully focused on organic growth and is trying to reach several agreements with different clients. And hopefully, we will be able to present to you some good results also in the next semesters. Regarding your second question, you talked about Inwit and you talked about Telefonica in Germany. Let me tell you that Cellnex is focused on whole Europe. And there are some potential transactions that are visible and others that are not visible, and we are paying attention to all of them. And these non-visible potential transactions are not only focused on Spain but also in other European countries. So again, the company is also working in this regard. And as you know, M&A in this field takes time, requires scouting, requires explaining very well to different stakeholders what the value of Cellnex can bring to the table. This takes time. But however, as you have been able to see our track record, we commit and deliver. And I'm pretty sure that we will be able to execute some transactions, maybe not all of them very visible right now. And also, let me remind you that, for us, it's very important to meet our investment criteria, we'll call them goals. So it's not only a question of having a clear target, it's a question of meeting the criteria of value creation for our shareholders, and at the same time, cash flow visibility for our bondholders. And finally, the third question was regarding broadcasting. As commented before, the deadlines defined by the Spanish government as of April 2015 are in time. The process is on track. It's very difficult for me to tell you that we will have 1.75 MUXs, multiplexes, working from January 1 or from December 1, 2015, or from February 1, 2016. It's extremely difficult.

As you say, yes, Fernando, the company is performing well also because our clients are making the investments and are working well also. But let me remind you a very important theme, Fernando. In terms of organic growth, the company does not only depend on the deployment policy of the 4G, of the networks, but also on the decommissioning or rationalization propositions that we are working on. In the Slide #4, Fernando, we are raising a very important point. We are suggesting that currently, the company is working with several opportunities in both Spain and Italy that represent a potential of 2,000 towers to be decommissioned or rationalized in the next semesters. So I think that Cellnex is well prepared not only to benefit from the MNOs deployment, 4G deployment, but also from the rationalization or dismantling projects that we are working on. And your first question, Fernando, was in terms of the second term of the year. So I understand your question was from March to June 2015. I will say to you that this business is quite lumpy, okay? This is not a steady growth. And when we talk to our clients, maybe it takes time until we are able to close some organic growth transactions. But this is quite lumpy. So for instance, you can have some terms in which you increase your growth more than others. But however, talking about this semester of 2015, talking about this 4.5% of organic growth, I think that in the next terms, it is relatively sustainable, okay."

Now which sort of time frame are we talking about? Do you talk about semester or semesters? And could you give us a sort of flavor in terms of what sort of decommission costs you would bear for that and the sort of payback for these projects? The second question is related to the framework agreements. Is it possible to have a bit of granularity? The first one is the non-anchor tenant renewal. There is a EUR 4 million additional in revenues, so I assume that the rent has increased. And I was wondering if it's just because of recovery inflations, the increase due to more service provided or other factors. And the third is the wireless broadband operator we mentioned here. Is that a wireless operator or is basically a different HO [ph] operator?"

First question, you were talking about the tower operators, and the answer is, yes. The answer is yes to your question. I will say to you that in terms of the timing, I am clearly suggesting semesters, so it's several semesters. And not only -- I think this is a long-term work. We are working with different angles, and it takes time. So I think that this semester, the current semester, maybe we'll see something. But for sure, the first semester of 2016, we should be able to see another, let's say, effort or another step-up. When you talk about the costs and the payback, we -- is the same for we shared with you at the time of the IPO. Our dismantling cost is around EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per site dismantled. And the payback, when you ask about the paybacks, this is something that is quite -- we would like to be very prudent regarding paybacks, but let me suggest to you that it is not currently a question of payback, it's a question of payback in relation with the underlying contract, with the timing of underlying contracts. So payback can be very short if your underlying contract is short, but payback can be more if your underlying contract is longer. So it's something that when presenting to you the results of these rationalization projects, we would like to present to you both outcomes to make comparable the effects. This was regarding your third question. Your second question was about in framework agreements. Regarding the framework agreements, you are right, the non-anchor tenant renewal is -- has increasingly a very clear tariff scheme, a new tariff scheme, which implies more tariff, okay? So while there are several reasons. At the end of the day, obviously, what I can tell you is that this new tariff scheme -- or the previous tariff scheme was not optimized, and this new tariff scheme is now fully optimized. And this is a very good example of Cellnex delivering value not only to clients but also to the shareholders in the long term. As we have explained before, and this is an industrial company, a neutral carrier, independent carrier, which allow us to give value to our customers and, therefore, creating value for our shareholders. And this [indiscernible] kind of [indiscernible] can only be reached between an independent company and revenues. Your third question was about the wireless broadband operators. I would like to tell you that this is not an MNO. In fact, this is a free company, okay. And that's all. We are trying to be very prudent and very [indiscernible] info we have to share with the market, but at the same time not to disclose many things that we shouldn't disclose, okay."

The first question is on Italian wireless consolidation. I saw an article, I think on Bloomberg, just a week ago, saying that VimpelCom and Hutch are closer to completing a deal in Italy and that an announcement could come over the next couple of weeks. Could you say what opportunities you feel this deal could present to you in terms of perhaps buying towers off the merged co., or maybe winning secondary tenants as some towers are decommissioned by the Italian merged co., assuming that deal does go ahead? And in the event that an Italian merger does happen, clearly, Inwit, I guess, would be interested in bidding for towers or bidding for opportunities. And what advantage do you think you might have over Inwit in that scenario? That's my first question. And then the second question, a little bit easier, it's on expansion CapEx. Where do you see your focus here in the next couple of years? Is it really on decommissioning, as you are suggesting today? Or is there also build to suit and maybe Internet of Things as well?"

Yes, I think that our focus in the next semesters regarding expansion CapEx will be decommissioning. This is a key point for us. This is a key point. There will be, of course, other things like build to suit, there will be also Internet of Things, because we -- you can find this in the IOM [ph], in the Forgeto [ph]. This information is very clear in Spain. We have a company that from a diversified and a legal perspective, we are working on the same -- in the next generation of technology, which is Internet of Things, which is, of course, there will be some expansion CapEx. But the bulk, main bulk of the volume will come from decommissioning, as you were suggesting, and we are presenting in the first slides of these results.  Now talking about your first question, and your first question have 2 parts. First part is the impact of potential mergers among these 2 Italian MNOs. So I would suggest to all of you to go to Slide #25 of the presentation that is called European consolidation. And what you can read here is a very clear message that, obviously, these potential mergers have some challenges for us but also opportunities. And we, as you can imagine, when we started the Galata project, we were fully aware of this potential merger between H3G and Wind in Italy. And obviously, we are fully prepared for not only respecting our current value from this contract but also obtaining new value from the merger. And this, for us, is crucial. This is a positive challenge for Cellnex. Let me recall that our contracts are fully protected against any merger. This is the first main concept. And second, we do think Cellnex is very well positioned to design an optimal network to acquire new money or assets, provide further services and also to carry out a very important, let's say, role in the merger potential synergies that may arise. So when acquiring -- when executing M&A transactions, we try to position ourselves not only fully protect from a value perspective with the deal that we are working on, but also we try to be well positioned to capture more value. You were suggesting acquiring new towers, you are right, but also backhauling services or other things that are explained in Slide #25. So yes, as you can see, fully prepared for this new scenario that we are welcoming, and that will give us, I think, more opportunities to show to the market that a neutral carrier or independent carrier at Cellnex can provide value to the shareholders in very different scenarios that initially could be regarded a challenge. So this is a step we were expecting for. If it happens, we are fully prepared. And then you were also talking about Inwit. And as I said before, other opportunities throughout Europe are part of our potential M&A activity. But I can tell you that the company is fully involved in several potential transactions in Northern Europe also, in, I would say to you, other southern countries and not only in Italy, not only in Inwit. So it's very important to remind, to recall, that Cellnex has a very clear M&A golden rules, and we have to commit with all these golden rules."

Good afternoon. Thank you so much for your time today. Please allow me to start by highlighting that we are proud to present again a solid set of results with all projects and work streams on track and progressing exactly as planned, and our current activities delivering a continued strong organic growth with sustained demand seen for our portfolio of towers.
So in the Slide 3, in general terms, we are showing a continued strong top line growth due to our Telecom Site Rental business. This is explained by a sound organic growth during the first 9 months of 2015, along with the contribution to our figures from our recent acquisition, the most relevant one being Galata. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 6% compared to December 2014. It is not regarded as one and even during the summer period, which is not regarded as one of the most active one in terms of commercial activity. We're also paving the way for future organic growth by actively pushing rationalization projects with mobile operators looking for a reduction of their cost base.
In this slide, we see our project scope of at least 2,000 towers to be decommissioned, and we expect to announce good news in [indiscernible] in the next weeks. Additionally, we are also active trying to reach agreement with new tenants, and we expect to sign new contracts with regional operators in the short term. With preliminary negotiations signaling our scope of 700 of PoPs over the coming months. We continue to be active optimizing our portfolio with a tower decommission in process associated with the Volta project, showing a 95% completion degree. Let me recall you that Volta project consists -- or consisted on the acquisition of towers from both Telefónica and Yoigo. This is the performance of our Telecom Site Rental business, more than offsets the temporary impact from the shutdown of TV channels back in 2014, April, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels for next years as uncertainties surrounding this business continued to be removed.
With regard to this topic, we can confirm that the rentendering process of new TV channels is on track, with the Spanish government having awarded 6 new channels and just 1 week ago. We expect to recover around EUR 35 million per annum on a full-year basis, and these new TV channels to be operated from Q1 2016. Additionally, we have also seen an incremental activity in the Radio Broadcast segment with 57 new radio stations in service during Q3 2015.
In the network services and others area, we have also seen a strong performance of revenues, thanks to the PPDR business, with new sales to regional governments of Tetra terminals representing EUR 4 million in additional revenues for this year.
Also, the Spanish government has opened a binding process for the Smart Cities in different cities of Spain. With the total market opportunity of around EUR 40 million and potential revenues for Cellnex of around EUR 15 million in the next 2 years.
On top of what we have already achieved and the opportunities ahead, we keep analyzing any single opportunity we can find to create value for our shareholders, always following our strict criteria in terms of value creation and cash flow visibility.
Another example is our efficiency program with its definition is on track and details of which will be offered in our 2015 full-year results presentation. Additionally, we are implementing new measures in order to reshuffle our tax management. An illustration can be found in the appendix of this presentation.
We are basically in the process of implementing 3 different measures. The first one is the notion interested deduction, which is a tax incentive that can be found in some European countries, aiming at equalizing the tax treatment of debt and equity. The second one is the capitalization reserve, aiming to strengthen net equity in the balance sheet by keeping retained earnings undistributed. And the last one is the patent box, which provides relief from corporate tax on income generated from certain types of qualifying intellectual property.
In light of our recent performance and our view of the remaining months of the year, we are in a position to confirm our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance of around EUR 235 million.
Finally, a brief update on the shareholder remuneration, as we intend to submit our proposal to our next Board of Directors in late November.
So I would suggest, everyone, to flip the slide, so Slide #4. Looking now at our key performance indicators when compared to 2014. We have increased the total number of sites to 15,127, mainly due to our Galata transaction. This figure is lower than last quarter due to our network optimization, in other words dismantling activities in Spain.
We have also increased our tenancy ratio, thanks to the addition of new tenants under the commissioning process of our own sites. It is worth highlighting that as of September 2015, our telecom site rental activity already represents 48% of our total revenues, up from 44% last quarter, and with the share expected to reach half of our business by the end of 2015. The full year effect of our last transaction and our focus to keep growing on this area, both organically and inorganically, is reflected in our figures.
So Slide #5. You can see the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with the impact of M&A activity. Despite this effect, we have continued to optimize our network through the commissioning, and managed to grow organically by adding new tenants in the 2 countries where we're already present. It is very important to emphasize that, during the period, we have managed to increase the number PoPs by 6% when compared to December 2014, in just many months, and even considering summer period, which is not the most active in terms of commercial activity.
Slide #6. Let me now spend some time explaining our income statement in detail. Looking to revenues, we have suffered the negative impact of a shutdown of 9 TV channels, which took place in May 2015 -- '14, sorry. This effect has partially been offset by the simulcast broadcast of the same content over 2 different frequencies carried out during the first months of 2015. Please take into consideration that this is a one-off effect in the year, with its associated revenues not to be seen again in 2016.
As I have already explained, Telecom Site Rental revenues increased mainly due to recent acquisition and also a strong organic contribution from our past transaction, both in Spain and Italy. Network services and other revenues saw a strong 10% increase due to the new sales of Tetra terminals and extension of PPDR contracts.
Moving now to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase shown on our P&L is mainly due to costs directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Incremental cost, which are treated as pass-through, before also reflected as revenues.
And finally, nonrecurring items. As the year progresses, we expect efficiencies to start being more and more visible on our P&L. After I remark nonrecurring items and noncash effects, our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA reaches EUR 176 million, a strong 33% increase when compared to the same period last year.
Depreciation and amortization charges increased EUR 54 million, mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions, and income tax decreases as a result of the tax management measures I already explain, detail of which you will find in the appendix.
Cellnex net profit reached EUR 19 million, down when compared to last year's, due to 2 combined contribution of the FX, as I've explained. This increase is non -- the increase in non-M&A expansion CapEx is mainly explained by the works carried out in the context of the simulcast, which also translate into more revenues in 2015.
Slide #7. Moving to adjusted EBITDA which is calculated as profit before operation, before depreciation and amortization, and after adding back advances to customers and recurrent items. You can see how the negative broadcasting impacted the performance is more than offset by the contribution for inorganic and organic growth in the Telecom Site Rental. Please note that in the performance of our adjusted EBITDA, there is EUR 6 million of adjusted EBITDA, which are coming from organic growth due to the new PoPs and additional service from networks services and others.
Page 8. We now focus on recurring levered free cash flow, it is important to note our strong adjusted EBITDA growth with a 33% increase. And also, we have managed to keep our sound customer cash-conversion ratio above 95% in terms of recurring operating free cash flow and above 80% in terms of recurring levered free cash flow, even with temporary negative impacts from our broadcasting business. Our working capital change remains very low, thanks to our strict management, and we expect to finish the year with a neutral performance.
In terms of cash tax, it is important to highlight that this is higher than P&L tax due to the unwinding of the deferred tax associated to Galata, as the amortization of intangible assets is not deductible. When compared to last year, the decrease is basically explained by the implementation of tax management measures.
Maintenance CapEx has been catching up during this quarter, but still shows a relatively low level on a cumulative basis. This recent performance is expected to replicate during the last quarter, so that maintenance CapEx reaches normalized levels by year-end.
Finally, M&A CapEx increased due to Galata, and the Phase 2 of Volta Extended carried out very early this year. On shareholder remuneration, we expect to be approved -- we expect to approve the shareholder remuneration in the next Board of Directors, late November.
So if we move to Page 9, and talking about our balance sheet. Cellnex has increased the size of its total assets by an amount slightly below EUR 1 billion due to Galata. Our total equity has remained similar to 2014, with the change mainly due to the net profit generated in the first 9 months of this year. Moreover, we have increased our total borrowings by EUR 623 million in order to accomplish the already mentioned acquisition.
As of September 2015, our leverage ratio is below our long-term target of 4x debt-to-EBITDA, with our net debt increasing when compared to last quarter due to a cash generation [indiscernible] being more than offset by payments associated with the second phase of Volta Extended spending, fees liked to Galata, our IPO cost and present bond issue one-off cost.
Slide #10. As a reminder of the different items that need to be considered when projecting our full-year 2015 figures, we still expect our adjusted EBITDA to reach around EUR 235 million. Maintenance CapEx should present about 3.5% of our total revenues. Our net working capital change should tend to neutral. And both interest paid and tax paid for the second semester should be similar to the amounts paid in the first semester.
Finally, Slide #11. Please allow me just a reminder of Cellnex's main highlights for the period. First, we managed to show a continued strong performance in the Telecom Site Rental business, based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions, while setting the foundations for future organic opportunities. Second, uncertainties surrounding our broadcasting business have previously been removed, expect it to reach a stable base in Q1 2016. Third, we confirm our adjusted EBITDA guidance of around EUR 235 million for the full year 2015. Fourth, our efficiency definition shows positive progress. And finally, we expect to approve our first shareholder remuneration in our next Board of Directors."

I think that, first of all, we are assessing not only the opportunity that you have presented to us, but also several other opportunities. And these opportunities have to meet our strict criteria in terms of value creation and also in terms of cash flow visibility. So you first part of the question was about 4x, 6x, net EBITDA after a large transaction. What we communicated in the roadshow presentation is that our target lever is 4x. And at the same time, we are not dogmatic in this 4x, which means that if this year we end up being 3.7x net debt to EBITDA, for us, it's not something wrong. And if we continue to have a 3.5 or 3x, we are not going to execute M&A transactions to become 4x.
On the other way around, if somehow we execute the transaction and we get to 6x, which could be a good number, for us will be critical to show the market that we delevered very quickly. First, after the transaction. Second, that our client base is more diversified and also that our backlog is higher after this transaction. So it's not only a question of multiples, it's a question of credit quality, in general. The company, as of today, is BB+. And I think the management and the Board of Directors, so far, believes it's a good level to stay. So even though we are not pragmatic. We understand that the target of 4x, in the long term, makes sense, and we will respect this target. So happy to become 6x, 6.5x as long as we are back to 4x. Okay. Regarding the minorities, minorities is something which is not only important in Italy or is not only important in other countries apart from Spain, in which we are -- initially, we started to be a Spanish player. Minorities as a concept are important everywhere. Let's recall you that in the Galata acquisition, we also have a minority, which is WIND. And I think that this -- in this case, Italian flavor is necessary. But as a general concept, if we were talking about French, a French partner, minority French partner can make sense as long as it is not a shareholding that can weaken our profitability."

So we need control over the assets, we need control over the cash flows, we need control over the investor plan, we need control over the board, we need control in the asset itself. That's for sure, as industrial partner. The thing is that from -- if you go to a new country, having a minority, that respect these concepts can make sense, as in the case of Galata and WIND. But the minorities are real minority, which means that does not control the company. So this is something. For sure, we must control cash flows as we are controlling today Galata's cash flows, all those cash flows coming from our Spanish companies. Okay. Regarding the small cells question, well, this -- the Spanish government have just published this next process of around total bundle of EUR 40 million. I think this is a, first, very good movement for the European countries. And it's also in our -- one of our home markets. So we are pretty -- I mean, we are pretty we're keen on that. I mean, we are really interested in developing this opportunity, because, as you know, we have something similar in Barcelona, in the city of Barcelona. And also, this is a first step in a slow trend that can appear in Europe, that is the first step. So we want to be present, we want to be fully focused on that, to learn to obtain the best cash flows, to generate value for our shareholders. So this is something we are very happy.

It's not only about economics, it's about being prepared to what is towering in a very broad concept. Now obviously, our core business is telecom site rentals, is acquiring tower, dismantling towers and fostering our organic growth, 6% increase in the first 9 months. But also to keep an eye on the next business development, in the next business development that can happen in Spain and Europe, being Cellnex -- sorry, being a small cells, one of the key points in the future. We have to learn from this. We have to assess the different opportunities to also propose different alternatives to a different city halls and to extract value by giving more service. So it's a business model, which is starting that by -- for sure, we would like to somehow define, we would like to somehow understand to make it more, let's say, profitable in the future. So this is a process. Let's not forget that the small cells is related to active equipment. This is an important thing. It's active equipment, so how in both? So here, I think, in the very next -- in the very first steps of a new business development, Cellnex will be fully involved to generate cash flows that can be accretive for our shareholders.

And regarding #3, your question #3, which is about the consolidation in the European market. You are right, I mean, our somehow potential future clients and merging, and they're now consolidating the market. However, Fernando, taking into account what's going to happen in Denmark, which is a market in which we are not present. In Denmark, it was rumored that 2 out of the 4 players in the market were going to merge somehow. This was by fact -- it was not a rumor, sorry, it was for sure. And then they went to the European Commission, and it was rumored that some of their revenues, and it was rumored, is that some of their revenues was the sale of towers. That said, minority stake doesn't matter. One of the revenues was the sale of towers. So I think that, in a landscape -- well, finally, you know that the European Commission did not allow this transaction to go on, so for MNO players in Denmark. And the bad news is that we have not the opportunity to acquire those towers or potentially help acquire those towers. So MNO consolidation has pros, has cons, and I think the important message here for the whole market is clear, Cellnex is ready to move in a market which has already been consolidated or has not been already been consolidated. We will find angles. Towering is not only about a tower in which there are more equipment. Yes, it's all that, but also about new technologies that around the tower before, the previous question, the small cells. It's also about new angles regarding sell down because of a potential merger. And also, new services that you can give to the already consolidated market in terms of towering and maybe upgrading the last mile of their optic fiber, which is next to the tower. So there are many, let's say, infrastructure business we can develop around the concept of towering, which we do know and we think is good. It's a dynamic concept. Okay."

And then second question is just on the existing business in Italy on the Galata. I just remember at the time of the IPO, obviously, you had a tenancy ratio in Spain, about 1.8 tenants per site. And the tenancy ratio in Italy obviously is a lot lower at, I think, .1.2, 1.3. Can you just give us a little bit of -- just a few thoughts on the outlook for the tenancy ratio in Italy? I think it's been pretty stable since you bought the asset. Is there a pathway to getting that tenancy ratio up? Whether it is through having WIND as a secondary tenant or Hutch or another?"

The first question is regarding the OpEx and somehow you are suggesting the efficiency program. You are right. I mean, we do think that the efficiency program will present some reductions and some interesting activities for management to create value for our shareholders. As far as we can share with you is that our performance this year will be flat in terms of OpEx compared to the previous year. And we do think that, in the future, we will be able to share with you further assessments in this regard. However, let me tell you that it is right when you say that, in the next months, as we have broadcast back, we should see this EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to be back to the range you were suggesting somehow. So this is something we can obtain in the future, right now or in the next quarter. Right now, we have an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%. Last year we had an adjusted EBITDA margin, 42%. So yes, as soon as this business is back plus the OpEx contention, plus the efficiency program, our adjusted EBITDA margin should somehow, step-by-step, in a planned way, be improved. And also your second question is tenancy ratio in Italy. I think, at the roadshow presentation and also in the IPO documentation that is available in our website, we shared with you some hypotheses regarding the potentiality of the market. And so far, in terms not only organic growth, the commissioning again. We do think that, somehow, the company is prepared to increase this 1.23 tenants, a great tenancy ratio, in the future, following the same criteria we gave. You know that we are quite, let's say, shy in order to give the names of clients, so we tend to be very neutral here as a neutral player. However we are working with different operators in Italy, trying to reach an agreement, and that will foster our organic growth. I think that -- and let me go back to your question, Emmet, our focus is organic growth. So we will do our best. This is something for sure. And this is our top, top, top priority. Much more than all the rumors that can be in the press or the announcements regarding other companies. We are focused on this question you have said to us, how to improve the tenancy ratio, for instance, in Italy."

I think, in the Excel sheet, you will be able to find more details regarding the second question. But let me answer you. Regarding your first question, I mean, emerging markets for us is not, right now, the key point. I think that Cellnex, so far, should be focused on core European countries because at the end of the day, we are good at mature markets in which we can extract value through organic growth and decommissioning and efficiency. So this is our way of behaving our business model, which does not mean that, in the future, we could acquire something beyond our core markets. We cannot be closed to that, okay? But I would say, in the next year, we will be fully focused on Europe. For instance, you just mentioned some of the -- one of the former BRICS, which is Russia. I think that Russia is -- I'm afraid it's not a target market at all, I'm afraid. Because of many reasons, not because of their business model, but also because of maybe what macro economic situation, legal. So there is -- we tend to work better in countries with very strong legal frameworks, okay? And also regarding your question of the debt, in which, yes you can find in the Excel sheet and also, Juan, from IR can explain to you in detail. Let me tell you that the thing is that in this quarter -- in these 3 quarters, we'll have paid many of the one-off effects that are in our P&L. For instance, if you go to Page 6, the nonrecurring items, EUR 16 million, have been paid in this quarter. The bond issue, of course, has been paid in this quarter. On top of that, you will find in our results June -- sorry, in our annual accounts, June 2015, you will be able to see that we owe to Telefónica EUR 22 million of acquisitions of towers from previous years. So, I mean, there has been one-off payments this quarter. We are happy to have those so -- and that's all. But it's due to one-off evolution in certain areas of the business."

Kicking off on the inorganic growth, so this is a follow-up from previous questions. You defined -- you used the long-term expression that it's, unfortunately, difficult to pin down. So would Cellnex be prepared to go up to 6x for the right transaction and gear towards 4x in the long term? Recession and gain it towards 4x long term. Long term means, 1, 2 years or even longer than that? The second is, and I'm afraid because I'm an equity analyst, I'm unfortunately not very versatile on your bonds. There is any step-up language in the bonds you were issued? And the third, you talked about the willingness to basically having minorities, that would also include lifted minorities or, basically, you'll be willing to keep a notice on all this in the market? And this is basically about the inorganic growth. Moving to organic growth, and this is also another follow-up from another question about the tenancy ratio in Italy. Now most of your towers, of course, WIND is already a tenant. Now Hutchison, unfortunately, is in a limbo for the next 12 to 18 months because of M&A, so it's bit unlikely to make any decision in terms decommissioned towers. TI is locked with Inwit, while Vodafone is not very willing, at least talking to the company, to basically decommision towers or go beyond the sharing agreement there with TI. So was the structure there? Who are the 3 names that basically used would be your target for the time being to increase the tenancy ratio? And the third is a very quick question. The debt this quarter was impacted by one-offs that were unpredictable, because where payments already agreed with Telefónica or with the banks, the syndicate banks. For the fourth quarter, do we expect any of these payments or it should be a relatively clean quarter for the bad debt?"

Ottavio, as we've said before, apart from this shareholder remuneration we can leave, okay, if approved by the Board of Directors. So maybe [indiscernible], but if this is the only one-off, you will be very happy. So this is not -- so the other question you've raised about the organic growth, it's in Italy, and it is the limbo question. I take this as a last question. Well, you are right, maybe some of the players can deliver more, maybe other players seems to be with another tower company, you are right. However, these are not the only customers we can have, talking about organic growth. There are other players. There are other players. There are, for instance, WiFi companies that would be interested in deploying its network. Also, you know that these companies you said, which are MNOs, we -- all of them have obligations to spread their 4G technology. So many times, even though dismantling towers, it is what is happening at different [indiscernible] need another tower, another bidder to deploy their equipment. And it goes beyond if they are in the process of managing or not is pure organic performance. Maybe they're not in the limbo for these things, so they might be in the limbo for making big decisions but not for on a normal portion of the business. So our approach in Italy goes in this direction. It's obviously not only to be focused on MNOs. We're focused on what we feel is the broad market, which is [indiscernible] MNOs. It has also some other clients, which we think we can reach good -- favorable terms. And also on top of that, we keep on talking with different players in these MNOs in order to look for angles, even with our current main client in Italy, to look for new angles regarding the running growth. We can be very helpful for them in terms, for instance, of upgrading some part of assets next to building to the towers. So it's -- I think the good part of Cellnex is that -- Ottavio, we have talked about this before, is that we are obviously focused on tenancy rate increase, that's true, but it's not only organic growth about tenancy ratio, there are other things regarding organic growth. So we are focused on our client needs, and our client needs go beyond that if they are right now in the process of merger or not. So I think we have angle to do. And being a neutral player, Ottavio, I mean, give us a very important point here to play with different leaders and with different angles. So step-by-step, I hope we can bring to you good performance also in both countries. Ottavio, you have another set of questions, which were about listed minorities. Listed minorities, I think, obviously not. I mean, when we talk about minorities the scheme we're talking Galata and WIND. So small shareholdings, maybe 10%, 15%, I don't know, but the big part -- the vast majority, big part of the shareholding must be ours. And having a listed minority party is not -- I think is not the best for us. It won't be our best case scenario, in fact. I mean, it's something we haven't talked about that. I mean, listed minorities for us is not a target, I can tell you. Second, you talked about the step-ups in bond documentation. For sure, no. I mean, the answer is clear, not a single step-up. I mean, one of the key themes in our finance and refinancing strategy was to have a very simple documentation with very clear clauses, with no step-ups, no covenants, no guarantees, no pledge. Listen, this is very important for your very first question you did. When you talk about 6x, 5x, whatever you want to talk about, what you need is the commitment of your relationship banks. And if there is no step-up language in the bond documentation, there is no step-up languages in the banking documentation, there is no covenant. So this is very helpful. When you tell me which is your target, will it be 6x, and then you come back to 4x? Ottavio, we don't have a dogmatic on this. What we can tell you is that, obviously, if we 3.7x right now and we'd have to be 6x because of a transformational transaction and to avoid increase in capital, we will do it, obviously, as long as it's commensurate with our banks and bondholders' point of view. Ottavio, one of the key criteria in order to make an M&A decision at Cellnex is not only good IRR, as we said, low double-digit IRR, or leverage free cash flow per share, accretive from year 2, 3 onwards. It's also the improvement of of the cash flow visibility of the project. Ottavio, it's not the same being 6x and having EUR 5 billion of backlog or being 6x and having EUR 20 billion of backlog. So all these -- well, we tend to say 6x, and it depends. We will look at the backlog, we will look at the client diversification, we will look at the geographic diversification and we will look at the rate at which we delever the company. Right now it's 0.6x net debt EBITDA every year. So after a transaction, what we expect is to increase this delevered capacity of the company to be back to a normal level."

Good afternoon. Thank you so much for your time today. Please allow me to start by highlighting that we are proud to present again a solid set of results with all projects and work streams on track and progressing exactly as planned,",1974,"Thank you, Juan Jose. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for your time today. Please allow me to start by highlighting that we are proud to present again a solid set of results with all projects and work streams on track and progressing exactly as planned, and our current activities delivering a continued strong organic growth with sustained demand seen for our portfolio of towers.
So in the Slide 3, in general terms, we are showing a continued strong top line growth due to our Telecom Site Rental business. This is explained by a sound organic growth during the first 9 months of 2015, along with the contribution to our figures from our recent acquisition, the most relevant one being Galata. In terms of activity, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 6% compared to December 2014. It is not regarded as one and even during the summer period, which is not regarded as one of the most active one in terms of commercial activity. We're also paving the way for future organic growth by actively pushing rationalization projects with mobile operators looking for a reduction of their cost base.
In this [indiscernible] , we see our project scope of at least 2,000 towers to be decommissioned, and we expect to announce good news in [indiscernible] in the next weeks. Additionally, we are also active trying to reach agreement with new tenants, and we expect to sign new contracts with regional operators in the short term. With preliminary negotiations signaling our scope of 700 of PoPs over the coming months. We continue to be active optimizing our portfolio with a tower decommission process associated with the Volta project, showing a 95% completion degree. Let me recall you that Volta project consists -- or consisted on the acquisition of towers from both Telefónica and Yoigo. This is the performance of our Telecom Site Rental business, more than offsets the temporary impact from the shutdown of TV channels back in 2014, April, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels for next years as uncertainties surrounding this business continue to be removed.
With regard to this topic, we can confirm that the retendering process of new TV channels is on track, with the Spanish government having awarded 6 new channels just 1 week ago. We expect to recover around EUR 35 million per annum on a full-year basis, and these new TV channels to be operated from Q1 2016. Additionally, we have also seen an incremental activity in the Radio Broadcast segment with 57 new radio stations in service during Q3 2015.
In the network services and others area, we are also seeing a strong performance of revenues, thanks to the PPDR business, with new sales to regional governments of Tetra terminals representing EUR 4 million in additional revenues for this year.
Also, the Spanish government has opened a binding process for the Smart Cities in different cities of Spain. With a total market opportunity of around EUR 40 million and potential revenues for Cellnex of around EUR 15 million in the next 2 years.
On top of what we have already achieved and the opportunities ahead, we keep analyzing any single opportunity we can find to create value for our shareholders, always following our strict criteria in terms of value creation and cash flow visibility.
Another example is our efficiency program with its definition is on track, and details of which will be offered during our 2015 full-year results presentation. Additionally, we are implementing new measures in order to reshuffle our tax management. An illustration can be found in the appendix of this presentation.
We are basically in the process of implementing 3 different measures. The first one is the notion interest deduction, which is a tax incentive that can be found in some European countries, aiming at equalizing the tax treatment of debt and equity. The second one is the capitalization reserve, aiming to strengthen net equity in the balance sheet by keeping retained earnings undistributed. And the last one is the patent box, which provides relief from corporate tax on income generated from certain types of qualifying intellectual property.
In light of our recent performance and our view of the remaining months of the year, we are in a position to confirm our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance of around EUR 235 million.
Finally, a brief update on the shareholder remuneration, as we intend to submit our proposal to our next Board of Directors in late November.
So I would suggest, everyone, to flip the slide, so Slide #4. Looking now at our key performance indicators when compared to 2014. We have increased the total number of sites to 15,127, mainly due to our Galata transaction. This figure is lower than last quarter due to our network optimization, in other words dismantling activities in Spain.
We have also increased our tenancy ratio, thanks to the addition of new tenants and the decommissioning process of our own sites. It is worth highlighting that as of September 2015, our telecom site rental activity already represents 48% of our total revenues, up from 44% last quarter, and with the share expected to reach half of our business by the end of 2015. The full year effect of our last transaction and our focus to keep growing in this area, both organically and inorganically, is reflected in our figures.
So Slide #5. You can see the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidated tenancy ratio, with the impact of M&A activity. Despite this effect, we have continued to optimize our network through the commissioning, and managed to grow organically by adding new tenants in the 2 countries where we're already present. It is very important to emphasize that, during the period, we have managed to increase the number of PoPs by 6% when compared to December 2014, in just 9 months, and even considering summer period, which is not the most active in terms of commercial activity.
Slide #6. Let me now spend some time explaining our income statement in detail. Looking to revenues, we have suffered the negative impact of a shutdown of 9 TV channels, which took place in May 2015 -- '14, sorry. This effect has partially been offset by the simulcast, broadcast of the same content over 2 different frequencies, carried out during the first months of 2015. Please take into consideration that this is a one-off effect in the year, with its associated revenues not to be seen again in 2016.
As I have already explained, Telecom Site Rental revenues increased mainly due to recent acquisition and also a strong organic contribution from our past transactions, both in Spain and Italy. Network services and other revenues saw a strong 10% increase due to the new sales of Tetra terminals and extension of PPDR contracts.
Moving now to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase shown on our P&L is mainly due to costs directly associated with our recent acquisitions. Incremental cost, which are treated as pass-through, therefore also reflected as revenues.
And finally, nonrecurring items. As the year progresses, we expect efficiencies to start being more and more visible on our P&L. After [indiscernible]  nonrecurring items and noncash effects, our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA reaches EUR 176 million, a strong 33% increase when compared to the same period last year.
Depreciation and amortization charges increased EUR 54 million, mainly as a result of our recent acquisitions, and income tax decreases as a result of the tax management measures I already explain, detail of which you will find in the appendix.
Cellnex net profit reached EUR 19 million, down when compared to last year's, due to the combined contribution of the FX, as I've explained. This increase is non -- the increase in non-M&A expansion CapEx is mainly explained by the works carried out in the context of the simulcast, which also translate into more revenues in 2015.
Slide #7. Moving to adjusted EBITDA which is calculated as profit before operation, before depreciation and amortization, and after adding back advances to customers and recurrent items. You can see how the negative broadcasting impact to the performance is more than offset by the contribution for inorganic and organic growth in the Telecom Site Rental. Please note that in the performance of our adjusted EBITDA, there is EUR 6 million of adjusted EBITDA, which are coming from organic growth due to the new PoPs and additional service from networks services and others.
Page 8. If we now focus on recurring levered free cash flow, it is important to note our strong adjusted EBITDA growth was a 33% increase. And also, we have managed to keep our sound cash-conversion ratio above 95% in terms of recurring operating free cash flow and above 80% in terms of recurring levered free cash flow, even with temporary negative impacts from our broadcasting business. Our working capital change remains very low, thanks to our strict management, and we expect to finish the year with a neutral performance.
In terms of cash tax, it is important to highlight that this is higher than P&L tax due to the unwinding of the deferred tax associated to Galata, as the amortization of intangible assets is not deductible. When compared to last year, the decrease is basically explained by the implementation of tax management measures.
Maintenance CapEx has been catching up during this last quarter, but it still shows a relatively low level on a cumulative basis. This recent performance is expected to replicate during the last quarter, so that maintenance CapEx reaches normalized levels by year-end.
Finally, M&A CapEx increased due to Galata, and the Phase 2 of Volta Extended carried out very early this year. On shareholder remuneration, we expect to be approved -- we expect to approve the shareholder remuneration in the next Board of Directors, late November.
So if we move to Page 9, and talking about our balance sheet. Cellnex has increased the size of its total assets by an amount slightly below EUR 1 billion due to Galata. Our total equity has remained similar to 2014, with the change mainly due to the net profit generated in the first 9 months of this year. Moreover, we have increased our total borrowings by EUR 623 million in order to accomplish the already mentioned acquisition.
As of September 2015, our leverage ratio is below our long-term target of 4x debt-to-EBITDA, with our net debt increasing when compared to last quarter due to a cash generation [indiscernible] being more than offset by payments associated with the second phase of Volta Extended, fees linked to Galata, our IPO cost and present bond issue one-off cost.
Slide #10. As a reminder of the different items that need to be considered when projecting our full-year 2015 figures, we still expect our adjusted EBITDA to reach around EUR 235 million. Maintenance CapEx should present about 3.5% of our total revenues. Our net working capital change should turn to neutral. And both interest paid and tax paid for the second semester should be similar to the amounts paid in the first semester.
Finally, Slide #11. Please allow me just a reminder of Cellnex's main highlights for the period. First, we have managed to show a continued strong performance in the Telecom Site Rental business, based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions, while setting the foundations for future organic opportunities. Second, uncertainties surrounding our broadcasting business have previously been removed, expected to reach a stable base in Q1 2016. Third, we confirm our adjusted EBITDA guidance of around EUR 235 million for the full year 2015. Fourth, our efficiency [indiscernible] definition shows positive progress. And finally, we expect to approve our first shareholder remuneration in our next Board of Directors."

I think that, first of all, we are assessing not only the opportunity that you are presenting to us, but also several other opportunities. And these opportunities have to meet our strict criteria in terms of value creation and also in terms of cash flow visibility. So your first part of the question was about 4x, 6x, net EBITDA after a large transaction. What we communicated in the roadshow presentation is that our target lever is 4x. And at the same time, we are not dogmatic in this 4x, which means that if this year we end up being 3.7x net debt to EBITDA, for us, is not something wrong. And if we continue farther at 3.5 or 3x, we are not going to execute M&A transactions to become 4x.
On the other way around, if somehow we execute the transaction and we get to 6x, which could be a good number, for us will be critical to show to the market that we delevered very quickly. First, after the transaction. Second, that our client base is more diversified and also that our backlog is higher after this transaction. So it's not only a question of multiples, it's a question of credit quality, in general. The company, as of today, is BB+. And I think the management and the Board of Directors, so far, believes it's a good level to stay. So even though we are not dogmatic. We understand that the target of 4x, in the long term, makes sense, and we will respect this target. So happy to become 6x, 6.5x as long as we are back to 4x. Okay. Regarding the minorities, minorities is something which is not only important in Italy or is not only important in other countries apart from Spain, in which we are -- initially, we started to be a Spanish player. Minorities as a concept are important everywhere. Let's recall you that in the Galata acquisition, we also have a minority, which is WIND. And I think that this -- in this case, Italian flavor is necessary. But as a general concept, if we were talking about French, a French partner, minority French partner can make sense as long as it is not a shareholding that can weaken our profitability."

So we need control over the assets, we need control over the cash flows, we need control over the investor plan, we need control over the board, we need control in the asset itself. That's for sure, as industrial partner. The thing is that from -- if you go to a new country, having a minority, that respect these concepts can make sense, as in the case of Galata and WIND. But the minorities are real minority, which means that does not control the company. So this is something. For sure, we must control cash flows as we are controlling today Galata's cash flows, all those cash flows coming from our Spanish companies. Okay. Regarding the small cells question, well, this -- the Spanish government have just published this next process of around total bundle of EUR 40 million. I think this is a, first, very good movement for the European countries. And it's also in our -- one of our home markets. So we are pretty -- I mean, we are pretty keen on that. I mean, we are really interested in developing this opportunity, because, as you know, we have done something similar in Barcelona, in the city of Barcelona. And also, this is a first step in a slow trend that can appear in Europe, that is the first step. So we want to be present, we want to be fully focused on that, to learn to obtain the best cash flows, to generate value for our shareholders. So this is something we are very happy.

It's not only about economics, it's about being prepared to what is towering in a very broad concept.

But also to keep an eye on the next business development, in the next business development that can happen in Spain and Europe, being Cellnex -- sorry, being a small cells, one of the key points in the future. We have to learn from this. We have to assess the different opportunities to also propose different alternatives to a different city halls and to extract value by giving more service. So it's a business model, which is starting that by -- for sure, we would like to somehow define, we would like to somehow understand to make it more, let's say, profitable in the future. So this is a process. Let's not forget that the small cells is related to active equipment. This is an important thing. It's active equipment, so how in both?

And regarding #3, your question #3, which is about a consolidation in the European market. You are right, I mean, our somehow potential future clients are merging, and they're now consolidating the market. However, Fernando, taking into account what's going to happen in Denmark, which is a market in which we are not present. In Denmark, it was rumored that 2 out of the 4 players in the market were going to merge somehow. This was by fact -- it was not a rumor, sorry, it was for sure. And then they went to the European Commission, and it was rumored that some of their revenues, and it was rumored, is that some of their revenues was the sale of towers. That said, minority stake doesn't matter. One of the revenues was the sale of towers. So I think that, in a landscape -- well, finally, you know that the European Commission did not allow this transaction to go on, so for MNO players in Denmark. And the bad news is that we have not the opportunity to acquire those towers or potentially help acquire those towers. So MNO consolidation has pros, has cons, and I think the important message here for the whole market is clear, Cellnex is ready to move in a market which has already been consolidated or has not been already been consolidated. We will find angles. Towering is not only about a tower in which there are more equipment. Yes, it's all that, but also about new technologies that are around the tower before, the previous question, the small cells. It's also about new angles regarding sell down because of a potential merger. And also, new services that you can give to the already consolidated market in terms of towering and maybe upgrading the last mile of their optic fiber, which is next to the tower. So there are many, let's say, infrastructure business we can develop around the concept of towering, which we do now and we think is good. It's a dynamic concept. Okay."

And then my second question is just on the existing business in Italy on Galata. I just remember at the time of the IPO, obviously, you had a tenancy ratio in Spain, about 1.8 tenants per site. And the tenancy ratio in Italy obviously is a lot lower at, 1.2, 1.23. Can you just give us a little bit of -- just a few thoughts on the outlook for the tenancy ratio in Italy?

As far as we can share with you is that our performance this year will be flat in terms of OpEx compared to the previous year. And we do think that, in the future, we will be able to share with you further assessments in this regard. However, let me tell you that it is right when you say that, in the next months, as we have broadcast back, we should see this EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin to be back to the range you were suggesting somehow. So this is something we can obtain in the future, right now or in the next quarters. Right now, we have an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%. Last year we had an adjusted EBITDA margin, 42%. So yes, as soon as this business is back plus the OpEx contention, plus the efficiency program, our adjusted EBITDA margin should somehow, step-by-step, in a planned way, be improved. And also your second question is tenancy ratio in Italy. I think, at the roadshow presentation and also in the IPO documentation that is available in our website, we shared with you some hypotheses regarding the potentiality of the market. And so far, in terms not only organic growth, the commissioning again. We do think that, somehow, the company is prepared to increase this 1.23 tenants, a great tenancy ratio, in the future, following the same criteria we gave. You know that we are quite, let's say, shy in order to give the names of clients, so we tend to be very neutral here as a neutral player. However we are working with different operators in Italy, trying to reach an agreement, and that will foster our organic growth. I think that -- and let me go back to your question, Emmet, our focus is organic growth. So we will do our best. This is something for sure. And this is our top, top, top priority. Much more than all the rumors that can be in the press or the announcements regarding other companies.

This is a very big framework agreement, obviously, that's the reason we highlight it. However, be aware that we tend to reach all the agreement, which are much smaller, in the meantime. So we don't tend to tell them us maybe in this format. Let me not to say if it is in Italy or if it is in Spain, we ask to keep it as that. And also, I think it's a development in the next quarter, and you will see that, as a result of this development, the tenancy ratio should increase."

I think, in the Excel sheet, you will be able to find more details regarding the second question. But let me answer you. Regarding your first question, I mean, emerging markets for us is not, right now, the key point. I think that Cellnex, so far, should be focused on core European countries because at the end of the day, we are good at mature markets in which we can extract value through organic growth in decommissioning and efficiency. So this is our way of behaving our business model, which does not mean that, in the future, we could acquire something beyond our core markets. We cannot be closed to that, okay? But I would say, in the next year, we will be fully focused on Europe. For instance, you just mentioned some of the -- one of the former BRICS, which is Russia. I think that Russia is -- I'm afraid is not a target market at all, I'm afraid. Because of many reasons, not because of their business model, but also because of maybe what macro-economic situation, legal. So there is -- we tend to work better in countries with very strong legal frameworks, okay? And also regarding your second question of the debt, in which, yes you can find in the Excel sheet and also, Juan, from IR can explain to you in detail. Let me tell you that the thing is that in this quarter -- in these 3 quarters, we'll have paid many of the one-off effects that are in our P&L. For instance, if you go to Page 6, the nonrecurring items, EUR 16 million, have been paid in this quarter. The bond issue, of course, has been paid in this quarter. On top of that, you will find in our results June -- sorry, in our annual accounts, already [indiscernible] annual accounts, June 2015, you will be able to see that we owe to Telefónica EUR 22 million of acquisitions of towers from previous years. So, I mean, there has been one-off payments this quarter. We are happy to have those so -- and that's all. But it's due to one-off evolution in certain areas of the business."

Kicking off on the inorganic growth, so this is a follow-up from previous questions. You defined -- you used the long-term expression that it's, unfortunately, difficult to pin down. So would Cellnex be prepared to go up to 6x for the right transaction and to gear towards 4x in the long term? Recession and gain it towards 4x long term. Long term means, 1, 2 years or even longer than that? The second is, and I'm afraid because I'm an equity analyst, I'm unfortunately not very versatile on your bonds. There is any step-up language in the bonds you were issued? And the third, you talked about the willingness to basically having minorities, that would also include listed minorities or, basically, you would be willing to keep minorities on a list in the market? And this is basically about the inorganic growth. Moving to organic growth, and this is also another follow-up from another question about the tenancy ratio in Italy. Now most of your towers, of course, WIND is already a tenant. Now Hutchison, unfortunately, is in a limbo for the next 12 to 18 months because of the M&A, so it's bit unlikely to make any decision in terms of decommissioned towers. TI is locked with Inwit, while Vodafone is not very willing, at least talking to the company, to basically decommission towers or go beyond the sharing agreement there with TI. So what's the strategy there? Who are the 3 names that basically used would be your target for the time being to increase the tenancy ratio? And the third is a very quick question. The debt this quarter was impacted by one-offs that were predictable, because were payments already agreed with Telefónica or with the banks, the syndicate banks. For the fourth quarter, do we expect any of these payments or should it be a relatively clean quarter for the net debt?"

So let's just start by the very last one, because I recall it best. No, no, I think we have finished the one-off payments, okay? Ottavio, as we said before, apart from this shareholder remuneration we can leave, okay, if approved by the Board of Directors. So maybe [indiscernible], but if this is the only one-off, you will be very happy. So this is not -- so the other question you've raised about the organic growth, it's in Italy, and it is a limbo question. I take this as a last question. Well, you are right, maybe some other players can deliver more, maybe other players seems to be with another tower company, you are right. However, these are not the only customers we can have, talking about organic growth. There are other players. There are other players. There are, for instance, WiFi companies, like [indiscernible]  WiFi companies that would be interested in deploying its network. Also, you know that these companies you said, which are MNOs, we -- all of them have obligations to spread their 4G technology. So many times, even though dismantling towers, it is what is happening at different [indiscernible] need another tower, another bidder to deploy their equipment. And it goes beyond if they are in the process of managing or not is pure organic performance. Maybe they're not in the limbo for things, so they might be in the limbo for making big decisions but not for on a normal portion of the business. So our approach in Italy goes in this direction. It's obviously not only to be focused on MNOs. We focus on what we feel is the broad market, which is [indiscernible] MNOs. It has also some other clients, which we think we can reach good -- favorable terms. And also on top of that, we keep on talking with different players in these MNOs in order to look for angles, even with our current main client in Italy, to look for new angles regarding the running growth. We can be very helpful for them in terms, for instance, of upgrading some part of assets next to building to the towers. So it's -- I think the good part of Cellnex is that -- Ottavio, we have talked about this before, is that we are obviously focused on tenancy rate increase, that's true, but it's not only organic growth about tenancy ratio, there are other things regarding organic growth. So we are focused on our client needs, and our client needs go beyond that if they are right now in the process of merger or not. So I think we have angle to do. And being a neutral player, Ottavio, I mean, give us a very important point here to play with different leaders and with different angles. So step-by-step, I hope we can bring to you good performance also in both countries. Ottavio, you have another set of questions, which were about listed minorities. Listed minorities, I think, obviously not. I mean, when we talk about minorities the scheme we're talking Galata and WIND. So small shareholdings, maybe 10%, 15%, I don't know, but the big part -- the vast majority, big part of the shareholding must be ours. And having a listed minority party is not -- I think is not the best for us. It won't be our best case scenario, in fact. It won't be that. I mean, it's something we have never thought about that. I mean, listed minorities for us is not a target, I can tell you. Second, you talked about the step-ups in bond documentation. For sure, no. I mean, the answer is clear, not a single step-up. I mean, one of the key themes in our finance and refinancing strategy was to have a very simple documentation with very clear clauses, with no step-ups, no covenants, no guarantees, no pledge. Listen, this is very important for your very first question you did. When you talk about 6x, 5x, whatever you want to talk about, what you need is the commitment of your relationship banks. And if there is no step-up language in the bond documentation, there is no step-up languages in the banking documentation, there is no covenant. So this is very helpful. When you tell me which is your target, will it be 6x, and then you come back to 4x? Ottavio, we don't have a dogmatic view on this. What we can tell you is that, obviously, if we are 3.7x right now and we'd have to be 6x because of a transformational transaction and to avoid increase in capital, we will do it, obviously, as long as it's commensurate with our banks' and bondholders' point of view. Ottavio, one of the key criteria in order to make an M&A decision at Cellnex is not only good IRR, as we said, low double-digit IRR, or leverage free cash flow per share, accretive from year 2, 3 onwards. It's also the improvement of the cash flow visibility of the project. Ottavio, it's not the same being 6x and having EUR 5 billion of backlog or being 6x and having EUR 20 billion of backlog. So all these -- well, we tend to say 6x, and it depends. We will look at the backlog, we will look at the client diversification, we will look at the geographic diversification and we will look at the rate at which we delever the company. Right now it's 0.6x net debt EBITDA every year. So after a transaction, what we expect is to increase this delevered capacity of the company to be back to a normal level."

Thank you so much for your time today, and please allow me to start by highlighting the main milestones of Cellnex's performance for the first semester of 2015. We will start with Slide #3.
We are showing here a strong top line growth due to our telecom site rental business performance, explained by sound organic growth with an increase of 4.5% in the semester and the contribution of our recent accretive acquisitions. This activity more than offsets temporary impacts from our broadcasting business, which we expect to bring back to normalized levels from next year. We have also paved the way for further future organic growth by signing contracts with new customers such as wireless broadband operators in the telecom site rental area as well as new and improved terms for future renewals with existing customers.
Uncertainties surrounding our broadcasting business have completely disappeared as the risk of loss of 8 additional TV channels is gone now and the retendering of capacity linked to TV channel shut down last year is on track.
We have also taken the first step of our future efficiency program, details of which will be presented in the second semester results of 2015, carrying out a number of initiatives in key operating areas with very encouraging results, offering, for instance, paybacks of around 3 to 5 years.
Also, we keep generating cash at a strong pace, 35% increase in terms of recovering levered free cash flow while controlling our CapEx needs with a strict criteria.
We have successfully issued our inaugural bond, thus creating a stable capital structure for the long term at a competitive cost and removing, at the same time, any covenant that could constrain our future growth. After this bond issue, our average cost of the debt stands at 2.2% on average.
And finally, in light of recent development and our view of the medium term, we have revised upwards our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance to around EUR 235 million, ahead of the current market consensus.
If we go to Slide #4, please, business performance, telecom site rental. During the first months of 2015, we have set the foundations for the solid organic growth with potential for EUR 15 million of additional revenues associated to increase commercial activity and new contracts signed. In the telecom site rental business, we have achieved the following goals: first, 7,677 new towers acquired in the period, with 300 towers acquired from Telefonica in January 2015 and 7,377 towers acquired from Wind as of March 2015. The integration plan of these new portfolios is currently on track.
Second, we have also been active optimizing our portfolio with 10 new sites built, 75 sites decommissioned and 54 sites which now has a dual use after serving telecom rental customers from them.
Third, in terms of commercial activity, Cellnex has reached an agreement with a non-anchor tenant over a 10-year period in order to renew the terms of its current contracts as they expire. The new tariff scheme has already been defined with potential revenues of around EUR 4 million and 700 PoPs to be renewed over the 2015-2018 period.
Fourth, Cellnex has also reached an agreement with a wireless broadband operator, by which they will make use of our portfolio of towers with a project scope of up to 1,500 PoPs and 350 PoPs that have already expected in 2015. The positive annual impact in revenues from this agreement can reach up to EUR 11 million.
We are also negotiating with utilities companies and public entities the possibility to obtain preferential rights in order to start new telecom sites on both land and rooftop owned by these entities.
And finally, we are also actively analyzing new rationalization, in other words, decommissioning projects, with multiple of the operators that are looking for operating expenditures reductions with a potential for at least 2,000 towers in the next semesters.
Slide #5. Business performance, broadcast and network services and others. And here, the main message is that we are glad to confirm that the risk of loss of 8 additional TV channels have completely disappeared after the Supreme Court's decision to definitely close the case. This loss would have resulted in a negative impact of revenues of circa EUR 40 million on a full year basis.
Cellnex is also expecting the recovery of around EUR 35 million per annum coming from the retender of 1.75 national DTT multiplexes if the service starts the 1st of January 2016. This process is well on track, with 13 companies bidding for 6 TV channels. These licenses are expected to be awarded by October this year and expected to be operated from early 2016.
We have also renewed 2 DTT contracts with national broadcasters, representing EUR 20 million per year and a backlog increase of EUR 85 million. It is important to highlight that these renewals have been made with no change on the current average price per multiplex, and at the same time, this pricing mechanism is linked to CPI.
Our current national DTT average contract life reaches 4 years when the maximum possible is 5 years.
Finally, in the network services and others area, we have extended a public protection and disaster relief network contract with an associated backlog increase of EUR 9 million. We are also analyzing new projects in the area of Internet of Things.
Moving to Slide #6, cost efficiencies. We are working hard on this front and looking to present our new efficiency program during H2. Today, our first steps in different operating areas are yielding excellent results, which we expect can consolidate and extend to other areas across our cost base. As examples of these actions we are undertaking, we have just started a ground lease contract renegotiation program analyzing more than 200 projects, which is offering paybacks of 3.5 years. These programs consist of a mix between price renegotiation of the annual lease and upfront payments in a change of lease extensions and lease reductions. We are also upgrading our radio frequency connectivity network in order to make a more efficient use of the spectrum, and therefore, achieving savings in spectrum fees as well as improving the energy consumption in our sites.
Slide #7, and looking at our key performance indicators. We have increased the total number of sites during the first semester to 15,140, mainly due to our last transaction in Italy. We have also increased our tenancy ratio in Spain 5% compared to December 2014, thanks to the addition of more tenants and the decommissioning process of our own sites in order to achieve a more efficient network.
Our tenancy rate in Italy decreases due to the dilution impact from the last transaction carried out in Italy.
It is worth highlighting that as of June 2015, our telecom site rental activity represents 44% of our total revenues. With this, they are expected to reach half of our business by the end of 2015 as the full year effect of our last transaction and our focus to keep growing in this area, both organically and inorganically, is reflected in our figures.
Turning to Slide #8, tenancy ratio in telecom site rental. You can see here the evolution of sites, PoPs and the resulting consolidated financial ratio for Cellnex, with an impact from inorganic growth explaining the main changes. Despite this effect, we have continued to optimize our network through decommissioning and managed to grow organically by adding tenants in the 2 countries where we are present.
During the period, we have increased the number of PoPs by 4.5% in just 6 months, with even new PoPs on Galata towers in just 3 months of operations. I would like to say to you that we think that the company is presenting a very strong organic growth.
In the next slide, we have separated contribution from organic growth in our adjusted EBITDA for a more visual explanation. I think we will be able to see these in Slide 11.
Slide #9, in the meantime, income statement. Let me now please spend some time on our income statement in detail.
Looking to revenues, we have suffered a negative impact from the shutdown of 9 DTT channels that took place in May 2014. But, however, this effect has been offset by the simulcast broadcast on the same content on 2 different frequencies carried out in the first 3 months of 2015. Please take into account that this is a one-off effect in the year.
Telecom site rental increased mainly due to inorganic growth, with additional contribution from all our recent transactions, both in Spain and Italy. And network services and other increases when compared to last year as well.
Moving to OpEx. We have a very well-contained cost base with a flat performance on a like-for-like basis. The increase you can see on our P&L is mainly due to cost linked to our recent acquisitions, incremental costs, which are treated as pass-through, and also nonrecurring items. As the year progress, we expect efficiencies to become even more visible on our P&L.
After adding back these nonrecurring items and noncash effects, our adjusted EBITDA reaches EUR 115 million, a strong 26% increase when compared to the same period last year.
Depreciation and amortization increases EUR 31 million as a result of our recent acquisitions and income tax decreases as a result of the optimization measures carried out during the year.
Cellnex net profit reaches EUR 18 million, decreasing when compared to last year due to the effects I already explained, that is the one-off effects, nonrecurring items, and secondly, the current depreciation and amortization policy of the company.
On a like-for-like basis, this net profit attributable to the parent would have been EUR 34 million without these effects instead of EUR 18 million.
Finally, the increase in non-M&A expansion CapEx is explained by the works carried out in the context of DTT, EUR 5 million, which also translates into more revenues in the period, as explained earlier.
Slide #10 shows the financial performance regarding the telecom site rental revenues, and you can see how the existing asset base contributes EUR 4 million on an organic growth basis. We do think that these EUR 4 million represent a strong organic performance. On top of that, inorganic growth, or in other words, M&A growth, represent EUR 77 million of revenues.
All these details can be or have been explained in the excel sheet that you will be able to find also in our website.
Moving to Slide 11 and talking about adjusted EBITDA. As you know, adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit from operations before depreciation and amortization and after adding back advance to customers and first-time nonrecurring items. As you can see in the graph, the adjusted EBITDA has suffered a one-off impact due to the channels shut down, but also you can see that the M&A activity represents EUR 29 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 first semester. And on top of that, you can see that from an organic growth perspective, the company has been able to generate EUR 4 million of more EBITDA. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA 2015 first semester accounts for EUR 115 million.
In the next slide, we will be able to assess the adjusted EBITDA margin. As you know, as of June 2014, our EBITDA margin accounted for 43%. And on a like-for-like basis, without M&A impacts and without one-off impacts on broadcast, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA margin as of June 2015 is 44%. That is 1% margin increase over existing tower base as of 2014. This is due to our strong operating leverage.
As a result of the impacts previously explained, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the first semester 2015 is diluted to 40%. We expect that once the one-off impacts from broadcast disappear, and also we improve our performance on Galata, our adjusted EBITDA margin will increase in the next semesters.
Moving now to Slide 13 and talking about the recurring levered free cash flow. It is important to note that our strong growth in adjusted EBITDA is -- represents 26% increase, and even stronger in recurring levered free cash flow with a 36% increase. Additionally, we have managed to keep our sound cash conversion ratio of 98% in terms of recurring operating free cash flow and 89% in terms of recurring levered free cash flow, even with temporary negative impacts from our broadcasting unit.
Our working capital change remains very low and cash tax decreases, which as I already mentioned, focused on tax optimization.
Maintenance CapEx has been very low during the first semester, although the situation is expected to reverse in the second half of the year to normalized levels.
Finally, M&A CapEx increases due to our last transactions, Galata and the Phase 2 of Volta Extended.
Regarding our shareholding -- shareholder remuneration, and as you can read in this slide, it is our current intention to pay out our first dividend during the fourth -- in the last part of the year, corresponding to at least 20% of our recurring levered free cash flow from our results for the second half of the year. Please also note that this dividend has to be commensurate also with our leverage profile, our growth strategy and net profit attributable to the parent.
Next slide, moving to our balance sheet. Cellnex is increasing the size of its total assets by approximately EUR 1 billion due to the impact of Galata and the other acquisitions. And as you can see also here, our goodwill is only increasing by EUR 71 million, following our very prudent purchase price allocation policy.
Our total equity has remained similar to 2014, and the change is mainly due to the net profit. Moreover, we have increased our total borrowings by EUR 777 million in order to accomplish our acquisitions. As of June 2015, our leverage ratio was in line with our long-term leverage target of 4x net debt/EBITDA.
In Slide 15, financial performance. As you know, the 20th of July, we successfully completed our inaugural debt capital market transaction, with a EUR 600 million bond with a 7-year maturity and coupon of 3.12%. The bond was 6x oversubscribed in a very challenging market conditions. We have managed to carry out these transactions in this market volatility, and we think that at the same time, achieving an excellent result.
Our capital structure, as you can see in Slide 16, have changed significantly, and we have managed to extend our maturities at a competitive price, remove all of our covenants. Also, we have not only removed covenants but also -- and guarantees. We have also partially hedged our interest rates, and at the same time, diversified our source of funding. This creates the right platform to execute M&A projects, which are analyzed under strict value-creation criteria with a view to maximize the current free cash flow per share while minimizing the potential for capital increases.
Slide 17, M&A activity update. Just a quick look now to our recent M&A track record. With our last transformational leased deal in Italy just 4 months ago, we have managed to acquire an average of 3,000 towers per annum in the last 4 years.
As an update on Galata, the entity is performing as per our projections with an expected full year EBITDA of EUR 62 million, which implies an acquisition multiple of 12.4x in terms of enterprise value EBITDA.
As you can see in this slide, we commit, at the time of the IPO, with a very clear EBITDA performance regarding Galata, and we are already delivering the result to the market and our shareholders.
As you know, we keep extremely active analyzing new M&A opportunities in order to make the most for the European tower outsourcing opportunity as a way to maximize value creation for our shareholders.
Financial outlook, next slide, guidance for full year 2015 in terms of adjusted EBITDA. As you can see, we are changing our guidance for 2015. And let me explain to you how we are able to reach EUR 235 million of adjusted EBITDA for full year 2015.
It's very important to explain that there are partial effects that need to be understood in order to properly project our medium-term performance. First, this first semester includes, among other recurring activities, 3 months of simulcast, which is a one-off; 3 months only of Galata; and 5 months only of Phase 2 of project Volta Extended. During the second half, we will see 6 months of both Phase 2 of Volta Extended and also Galata. These, coupled with expected organic growth and further cost contention, will leave our full year adjusted EBITDA for 2015 at around EUR 235 million, above the current market consensus.
In order to project 2016, we expect to recover around EUR 35 million of revenues linked to the retendering of TV capacity, simulcast contribution in 2015 as we remove, and the contribution of 3 additional months of Galata and 1 additional month of Volta Extended Phase 2 must be included.
Next slide, Slide 19. As a reminder of additional items to be considered when assessing our full year 2015 results, we not only expect our adjusted EBITDA to reach around EUR 235 million, but also our maintenance CapEx should represent circa 3.5% of total revenues. Our working capital change should turn to neutral, and both interest paid and tax paid for the second semester should be similar to the amounts paid in the first semester.
And finally, Slide 20, just a reminder of Cellnex main highlights of the first semester 2015. First, we have managed to show a strong performance in the telecom site rental business based on organic growth and accretive acquisitions. Second, uncertainties surrounding our broadcasting business have completely disappeared. Third, we have taken the first step of our future efficiency program with encouraging results as of today. Fourth, we keep generating cash while strict controlling our CapEx. Five, we have successfully issued our inaugural bond, creating a stable capital structure for the long term at a competitive cost without any covenant. And finally, and as a result of a good performance, we have revised our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance to circa EUR 235 million.
And with this, I would like to open the line for answer your questions."

You are right when you say that the first semester of 2016 has shown a very strong organic growth. Hopefully -- in fact, we are working to sustain this organic growth in the next semesters, but it's something that we cannot right now share to you. What we can tell you is that the company is fully, fully focused on organic growth and is trying to reach several agreements with different clients. And hopefully, we will be able to present to you some good results also in the next semesters. Regarding your second question, you talked about Inwit and you talked about Telefonica in Germany. Let me tell you that Cellnex is focused on whole Europe. And there are some potential transactions that are visible and others that are not visible, and we are paying attention to all of them. And these non-visible potential transactions are not only focused on Spain but also in other European countries. So again, the company is also working in this regard. And as you know, M&A in this field takes time, requires scouting, requires explaining very well to different stakeholders what the value of Cellnex can bring to the table. This takes time. But however, as you have been able to see our track record, we commit and deliver. And I'm pretty sure that we will be able to execute some transactions, maybe not all of them very visible right now. And also, let me remind you that, for us, it's very important to meet our investment criteria, we'll call them goals. So it's not only a question of having a clear target, it's a question of meeting the criteria of value creation for our shareholders, and at the same time, cash flow visibility for our bondholders. And finally, the third question was regarding broadcasting. As commented before, the deadlines defined by the Spanish government as of April 2015 are in time. The process is on track. It's very difficult for me to tell you that we will have 1.75 MUXs, multiplexes, working from January 1 or from December 1, 2015, or from February 1, 2016. It's extremely difficult. What I can tell you is that the company is fully prepared to bring back these revenues as soon as possible. And so far, this process is working very well."

As you say, yes, Fernando, the company is performing well also because our clients are making the investments and are working well also. But let me remind you a very important theme, Fernando. In terms of organic growth, the company does not only depend on the deployment policy of the 4G, of the networks, but also on the decommissioning or rationalization propositions that we are working on. In the Slide #4, Fernando, we are raising a very important point. We are suggesting that currently, the company is working with several opportunities in both Spain and Italy that represent a potential of 2,000 towers to be decommissioned or rationalized in the next semesters. So I think that Cellnex is well prepared not only to benefit from the MNOs deployment, 4G deployment, but also from the rationalization or dismantling projects that we are working on. And your first question, Fernando, was in terms of the second term of the year. So I understand your question was from March to June 2015. I will say to you that this business is quite lumpy, okay? This is not a steady growth. And when we talk to our clients, maybe it takes time until we are able to close some organic growth transactions. But it's quite lumpy. So for instance, you can have some terms in which you increase your growth more than others. But however, talking about this semester of 2015, talking about this 4.5% of organic growth, I think that in the next terms, it is relatively sustainable. Okay?"

Now which sort of time frame are we talking about? Do you talk about semester or semesters? And could you give us a sort of flavor in terms of what sort of decommission costs you would bear for that and the sort of payback for these projects? The second question is related to the framework agreements. Is it possible to have a bit of granularity? The first one is the non-anchor tenant renewal. There is a EUR 4 million additional in revenues, so I assume that the rent has increased. And I was wondering if it's just because of recovery inflations, the increase due to more service provided or other factors. And the third is the wireless broadband operator we mentioned here. Is that a wireless operator or is basically a different HO [ph] operator?"

First question, you were talking about the tower operators, and the answer is yes. The answer is yes to your question. I will say to you that in terms of the timing, I am clearly suggesting semesters, so it's several semesters. And not only -- I think this is a long-term work. We are working with different angles, and it takes time. So I think that this semester, the current semester, maybe we'll see something. But for sure, the first semester of 2016, we should be able to see another, let's say, effort or another step-up. When you talk about the costs and the payback, we -- is the same for we shared with you at the time of the IPO. Our dismantling cost is around EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per site dismantled. And the payback, when you ask about the paybacks, this is something that is quite -- we would like to be very prudent regarding paybacks, but let me suggest to you that it is not currently a question of payback, it's a question of payback in relation with the underlying contract, with the timing of underlying contracts. So payback can be very short if your underlying contract is short, but payback can be more if your underlying contract is longer. So it's something that when presenting to you the results of these rationalization projects, we would like to present to you both outcomes to make comparable the effects. This was regarding your third question. Your second question was regarding framework agreements. Regarding the framework agreements, you are right, the non-anchor tenant renewal is -- has increasingly a very clear tariff scheme, a new tariff scheme, which implies more tariff, okay? So while there are several reasons. At the end of the day, obviously, what I can tell you is that this new tariff scheme -- or the previous tariff scheme was not optimized, and this new tariff scheme is now fully optimized. And this is a very good example of Cellnex delivering value not only to clients but also to the shareholders in the long term. As we have explained before, and this is an industrial company, a neutral carrier, independent carrier, which allow us to give value to our customers and, therefore, creating value for our shareholders. And this

kind of agreements can only be reached between an independent company and [indiscernible]. Your third question was about the wireless broadband operators.

The first question is on Italian wireless consolidation. I saw an article, I think on Bloomberg, just a week ago, saying that VimpelCom and Hutch are closer to completing a deal in Italy and that an announcement could come over the next couple of weeks. Could you just say what opportunities you feel this deal could present to you in terms of perhaps buying towers off the merged co., or maybe winning secondary tenants as some towers are decommissioned by the Italian merged co., assuming that deal does go ahead? And in the event that an Italian merger does happen, clearly, Inwit, I guess, would be interested in bidding for towers or bidding for opportunities. And what advantage do you think you might have over Inwit in that scenario? That's my first question. And then the second question, a little bit easier, it's on expansion CapEx. Where do you see your focus here in the next couple of years? Is it really on decommissioning, as you are suggesting today? Or is there also build to suit and maybe Internet of Things as well?"

Yes, I think that our focus in the next semesters regarding expansion CapEx will be decommissioning. This is a key point for us. This is a key point. There will be, of course, other things like build to suit, there will be also Internet of Things, because we -- you can find this in the IOM [ph], in the Forgeto [ph]. This information is very clear in Spain. We have a company that from a diversified and a legal perspective, we are working on the same -- in the next generation of technology, which is Internet of Things, which is, of course, there will be some expansion CapEx. But the bulk, main bulk of the volume will come from decommissioning, as you were suggesting, and we are presenting in the first slides of these results.  Now talking about your first question, and your first question have 2 parts. First part is the impact of potential mergers among these 2 Italian MNOs. So I would suggest to all of you to go to Slide #25 of the presentation that is called European consolidation. And what you can read here is a very clear message that, obviously, these potential mergers have some challenges for us but also opportunities. And we, as you can imagine, when we started the Galata project, we were fully aware of this potential merger between H3G and Wind in Italy. And obviously, we are fully prepared for not only respecting our current value from this contract but also obtaining new value from the merger. And this, for us, is crucial. This is a positive challenge for Cellnex. Let me recall that our contracts are fully protected against any merger. This is the first main concept. And second, we do think Cellnex is very well positioned to design an optimal network to acquire new assets, provide further services and also to carry out a very important, let's say, role in the merger potential synergies that may arise. So when acquiring -- when executing M&A transactions, we try to position ourselves not only fully protect from a value perspective with the deal that we are working on, but also we try to be well positioned to capture more value. You were suggesting acquiring new towers, you are right, but also backhauling services or other things that are explained in Slide #25. So yes, as you can see, fully prepared for this new scenario that we are welcoming, and that will give us, I think, more opportunities to show to the market that a neutral carrier or independent carrier at Cellnex can provide value to the shareholders in very different scenarios that initially could be regarded a challenge. So this is a step we were expecting for. If it happens, we are fully prepared. And then you were also talking about Inwit. And as I said before, other opportunities throughout Europe are part of our potential M&A activity. But I can tell you that the company is fully involved in several potential transactions in Northern Europe also, in, I would say to you, other southern countries and not only in Italy, not only in Inwit. So it's very important to remind, to recall, that Cellnex has a very clear M&A golden rules, and we have to commit with all these golden rules."
