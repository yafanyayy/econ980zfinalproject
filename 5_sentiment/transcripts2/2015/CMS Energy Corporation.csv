Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. 
I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the year before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then we'll close with Q&A. 
2014 adjusted earnings per share were $1.77, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. For 2015, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $1.85 to $1.86 per share. The top end remains the same at $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% off last year's actual performance. 
Last week, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%.
2014 was another successful year, both financially and operationally. The settlement of the gas rate case was constructive at $45 million, with a 10.3% return on equity. We achieved our 10% renewable energy target 1 year ahead of schedule with the completion of the 111-megawatt Cross Winds Energy Park. 
In addition to improving customer satisfaction scores and moving towards a more competitive rate design, we invested a record $1.7 billion in the utility, in the areas of system reliability, environmental compliance, gas infrastructure and technology. These projects add value to our customers and deliver financial results for our shareholders. 
Our strategy is centered around breakthrough thinking over the long term. We begin by focusing on operational excellence and maintaining our first quartile cost performance. By the end of this year, we will have reduced O&M expense by $150 million since 2006, a 13% decrease on an absolute basis. We are able to grow organically with no big bets through our transparent, 10-year, $15.5 billion capital investment plan. 
This year, we anticipate comprehensive energy policy in Michigan. The updated law as well as the predicted MISO capacity shortfall next year could provide future opportunities. Last week, we received an 18-month air permit extension for Sadford [ph] Gas Plant. This will provide us optionality to meet the capacity shortfall, but it is not in our plan. 
We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers, and to first quartile for residential customers, a significant improvement over the past 4 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable financial results. 
The reelection of Governor Snyder and the reappointments of Senator Mike Nofs and House of Representative Aric Nesbett as chairs of their respective energy committees adds stability in the political environment. The commission remains chaired by John Quackenbush, and we anticipate the appointment of a new Commissioner to replace Greg White, who will be retiring midyear. We look forward to working with these respected leaders to advance energy policy.
Energy policy is a priority for the governor, as he mentioned during his State of the State address. He wants an energy policy that will be adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. The Governor also announced that he is creating a new agency to better coordinate energy policy in the state. He is expected to offer more details when he delivers an energy message in March. 
The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term, as Michigan moves towards less coal and more natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. We look forward to working with the Governor to support his goals.
Each year, we build our growth off prior year's actual result. Our model has continued to produce predictable results that build on the high end of performance. And the company's organic growth strategy continues to support the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. 
For 2015, we expect more breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety our top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our industry-leading cost performance puts us in a desirable position, but we're not done. Again this year, we expect to take out more costs to increase productivity while maintaining a high level of employee engagement. 
By improving customer value and quality of service, we will continue to increase customer satisfaction. This year, we have an opportunity to work with policymakers on a new energy law that will secure Michigan's energy future for the next decade and more. All of this and deliver the predictable financial performance as we have in the past. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. Afte",1386,"Well, thanks, John. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. 
I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. After John mentioned, the full year results had $1.77 a share, up $0.11 or 7% from 2013. As you can see here in the left shaded circle, cost savings fully funded our capital investment in 2014. We avoided both gas and electric rate cases for 2014. We also put to work the substantial upside from better-than-planned cost performance and favorable weather in substantial O&M reinvestments. These approached $100 million in 2014 on top of a similar amount in 2013. 
This line, which I suspect is familiar now to almost all of you, shows how on top of large planned cost reductions of $150 million in 2014, we further reduced our cost by $21 million. This and the colder-than-normal weather in the earlier part of the year provided room for substantial O&M reinvestment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and prefund parent debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk profile. It makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and to deliver consistent, high-end earnings per share growth.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2014, but please recall, we had cautioned earlier in the year that we might fall short of our cash flow target. We're delighted to report today that we were able to accomplish additional working capital improvements to achieve the operating cash flow objective of $1.45 billion.
Now looking ahead to 2015. You can see that the O&M reinvestments we made in 2014 already are bearing benefits. Much of our capital investment is self-funded by our own cost reductions. And half of the rate increases needed for 2015 already are in place. We've got a nice, fast start to the year. 
Earlier this month, we settled our 2015 gas rate case, our first since 2013, at $45 million. This included continuation of our return on equity at 10.3%. The 2015 electric rate case is well underway. It has 3 distinct features. First, it provides us with the opportunity to provide the purchase of the new Jackson gas plant in rate base when our customers need the capacity. And we're proud to do it at one of the lowest purchase prices for gas plant ever paid. Second, we'll be recovering the portion of our customer reinvestments, or investments, that we have not already self-funded with cost reduction. And then last, this case includes a new rate design, which permits residential customers to stay fully competitive and allows industrial customers to become more competitive.
Electric residential bills are below the national average. Industrial rates are above the Midwest average, and we have a solid plan to improve. Driven by our own cost reductions, improved rate design and the prospect that subsidies for ROA customers will disappear, industrial rates can be competitive, too. ROA customers may return to bundled service because of policy changes or, naturally, as capacity prices normalize. This would end the existing subsidy worth about $150 million. 
Here's our standard sensitivity table to permit you to evaluate our outlook. 
Here's our report card for 2015. We continue consistent, high-end earnings growth at $1.86 to $1.89 or up 5% to 7% from the high-end 2014 results. Operating cash flow should grow another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 and with no big bets. Last week, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and plan to stay in the 60% to the 70% payout range. Importantly, our total price changes for electric and gas customers will reflect reductions of 3%. Yes, reductions of 3%, further increasing competitive value for our customers. Our balance sheet and CapEx measures are strong, and we're able to self-fund our organic CapEx programs with cost reductions and NOLs. 
Shifting to the longer term. Our future plan includes healthy levels of investment, O&M cost reductions, modest sales growth and a continuation of the 2008 energy law. Both earnings per share and the dividend should grow 5% to 7% each year. Our mix of capital spending during the last 10 years will shift and grow over the next 10 years. We'll be putting more capital investment into gas infrastructure and electric reliability as we continue investment in other important parts of the business. Capital investment grows 45%, with no big bets. 
O&M costs, net of increases, continued to plummet, with reductions of 2% in 2012, 3% in 2013, 3% in 2014 and we project another 3% in 2015. Compared with our last call, cost reductions are even bigger. In 2014 and 2015, O&M costs are down 3% each year instead of the 2% we previously reported. This progress reflects our conservative planning, followed by better performance. 
Since 2006, we've reduced our cost by 7% through 2013, and with acceleration just discussed in 2014 and '15, we've got a fast start at accumulative cost reduction of 17% by 2018. 
Weather-normalized sales growth in 2014 was stronger than forecast. 2015 looks stronger than we thought as well, with electric industrial sales up 3% and overall sales up 1%. We still intend to plan 2016 to 2019 conservatively with our estimate of industrial sales up 2% and overall sales up 0.5%. 
We plan to grow operating cash flow by other $100 million to $1,550,000,000 in 2015. That's up $500 million from 5 years ago, and we expect gross operating cash flow to rise to $2.4 billion by 2019, up another $500 million. Our operating cash flow levels already exceed peers. 
So here's a summary of what we have in our plan, with consistent earnings growth at 5% to 7% a year and good dividend growth that reflects the same. Since 2007, we've raised our dividend every year and, on average, by 25% a year. 
Now there are several areas, however, that are not reflected in our plan. These are meaningful upsides. Our capital spending could be substantially higher. Our sales growth and our cost reductions also could be better. In addition, our plan does not assume any changes to the energy law such as changes to retail open access, renewables or energy efficiency standards. These may all result in large upsides. 
Our capital investment plans over the next 10 years are $15.5 billion, as we mentioned, up 45% from the last 10 years. And there's an opportunity to increase that level by another 30%. We work to incorporate these opportunities without adding pressure to customer prices. 
Now here's a great example of that. One aspect that's still not included in our plan is new capacity investment. Should ROA customers return to bundled service by their response to policy or market changes, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we will need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills by $0.01. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at consumers. None of this is in our present plan. 
On top of capacity needed by consumers, the Ford GT, or ileus Ferrari in the garage, is fired up. Capacity prices have begun to increase in the Midwest, and there's an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvements of another $20 million to $40 million. We already have locked in $10 million, moving from $5 million to $15 million, with an opportunity to add further $20 million to $40 million. And that is not yet in our plan. 
While we have an enviable organic growth plan, we had upsides: 30% more CapEx, new energy law improvements, higher sales, deeper cost reductions and higher capacity prices. Our track record's pretty good. Our planned future is brighter than the past, and that's before any of these likely upsides.
We're committed to high-end earnings and dividend growth, continuing our track record of a dozen years. We're committed to rapidly improving customer satisfaction with better value and performance. We are committed to our customers and to you, our investors. 
We thank you for your interest and your continuing support. We'll be delighted to take your questions. So Laurie, would you please open up the lines?"

The Governor was pretty clear in the State of the State that he does want to move forward energy policy. I think the situation that has occurred in the Upper Peninsula, as you referred to, really highlights the need to do something here in Michigan to take care of our customers with a Michigan companies and not let MISO or the federal government step in to solve the issue that they were talking about before. So -- what they did in the UP. So I think the timing of changing it is good. As far as the renewable energy, energy efficiency, that will all be part of the mix. I think it's important for us to look at the balanced portfolio, which includes what we're doing by reducing our coal fleet, reducing the number of units in our coal fleet, increasing the gas. And I think the renewable energy standard will come, one way or another, continue to grow in the state of Michigan. And I think that's good. I think it's good for our customers, but it will be healthy debate with the Republicans in the House, Senate and the and ministration for the level that we choose. As far as the 50% in the 2008 law, I don't expect -- I mean, one of the things that we've been able to do, which is attributed to the team, is build the renewable energy cheaper than we have purchasing it from other people. And that's very clear in what we've done over the past several years and the 2008 energy law. So if the intent of the law is to increase renewable energy and do it for our customers and do it in a cost-effective fashion, we ought to be able to do it all ourselves."

The Michigan Governor and administration and others stepped in again then to prevent that from happening and then have their own solution, which I think really determined that the Michigan solution for Michigan customers is best. And the one thing I'd still don't know is what the impact to the Upper Peninsula customers will be when this is all said and done. What we were able to determine before this deal was cut is that half of the customers up north would see a significant increase in rates on January 1, and that's been postponed. So the reality, the unintended consequence of full deregulation, which, in essence, is what happened in the Upper Peninsula because of the one company going to a different provider really is playing out now in a way that is causing a lot of people to question this hybrid market that we have here in Michigan."

When you look at tath we -- on a bill basis, we continue to natural gas business will start theirs as very solid because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the price of natural gas coming down. What you see on electric side is that Tom highlighted a couple of his slides there, you see a couple of things we can continue to grow capacity or grow our capacity, build it while customers come back from ROA. We hope that this customers return. We have $150 million of subsidies that go away that could be put into paying for the additional capital that we have. Longer term, we have several long-term purchase power agreements that are higher than market. And I think one of the size that Tom showed you there today is that as we terminate those contracts, as they sunset, we're able to build capacity and save our customers' money. And the one thing, I think, everybody knows, but I'll just mention it again, one of the reasons we can continue our owing them and we don't have O&M reductions, and we don't an end to this, is we've addressed the legacy issues, which, I think, we're one of the few companies that have done that across the board including the union. Those are the benefits that we keep giving to us year over year over year as we turn over the workforce. The other issue, too, is we invest capital. We invest capital for several reasons, but two areas that are important to emphasize here. We invest capital to reduce O&M and reduce capital to reduce our fuel costs. And there's several examples going to all this, Iowa to give you but when you think about smart meters. We're installing smart meters. We're almost at 700,000 smart meters. We invest capital, improve customer satisfaction with the ability to read accurately all the time, to help our distribution operation and to eliminate the O&M cost of are reading the meters. this is going to continue as we shut down the 7 coal plants. We have a larger workforce compared to getting the same amount of megawatts and capacity out of our gas plants with much fewer associated costs. So this feature, I see, that I think Tom refer to it as bright. SES bright. We scratch the surface now, and now we're starting to see some of the things that we did a few years ago, pay dividends as we go forward in the future."

They will actually help our energy intensive customers reduce their rates by 16%, overall, our industrial customers by 10%. And in the offset that comes on the residential side, we cover that. We cover that by skipping rate cases, by being more productive. And when you look at the Slide #17 about electric customer prices, that really shows how it works. That shows we're able to keep our residential builds well below the national average and put rate designs in place among with all of the things to do to ticker our industrial rates and bring them down close to or into the competitive area.

To give you a better feel for what ahead, 2015 compared to what we did in 2014, we're going to get another 3% out, even though, everyone's aware that almost all companies had to reflect the mortality tables. That cost us $35 million and the new discount rates. And for us, that cost us a little over $20 million. So right there, there's $55 million of higher cost. We count it all. We don't adjust it out. We don't say, ""That's terrible. We won't come that stuff."" We fully offset the with better pull top maintenance that we're doing. There's work in that area that will allow us to be more productive and efficient with what we're doing in O&M. There's $25 million to $30 million there. Our productivity across the board, higher quality improvement, is another $30 million. Here's a place where you throwing money down the trash can. Our uncollectible accounts have gone up a little bit in the last year or 2, and no customer's interested in that, and neither are you. So we're looking to get $20 million improvement in those uncollectible accounts. IT productivity gets us another $15 million. Remember the Classic 7? Are we getting prepared to go away? So some of that cost begins to go away. There's about $7 million in there overhead on 2 [ph] expensive, when they build get rid of me, but not yet. But that's another $500 million of overhead that we have planned to go away this year. So there were a mixture of things in I just went through, that are Richard, a little better than what we have told you previously. So instead of being down 2%, you know we were already looking at all these items. We just didn't want to promise till we felt good about getting them. We're now at 3%. And candidly, our internal numbers are a bigger reduction than that. But 3% is all we're willing to put on the table at this point for 2015."

And we had had, in the past, when the invoice would come in, some of our folks -- it was due, say, on January 10, they would just do one transaction, authorize that and we paid in December. What we do now is we put it in the record that we're going to pay it in January, and we don't pay in December, we paid when it's do, not late and not early. So that was a good chunk. We had some money out with other people on deposits that were due to come back to us in January and February, and our operational team was able to work with us folks and just say, ""Could we get that cash back since everything that was needed to be complied with was done in 2014?""

Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. 
I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the year before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then we'll close with Q&A. 
2014 adjusted earnings per share were $1.77, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. For 2015, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $1.85 to $1.86 per share. The top end remains the same at $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% off last year's actual performance. 
Last week, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%.
2014 was another successful year, both financially and operationally. The settlement of the gas rate case was constructive at $45 million with a 10.3% return on equity. We achieved our 10% renewable energy target 1 year ahead of schedule with the completion of the 111-megawatt Cross Winds Energy Park. 
In addition to improving customer satisfaction scores and moving towards a more competitive rate design, we invested a record $1.7 billion in the utility, in the areas of system reliability, environmental compliance, gas infrastructure and technology. These projects add value to our customers and deliver financial results for our shareholders. 
Our strategy is centered around breakthrough thinking over the long term. We begin by focusing on operational excellence and maintaining our first quartile cost performance. By the end of this year, we will have reduced O&M expense by $150 million since 2006, a 13% decrease on an absolute basis. We are able to grow organically with no big bets through our transparent, 10-year, $15.5 billion capital investment plan. 
This year, we anticipate comprehensive energy policy in Michigan. The updated law as well as the predicted MISO capacity shortfall next year could provide future opportunities. Last week, we received an 18-month air permit extension for Thetford gas plant. This will provide us optionality to meet a capacity shortfall but it is not in our plan. 
We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers, and to first quartile for residential customers; a significant improvement over the past 4 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable financial results. 
The reelection of Governor Snyder and the reappointments of Senator Mike Nofs and House Representative Aric Nesbitt, as chairs of their respective energy committees, add stability in the political environment. The commission remains chaired by John Quackenbush and we anticipate the appointment of a new Commissioner to replace Greg White, who will be retiring midyear. We look forward to working with these respected leaders to advance energy policy.
Energy policy is a priority for the Governor, as he mentioned during his State of the State Address. He wants an energy policy that will be adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. The Governor also announced that he is creating a new agency to better coordinate energy policy in the state. He is expected to offer more details when he delivers an energy message in March. 
The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves towards less coal and more natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. We look forward to working with the Governor to support his goals.
Each year, we build our growth off prior year's actual result. Our model has continued to produce predictable results that build on the high end of performance. And the company's organic growth strategy continues to support the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. 
For 2015, we expect more breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety our top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our industry-leading cost performance puts us in a desirable position but we're not done. Again this year, we expect to take out more costs to increase productivity while maintaining a high level of employee engagement. 
By improving customer value and quality of service, we will continue to increase customer satisfaction. This year, we have an opportunity to work with policymakers on a new energy law that will secure Michigan's energy future for the next decade and more. All of this and deliver the predictable financial performance as we have in the past. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As J",1387,"Well, thanks, John. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. 
I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As John mentioned, the full year results at $1.77 a share, up $0.11 or 7% from 2013. As you can see here in the left shaded circle, cost savings fully funded our capital investment in 2014. We avoided both gas and electric rate cases for 2014. We also put to work the substantial upside from better-than-planned cost performance and favorable weather in substantial O&M reinvestments. These approached $100 million in 2014 on top of a similar amount in 2013. 
This slide, which I suspect is familiar now to almost all of you, shows how on top of large planned cost reductions of $150 million in 2014, we further reduced our cost by $21 million. This and the colder-than-normal weather in the earlier part of the year provided room for substantial O&M reinvestment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and prefund parent debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk profile, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and to deliver consistent, high-end earnings per share growth.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2014. But please recall, we had cautioned earlier in the year that we might fall short of our cash flow target. We're delighted to report today that we are able to accomplish additional working capital improvements to achieve the operating cash flow objective of $1.45 billion.
Now looking ahead to 2015. You can see that the O&M reinvestments we made in 2014 already are bearing benefits. Much of our capital investment is self-funded by our own cost reductions, and half of the rate increases needed for 2015 already are in place. We've got a nice, fast start to the year. 
Earlier this month, we settled our 2015 gas rate case, our first since 2013, at $45 million. This included continuation of our return on equity at 10.3%. The 2015 electric rate case is well underway. It has 3 distinct features: first, it provides us with the opportunity to provide the purchase of the new Jackson gas plant in a rate base when our customers need the capacity, and we're proud to do it at one of the lowest purchase prices for a gas plant ever paid; second, we'll be recovering the portion of our customer reinvestments or investments, that we have not already self-funded with cost reductions; and then last, this case includes a new rate design, which permits residential customers to stay fully competitive and allows industrial customers to become more competitive.
Electric residential bills are below the national average. Industrial rates are above the Midwest average and we have a solid plan to improve. Driven by our own cost reductions, improved rate design, and the prospect that subsidies for ROA customers will disappear, industrial rates can be competitive, too. ROA customers may return to bundled service because of policy changes or naturally as capacity prices normalize. This would end the existing subsidy worth about $150 million. Here's our standard sensitivity table to permit you to evaluate our outlook. 
Here's our report card for 2015. We continue consistent, high-end earnings growth at $1.86 to $1.89 or up 5% to 7% from the high-end 2014 results. Operating cash flow should grow another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 and with no big bets. Last week, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and plan to stay in the 60% to 70% payout range. Importantly, our total price changes for electric and gas customers will reflect reductions of 3%. Yes, reductions of 3%, further increasing competitive value for our customers. Our balance sheet and CapEx measures are strong, and we're able to self-fund our organic CapEx programs with cost reductions and NOLs. 
Shifting to the longer term. Our future plan includes: healthy levels of investment; O&M cost reductions; modest sales growth; and a continuation of the 2008 energy law. Both earnings per share and the dividend should grow 5% to 7% each year. Our mix of capital spending during the last 10 years will shift and grow over the next 10 years. We'll be putting more capital investment into gas infrastructure and electric reliability as we continue investment in other important parts of the business. Capital investment grows 45% with no big bets. 
O&M costs, net of increases, continued to plummet with reductions of 2% in 2012, 3% in 2013, 3% in 2014, and we project another 3% in 2015. Compared with our last call, cost reductions are even bigger. In 2014 and 2015, O&M costs are down 3% each year instead of the 2% we previously reported. This progress reflects our conservative planning followed by better performance. Since 2006, we've reduced our cost by 7% through 2013, and with the acceleration, just discussed in 2014 and '15, we've got a fast start at accumulative cost reduction of 17% by 2018. 
Weather-normalized sales growth in 2014 was stronger than forecast. 2015 looks stronger than we thought as well, with electric industrial sales up 3% and overall sales up 1%. We still intend to plan 2016 to 2019 conservatively with our estimated industrial sales up 2% and overall sales up 0.5%. 
We plan to grow operating cash flow by other $100 million to $1,550,000,000 in 2015. That's up $500 million from 5 years ago, and we expect gross operating cash flow to rise to $2.4 billion by 2019, up another $500 million. Our operating cash flow levels already exceed peers. 
So here's a summary of what we have in our plan, with consistent earnings growth at 5% to 7% a year and good dividend growth that reflects the same. Since 2007, we've raised our dividend every year and on average by 25% a year. 
Now there are several areas, however, that are not reflected in our plan. These are meaningful upsides. Our capital spending could be substantially higher. Our sales growth and our cost reductions also could be better. In addition, our plan does not assume any changes to the energy laws such as: changes to retail open access, renewables, or energy efficiency standards. These may all result in large upsides. 
Our capital investment plans over the next 10 years are $15.5 billion, as we mentioned, up 45% from the last 10 years and there's an opportunity to increase that level by another 30%. We'll work to incorporate these opportunities without adding pressure to customer prices. 
Now here's a great example of that. One aspect that's still not included in our plan is new capacity investment. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either in response to policy or market changes, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills by $0.01. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at consumers. None of this is in our present plan. 
On top of capacity needed at consumers, the Ford GT or alias Ferrari in the garage is fired up. Capacity prices have begun to increase in the Midwest and there is an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvements of another $20 million to $40 million. We already have locked in $10 million, moving from $5 million to $15 million, with an opportunity to add further $20 million to $40 million and that is not yet in our plan. 
While we have an enviable organic growth plan, we had upsides: 30% more CapEx; new energy law improvements; higher sales; deeper cost reductions; and higher capacity prices. Our track record's pretty good. Our planned future is brighter than the past and that's before any of these likely upsides.
We're committed to high-end earnings and dividend growth, continuing our track record of a dozen years. We're committed to rapidly improving customer satisfaction with better value and performance. We are committed to our customers and to you, our investors. 
We thank you for your interest and your continuing support. We'd be delighted to take your questions. So Laurie, would you please open up the lines?"

The Governor was pretty clear in the State of the State that he does want to move forward with energy policy. I think the situation that has occurred in the Upper Peninsula, as you referred to, really highlights the need to do something here in Michigan to take care of our customers with the Michigan companies, and not let MISO or the federal government step in to solve the issue that they were talking about before, so -- or what they did in the UP. So I think the timing of changing it is good. As far as the renewable energy, energy efficiency, that will all be part of the mix. I think it's important for us to look at the balanced portfolio, which includes what we're doing by reducing our coal fleet -- reducing the number of units in our coal fleet, increasing the gas. And I think the renewable energy standard will come, one way or another, continue to grow in the State of Michigan, and I think that's good. I think it's good for our customers, but it will be a healthy debate with the Republicans in the House, Senate and the administration for the level that we choose. As far as the 50% in the 2008 law, I don't expect -- I mean, one of the things that we've been able to do, which is attributed to the team, is build the renewable energy cheaper than we have purchasing it from other people. And that's very clear in what we've done over the past several years and the 2008 energy law. So if the intent of the law is to increase renewable energy and do it for our customers and do it in a cost-effective fashion, we ought to be able to do it all ourselves."

The Michigan Governor and administration and others stepped in again, then, to prevent that from happening and have their own solution, which I think really determined that the Michigan solution for Michigan customers is best. And the one thing I still don't know is what the impact to the Upper Peninsula customers will be when this is all said and done. What we were able to determine before this deal was cut is that half of the customers up north would see a significant increase in rates on January 1, and that's been postponed. So the reality, the unintended consequence of full deregulation, which, in essence, is what happened in the Upper Peninsula because of the one company going to a different provider, really is playing out now in a way that is causing a lot of people to question this hybrid market that we have here in Michigan."

And you can go through the one slide that, I think, is important is for fact that the Governor's back and both the Senate and House are being -- energy committees are being led by experienced leaders. So the good news there is that they don't have to come up to speed. Most of the Senate energy committee has a lot of experience. Most of them had voted for the 2008 energy law. So the good news is, there won't be as much of a catch-up required for them. And the House, there's a lot of new members, so that may require a more time on House side of it.

When you look at that, we -- on a bill basis, we continue -- the natural gas business we'll start there is very solid, because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the prices of natural gas coming down. What you see on the electric side is, that Tom highlighted a couple of his slides there, you see a couple of things. We can continue to grow capacity or grow our capacity, build it while customers come back from ROA. So retail open access customers return, we have $150 million of subsidies that go away, that could be put into paying for the additional capital that we have. Longer term, we have several long-term purchase power agreements that are higher-than-market. And I think one of the slides that Tom showed you there today is, that as we terminate those contracts or they sunset, that we're able to build capacity and save our customers' money. And the one thing, I think, everybody knows, but I'll just mention it again, one of the reasons we can continue our O&M and we don't -- O&M reductions and we don't an end to this, is we've addressed the legacy issues, which, I think, we're one of the few companies that have done that across the board including the union. Those are the benefits that keep giving to us year over, year-over-year as we turn over the workforce. The other issue too, is we invest capital. We invest capital for several reasons, but 2 areas that are important to emphasize here: we invest capital to reduce O&M; and we reduce capital to reduce our fuel costs. And there's several examples going into all this I don't want to give you, but, you think about smart meters. We're installing smart meters, we're almost at 700,000 smart meters, we invest capital, improve customer satisfaction with the ability to read accurately, all the time, to help our distribution operation and to eliminate the O&M cost of reading the meters. And this is going to continue as we shut down the 7 coal plants. We have a larger workforce compared to getting the same amount of megawatts and capacity out of our gas plants with much fewer associated costs. So this future, I see as -- I think, Tom referred to it as bright. I see it as bright. We scratched the surface now, and now, we're starting to see some of the things that we did a few years ago pay dividends as we go forward in the future."

We cover that by skipping rate cases, by being more productive, and when you look at the Slide #17, about electric customer prices, that really shows how it works. That shows we're able to keep our residential bills well below the national average and put rate design in place among -- with all the things to do to take our industrial rates and bring them down close to or into the competitive area.

There's work in that area that will allow us to be more productive and efficient with what we're doing in O&M, there's $25 million to $30 million there. Our productivity across the board, higher quality improvement is another $30 million, here's a place where you're throwing money down the trash can. Our uncollectible accounts have gone up a little bit in the last year or 2 and no customer's interested in that and neither are you. So we're looking to get $20 million improvement in those uncollectible accounts. IT productivity, gets us another $15 million. Remember the Classic 7, were getting prepared to go away so some of that cost begins to go away. There's about $7 million in there. Overhead, I'm too expensive, so 1 day they'll get rid of me, but not yet, but there's another $500 million of overhead that we have planned to go away this year.

So more people will look for capacity and there won't be a lot of it around, and so the opportunities for those prices to naturally go up will occur, we think, in '15 and maybe as late as in '16. So I see us being able to execute contracts on some of the surplus capacity at DIG that we just talked about, in that 500-megawatt-plus zone, in that period. So it may all occur in '16, but I get the sense that there may be a chance yet in '15 as people try to protect themselves appropriately."

Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. 
I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the year before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then we'll close with Q&A. 
2014 adjusted earnings per share were $1.77, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. For 2015, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $1.85 to $1.86 per share. The top end remains the same at $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% off last year's actual performance. 
Last week, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%.
2014 was another successful year, both financially and operationally. The settlement of the gas rate case was constructive at $45 million with a 10.3% return on equity. We achieved our 10% renewable energy target 1 year ahead of schedule with the completion of the 111-megawatt Cross Winds Energy Park. 
In addition to improving customer satisfaction scores and moving towards a more competitive rate design, we invested a record $1.7 billion in the utility, in the areas of system reliability, environmental compliance, gas infrastructure and technology. These projects add value to our customers and deliver financial results for our shareholders. 
Our strategy is centered around breakthrough thinking over the long term. We begin by focusing on operational excellence and maintaining our first quartile cost performance. By the end of this year, we will have reduced O&M expense by $150 million since 2006, a 13% decrease on an absolute basis. We are able to grow organically with no big bets, through our transparent, 10-year, $15.5 billion capital investment plan. 
This year, we anticipate comprehensive energy policy in Michigan. The updated law as well as the predicted MISO capacity shortfall next year could provide future opportunities. Last week, we received an 18-month air permit extension for Thetford gas plant. This will provide us optionality to meet a capacity shortfall but it is not in our plan. 
We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers, and to first quartile for residential customers; a significant improvement over the past 4 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable financial results. 
The reelection of Governor Snyder and the reappointments of Senator Mike Nofs and House Representative Aric Nesbitt, as chairs of their respective energy committees, add stability in the political environment. The commission remains chaired by John Quackenbush and we anticipate the appointment of a new Commissioner to replace Greg White, who will be retiring midyear. We look forward to working with these respected leaders to advance energy policy.
Energy policy is a priority for the Governor, as he mentioned during his State of the State Address. He wants an energy policy that will be adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. The Governor also announced that he is creating a new agency to better coordinate energy policy in the state. He is expected to offer more details when he delivers an energy message in March. 
The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves towards less coal and more natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. We look forward to working with the Governor to support his goals.
Each year, we build our growth off prior year's actual result. Our model has continued to produce predictable results that build on the high end of performance. And the company's organic growth strategy continues to support the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. 
For 2015, we expect more breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety our top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our industry-leading cost performance puts us in a desirable position but we're not done. Again this year, we expect to take out more costs through increase productivity while maintaining a high level of employee engagement. 
By improving customer value and quality of service, we will continue to increase customer satisfaction. This year, we have an opportunity to work with policymakers on a new energy law that will secure Michigan's energy future for the next decade and more. All of this and deliver the predictable financial performance as we have in the past. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today.

As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. 
I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As John mentioned, the full year results at $1.77 a share, are up $0.11 or 7% from 2013. As you can see here in the left shaded circle, cost savings fully funded our capital investment in 2014. We avoided both gas and electric rate cases for 2014. We also put to work the substantial upside from better-than-planned cost performance and favorable weather in substantial O&M reinvestments. These approached $100 million in 2014 on top of a similar amount in 2013. 
This slide, which I suspect is familiar now to almost all of you, shows how on top of large planned cost reductions of $150 million in 2014, we further reduced our cost by $21 million. This and the colder-than-normal weather in the earlier part of the year provided room for substantial O&M reinvestment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and prefund parent debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk profile, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and to deliver consistent, high-end earnings per share growth.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2014. But please recall, we had cautioned earlier in the year that we might fall short of our cash flow target. We're delighted to report today that we are able to accomplish additional working capital improvements to achieve the operating cash flow objective of $1.45 billion.
Now looking ahead to 2015. You can see that the O&M reinvestments we made in 2014 already are bearing benefits. Much of our capital investment is self-funded by our own cost reductions, and half of the rate increases needed for 2015 already are in place. We've got a nice, fast start to the year. 
Earlier this month, we settled our 2015 gas rate case, our first since 2013, at $45 million. This included continuation of our return on equity at 10.3%. The 2015 electric rate case is well underway. It has 3 distinct features: first, it provides us with the opportunity to put the purchase of the new Jackson gas plant in a rate base when our customers need the capacity, and we're proud to do it at one of the lowest purchase prices for a gas plant ever paid; second, we'll be recovering the portion of our customer reinvestments -- or investments, that we have not already self-funded with cost reductions; and then last, this case includes a new rate design, which permits residential customers to stay fully competitive and allows industrial customers to become more competitive.
Electric residential bills are below the national average. Industrial rates are above the Midwest average and we have a solid plan to improve. Driven by our own cost reductions, improved rate design, and the prospect that subsidies for ROA customers will disappear, industrial rates can be competitive, too. ROA customers may return to bundled service because of policy changes or naturally as capacity prices normalize. This would end the existing subsidy worth about $150 million. Here's our standard sensitivity table to permit you to evaluate our outlook. 
Here's our report card for 2015. We continue consistent, high-end earnings growth at $1.86 to $1.89 or up 5% to 7% from the high-end 2014 results. Operating cash flow should grow another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 and with no big bets. Last week, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and plan to stay in the 60% to 70% payout range. Importantly, our total price changes for electric and gas customers will reflect reductions of 3%. Yes, reductions of 3%, further increasing competitive value for our customers. Our balance sheet and CapEx measures are strong, and we're able to self-fund our organic CapEx programs with cost reductions and NOLs. 
Shifting to the longer term. Our future plan includes: healthy levels of investment; O&M cost reductions; modest sales growth; and a continuation of the 2008 energy law. Both earnings per share and the dividend should grow 5% to 7% each year. Our mix of capital spending during the last 10 years will shift and grow over the next 10 years. We'll be putting more capital investment into gas infrastructure and electric reliability as we continue investment in other important parts of the business. Capital investment grows 45% with no big bets. 
O&M costs, net of increases, continued to plummet with reductions of 2% in 2012, 3% in 2013, 3% in 2014, and we project another 3% in 2015. Compared with our last call, cost reductions are even bigger. In 2014 and 2015, O&M costs are down 3% each year instead of the 2% we previously reported. This progress reflects our conservative planning followed by better performance. Since 2006, we've reduced our cost by 7% through 2013, and with the acceleration, just discussed in 2014 and '15, we've got a fast start at accumulative cost reduction of 17% by 2018. 
Weather-normalized sales growth in 2014 was stronger than forecast. 2015 looks stronger than we thought as well, with electric industrial sales up 3% and overall sales up 1%. We still intend to plan 2016 to 2019 conservatively with our estimated industrial sales up 2% and overall sales up 0.5%. 
We plan to grow operating cash flow by another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 in 2015. That's up $500 million from 5 years ago, and we expect gross operating cash flow to rise to $2.4 billion by 2019, up another $500 million. Our operating cash flow levels already exceed peers. 
So here's a summary of what we have in our plan, with consistent earnings growth at 5% to 7% a year and good dividend growth that reflects the same. Since 2007, we've raised our dividend every year and on average by 25% a year. 
Now there are several areas, however, that are not reflected in our plan. These are meaningful upsides. Our capital spending could be substantially higher. Our sales growth and our cost reductions also could be better. In addition, our plan does not assume any changes to the energy laws such as: changes to retail open access, renewables, or energy efficiency standards. These may all result in large upsides. 
Our capital investment plans over the next 10 years are $15.5 billion, as we mentioned, up 45% from the last 10 years and there's an opportunity to increase that level by another 30%. We'll work to incorporate these opportunities without adding pressure to customer prices. 
Now here's a great example of that. One aspect that's still not included in our plan is new capacity investment. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either in response to policy or market changes, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills by $0.01. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at consumers. None of this is in our present plan. 
On top of capacity needed at consumers, the Ford GT or alias Ferrari in the garage is fired up. Capacity prices have begun to increase in the Midwest and there is an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvements of another $20 million to $40 million. We already have locked in $10 million, moving from $5 million to $15 million, with an opportunity to add further $20 million to $40 million and that is not yet in our plan. 
While we have an enviable organic growth plan, we have upsides: 30% more CapEx; new energy law improvements; higher sales; deeper cost reductions; and higher capacity prices. Our track record's pretty good. Our planned future is brighter than the past and that's before any of these likely upsides.
We're committed to high-end earnings and dividend growth, continuing our track record of a dozen years. We're committed to rapidly improving customer satisfaction with better value and performance. We are committed to our customers and to you, our investors. 
We thank you for your interest and your continuing support. We'd be delighted to take your questions. So Lori, would you please open up the lines?"

The Governor was pretty clear in the State of the State that he does want to move forward with energy policy. I think the situation that has occurred in the Upper Peninsula, as you referred to, really highlights the need to do something here in Michigan to take care of our customers with the Michigan companies, and not let MISO or the federal government step in to solve the issue that they were talking about before, so -- or what they did in the UP. So I think the timing of changing it is good. As far as the renewable energy, energy efficiency, that will all be part of the mix. I think it's important for us to look at the balanced portfolio, which includes what we're doing by reducing our coal fleet -- reducing the number of units in our coal fleet, increasing the gas. And I think the renewable energy standard will, one way or another, continue to grow in the State of Michigan, and I think that's good. I think it's good for our customers, but it will be a healthy debate with the Republicans in the House, Senate and the administration for the level that we choose. As far as the 50% in the 2008 law, I don't expect -- I mean, one of the things that we've been able to do, which is a tribute to the team, is build the renewable energy cheaper than we have purchasing it from other people. And that's very clear in what we've done over the past several years in the 2008 energy law. So if the intent of the law is to increase renewable energy and do it for our customers and do it in a cost-effective fashion, we ought to be able to do it all ourselves."

And when you follow that, and I assume most of the people followed that, Wisconsin Energy couldn't close down their plant because the federal government stepped in, to ensure reliability for the customers in the UP. The Michigan Governor and administration and others stepped in again, then, to prevent that from happening and have their own solution, which I think really determined that the Michigan solution for Michigan customers is best. And the one thing I still don't know is what the impact to the Upper Peninsula customers will be when this is all said and done. What we were able to determine before this deal was cut is that half of the customers up north would see a significant increase in rates on January 1, and that's been postponed. So the reality, the unintended consequence of full deregulation, which, in essence, is what happened in the Upper Peninsula because of the one company going to a different provider, really is playing out now in a way that is causing a lot of people to question this hybrid market that we have here in Michigan."

When you look at that, we -- on a bill basis, we continue -- the natural gas business, we'll start there, is very solid, because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the prices of natural ga",437,"Yes, I think it does. When you look at that, we -- on a bill basis, we continue -- the natural gas business, we'll start there, is very solid, because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the prices of natural gas coming down. What you see on the electric side is, that Tom highlighted a couple of his slides there, you see a couple of things. We can continue to grow capacity or grow our capacity, build it while customers come back from ROA. So retail open access customers return, we have $150 million of subsidies that go away, that could be put into paying for the additional capital that we have. Longer term, we have several long-term purchase power agreements that are higher-than-market. And I think one of the slides that Tom showed you there today is, that as we terminate those contracts or they sunset, that we're able to build capacity and save our customers' money. And the one thing, I think, everybody knows, but I'll just mention it again, one of the reasons we can continue our O&M and we don't -- O&M reductions, and we don't see an end to this, is we've addressed the legacy issues, which, I think, we're one of the few companies that have done that across the board including the union. Those are the benefits that keep giving to us year over, year-over-year as we turn over the workforce. The other issue too, is we invest capital. We invest capital for several reasons, but 2 areas that are important to emphasize here: we invest capital to reduce O&M; and we reduce (sic) capital to reduce our fuel costs. And there's several examples; going into all this I don't want to give you, but, you think about smart meters. We're installing smart meters, we're almost at 700,000 smart meters, we invest capital, improve customer satisfaction with the ability to read accurately, all the time, to help our distribution operation and to eliminate the O&M cost of reading the meters. And this is going to continue as we shut down the 7 coal plants. We have a larger workforce compared to getting the same amount of megawatts and capacity out of our gas plants with much fewer associated costs. So this future, I see as -- I think, Tom referred to it as bright. I see it as bright. We scratched the surface now, and now, we're starting to see some of the things that we did a few years ago pay dividends as we go forward in the future."

But through the working groups that led up to the legislature saying, ""Let's make these changes,"" the commission now has a process underway to go ahead and execute these changes. They will actually help our energy-intensive customers reduce their rates by 16%, overall, our industrial customers by 10%, and then the offset that comes on the residential side, we cover that. We cover that by skipping rate cases, by being more productive, and when you look at the Slide #17, about electric customer prices, that really shows how it works. That shows we're able to keep our residential bills well below the national average and put rate design in place among -- with all the things to do to take our industrial rates and bring them down close to or into the competitive area. So we anticipate there'll be lively discussion because when one goes up, one goes down, it's the way life is.

There's work in that area that will allow us to be more productive and efficient with what we're doing in O&M, there's $25 million to $30 million there. Our productivity across the board, higher quality improvements is another $30 million, here's a place where you're throwing money down the trash can: Our uncollectible accounts have gone up a little bit in the last year or 2 and no customer's interested in that and neither are you. So we're looking to get $20 million improvement in those uncollectible accounts. IT productivity, gets us another $15 million. Remember the Classic 7, we're getting prepared to go away so some of that cost begins to go away. There's about $7 million in there. Overhead, I'm too expensive, so 1 day they'll get rid of me, but not yet, but there's another $500 million of overhead that we have planned to go away this year. So there were a mixture of things in what I just went through that are a little richer, a little better, than what we have told you previously. So instead of being down 2%, you know we were already looking at all these items. We just didn't want to promise till we felt good about getting them.

So more people will look for capacity and there won't be a lot of it around, and so the opportunities for those prices to naturally go up will occur, we think, in '15 and maybe as late as in '16. So I see us being able to execute contracts on some of the surplus capacity at DIG that we just talked about, in that 500-megawatt-plus zone, in that period. So it may all occur in '16, but I get the sense that there may be a chance yet in '15 as people try to protect themselves appropriately."

What we do now is, we put it in the record that we're going to pay it in January and we don't pay in December, we pay it when it's due. Not late and not early. So that was a good chunk. We had some money out with other people on deposits that were due to come back to us in January and February, and our operational team was able to work with those folks and just say, ""Could we get that cash back?"" Since everything that was needed to be complied with was done in 2014. So we just have lots of things like that where everyday -- it's all part of continuous improvement. How do we make our promise to make our customers better off, treat our suppliers just perfectly, take care of our employees, do all those things and be more productive?

Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. 
I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the year before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then we'll close with Q&A. 
2014 adjusted earnings per share were $1.77, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. For 2015, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $1.85 to $1.86 per share. The top end remains the same at $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% off last year's actual performance. 
Last week, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%.
2014 was another successful year, both financially and operationally. The settlement of the gas rate case was constructive at $45 million with a 10.3% return on equity. We achieved our 10% renewable energy target 1 year ahead of schedule with the completion of the 111-megawatt Cross Winds Energy Park. 
In addition to improving customer satisfaction scores and moving towards a more competitive rate design, we invested a record $1.7 billion in the utility, in the areas of system reliability, environmental compliance, gas infrastructure and technology. These projects add value to our customers and deliver financial results for our shareholders. 
Our strategy is centered around breakthrough thinking over the long term. We begin by focusing on operational excellence and maintaining our first quartile cost performance. By the end of this year, we will have reduced O&M expense by $150 million since 2006, a 13% decrease on an absolute basis. We are able to grow organically with no big bets, through our transparent, 10-year, $15.5 billion capital investment plan. 
This year, we anticipate comprehensive energy policy in Michigan. The updated law as well as the predicted MISO capacity shortfall next year could provide future opportunities. Last week, we received an 18-month air permit extension for Thetford gas plant. This will provide us optionality to meet a capacity shortfall but it is not in our plan. 
We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers, and to first quartile for residential customers; a significant improvement over the past 4 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable financial results. 
The reelection of Governor Snyder and the reappointments of Senator Mike Nofs and House Representative Aric Nesbitt, as chairs of their respective energy committees, add stability in the political environment. The commission remains chaired by John Quackenbush and we anticipate the appointment of a new Commissioner to replace Greg White, who will be retiring midyear. We look forward to working with these respected leaders to advance energy policy.
Energy policy is a priority for the Governor, as he mentioned during his State of the State Address. He wants an energy policy that will be adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. The Governor also announced that he is creating a new agency to better coordinate energy policy in the state. He is expected to offer more details when he delivers an energy message in March. 
The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves towards less coal and more natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. We look forward to working with the Governor to support his goals.
Each year, we build our growth off prior year's actual result. Our model has continued to produce predictable results that build on the high end of performance. And the company's organic growth strategy continues to support the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. 
For 2015, we expect more breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety our top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our industry-leading cost performance puts us in a desirable position but we're not done. Again this year, we expect to take out more costs through increased productivity while maintaining a high level of employee engagement. 
By improving customer value and quality of service, we will continue to increase customer satisfaction. This year, we have an opportunity to work with policymakers on a new energy law that will secure Michigan's energy future for the next decade and more. All of this and deliver the predictable financial performance as we have in the past. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As J",1389,"Well, thanks, John. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. 
I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As John mentioned, the full year results at $1.77 a share, are up $0.11 or 7% from 2013. As you can see here in the left shaded circle, cost savings fully funded our capital investment in 2014. We avoided both gas and electric rate cases for 2014. We also put to work the substantial upside from better-than-planned cost performance and favorable weather in substantial O&M reinvestments. These approached $100 million in 2014 on top of a similar amount in 2013. 
This slide, which I suspect is familiar now to almost all of you, shows how on top of large planned cost reductions of $150 million in 2014, we further reduced our cost by $21 million. This and the colder-than-normal weather in the earlier part of the year provided room for substantial O&M reinvestment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and prefund parent debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk profile, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and to deliver consistent, high-end earnings per share growth.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2014. But please recall, we had cautioned earlier in the year that we might fall short of our cash flow target. We're delighted to report today that we are able to accomplish additional working capital improvements to achieve the operating cash flow objective of $1.45 billion.
Now looking ahead to 2015. You can see that the O&M reinvestments we made in 2014 already are bearing benefits. Much of our capital investment is self-funded by our own cost reductions, and half of the rate increases needed for 2015 already are in place. We've got a nice, fast start to the year. 
Earlier this month, we settled our 2015 gas rate case, our first since 2013, at $45 million. This included continuation of our return on equity at 10.3%. The 2015 electric rate case is well underway. It has 3 distinct features: first, it provides us with the opportunity to put the purchase of the new Jackson gas plant in a rate base when our customers need the capacity, and we're proud to do it at one of the lowest purchase prices for a gas plant ever paid; second, we'll be recovering the portion of our customer reinvestments -- or investments, that we have not already self-funded with cost reductions; and then last, this case includes a new rate design, which permits residential customers to stay fully competitive and allows industrial customers to become more competitive.
Electric residential bills are below the national average. Industrial rates are above the Midwest average and we have a solid plan to improve. Driven by our own cost reductions, improved rate design, and the prospect that subsidies for ROA customers will disappear, industrial rates can be competitive, too. ROA customers may return to bundled service because of policy changes or naturally as capacity prices normalize. This would end the existing subsidy worth about $150 million. Here's our standard sensitivity table to permit you to evaluate our outlook. 
Here's our report card for 2015. We continue consistent, high-end earnings growth at $1.86 to $1.89 or up 5% to 7% from the high-end 2014 results. Operating cash flow should grow another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 and with no big bets. Last week, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and plan to stay in the 60% to 70% payout range. Importantly, our total price changes for electric and gas customers will reflect reductions of 3%. Yes, reductions of 3%, further increasing competitive value for our customers. Our balance sheet and CapEx measures are strong, and we're able to self-fund our organic CapEx programs with cost reductions and NOLs. 
Shifting to the longer term. Our future plan includes: healthy levels of investment; O&M cost reductions; modest sales growth; and a continuation of the 2008 energy law. Both earnings per share and the dividend should grow 5% to 7% each year. Our mix of capital spending during the last 10 years will shift and grow over the next 10 years. We'll be putting more capital investment into gas infrastructure and electric reliability as we continue investment in other important parts of the business. Capital investment grows 45% with no big bets. 
O&M costs, net of increases, continued to plummet with reductions of 2% in 2012, 3% in 2013, 3% in 2014, and we project another 3% in 2015. Compared with our last call, cost reductions are even bigger. In 2014 and 2015, O&M costs are down 3% each year instead of the 2% we previously reported. This progress reflects our conservative planning followed by better performance. Since 2006, we've reduced our cost by 7% through 2013, and with the acceleration, just discussed in 2014 and '15, we've got a fast start at accumulative cost reduction of 17% by 2018. 
Weather-normalized sales growth in 2014 was stronger than forecast. 2015 looks stronger than we thought as well, with electric industrial sales up 3% and overall sales up 1%. We still intend to plan 2016 to 2019 conservatively with our estimated industrial sales up 2% and overall sales up 0.5%. 
We plan to grow operating cash flow by another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 in 2015. That's up $500 million from 5 years ago, and we expect gross operating cash flow to rise to $2.4 billion by 2019, up another $500 million. Our operating cash flow levels already exceed peers. 
So here's a summary of what we have in our plan, with consistent earnings growth at 5% to 7% a year and good dividend growth that reflects the same. Since 2007, we've raised our dividend every year and on average by 25% a year. 
Now there are several areas, however, that are not reflected in our plan. These are meaningful upsides. Our capital spending could be substantially higher. Our sales growth and our cost reductions also could be better. In addition, our plan does not assume any changes to the energy laws such as: changes to retail open access, renewables, or energy efficiency standards. These may all result in large upsides. 
Our capital investment plans over the next 10 years are $15.5 billion, as we mentioned, up 45% from the last 10 years and there's an opportunity to increase that level by another 30%. We'll work to incorporate these opportunities without adding pressure to customer prices. 
Now here's a great example of that. One aspect that's still not included in our plan is new capacity investment. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either in response to policy or market changes, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills by $0.01. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at consumers. None of this is in our present plan. 
On top of capacity needed at consumers, the Ford GT or alias Ferrari in the garage is fired up. Capacity prices have begun to increase in the Midwest and there is an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvements of another $20 million to $40 million. We already have locked in $10 million, moving from $5 million to $15 million, with an opportunity to add further $20 million to $40 million and that is not yet in our plan. 
While we have an enviable organic growth plan, we have upsides: 30% more CapEx; new energy law improvements; higher sales; deeper cost reductions; and higher capacity prices. Our track record's pretty good. Our planned future is brighter than the past and that's before any of these likely upsides.
We're committed to high-end earnings and dividend growth, continuing our track record of a dozen years. We're committed to rapidly improving customer satisfaction with better value and performance. We are committed to our customers and to you, our investors.

The Governor was pretty clear in the State of the State that he does want to move forward with energy policy. I think the situation that has occurred in the Upper Peninsula, as you referred to, really highlights the need to do something here in Michigan to take care of our customers with the Michigan companies, and not let MISO or the federal government step in to solve the issue that they were talking about before, so -- or what they did in the UP. So I think the timing of changing it is good. As far as the renewable energy, energy efficiency, that will all be part of the mix. I think it's important for us to look at the balanced portfolio, which includes what we're doing by reducing our coal fleet -- reducing the number of units in our coal fleet, increasing the gas. And I think the renewable energy standard will, one way or another, continue to grow in the State of Michigan, and I think that's good. I think it's good for our customers, but it will be a healthy debate with the Republicans in the House, Senate and the administration for the level that we choose. As far as the 50% in the 2008 law, I don't expect -- I mean, one of the things that we've been able to do, which is a tribute to the team, is build the renewable energy cheaper than we have purchasing it from other people. And that's very clear in what we've done over the past several years in the 2008 energy law. So if the intent of the law is to increase renewable energy and do it for our customers and do it in a cost-effective fashion, we ought to be able to do it all ourselves."

And when you follow that, and I assume most of the people followed that, Wisconsin Energy couldn't close down their plant because the federal government stepped in, to ensure reliability for the customers in the UP. The Michigan Governor and administration and others stepped in again, then, to prevent that from happening and have their own solution, which I think really determined that the Michigan solution for Michigan customers is best. And the one thing I still don't know is what the impact to the Upper Peninsula customers will be when this is all said and done. What we were able to determine before this deal was cut is that half of the customers up north would see a significant increase in rates on January 1, and that's been postponed. So the reality, the unintended consequence of full deregulation, which, in essence, is what happened in the Upper Peninsula because of the one company going to a different provider, really is playing out now in a way that is causing a lot of people to question this hybrid market that we have here in Michigan."

When you look at that, we -- on a bill basis, we continue -- the natural gas business, we'll start there, is very solid, because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the prices of natural gas coming down. What you see on the electric side is, that Tom highlighted a couple of his slides there, you see a couple of things. We can continue to grow capacity or grow our capacity, build it while customers come back from ROA. So retail open access customers return, we have $150 million of subsidies that go away, that could be put into paying for the additional capital that we have. Longer term, we have several long-term purchase power agreements that are higher-than-market. And I think one of the slides that Tom showed you there today is, that as we terminate those contracts or they sunset, that we're able to build capacity and save our customers' money. And the one thing, I think, everybody knows, but I'll just mention it again, one of the reasons we can continue our O&M and we don't -- O&M reductions, and we don't see an end to this, is we've addressed the legacy issues, which, I think, we're one of the few companies that have done that across the board including the union. Those are the benefits that keep giving to us year over, year-over-year as we turn over the workforce. The other issue too, is we invest capital. We invest capital for several reasons, but 2 areas that are important to emphasize here: we invest capital to reduce O&M; and we reduce [ph] capital to reduce our fuel costs. And there's several examples; going into all this I don't want to give you, but, you think about smart meters. We're installing smart meters, we're almost at 700,000 smart meters, we invest capital, improve customer satisfaction with the ability to read accurately, all the time, to help our distribution operation and to eliminate the O&M cost of reading the meters. And this is going to continue as we shut down the 7 coal plants. We have a larger workforce compared to getting the same amount of megawatts and capacity out of our gas plants with much fewer associated costs. So this future, I see as -- I think, Tom referred to it as bright. I see it as bright. We scratched the surface now, and now, we're starting to see some of the things that we did a few years ago pay dividends as we go forward in the future."

So you know that's well underway for both the major utilities in the state and there's a lot of different views, no question. But through the working groups that led up to the legislature saying, ""Let's make these changes,"" the commission now has a process underway to go ahead and execute these changes. They will actually help our energy-intensive customers reduce their rates by 16%, overall, our industrial customers by 10%, and then the offset that comes on the residential side, we cover that. We cover that by skipping rate cases, by being more productive, and when you look at the Slide #17, about electric customer prices, that really shows how it works. That shows we're able to keep our residential bills well below the national average and put rate design in place among -- with all the things to do to take our industrial rates and bring them down close to or into the competitive area. So we anticipate there'll be lively discussion because when one goes up, one goes down, it's the way life is. But we also expect that the policymakers and the regulators will look to do what's best and I suspect this will get through."

We're going to get another 3% out even though, everyone's aware, that most all companies have had to reflect the mortality tables. That cost us $35 million.

We don't say, ""Oh, that's terrible. We just -- we won't count the bad stuff."" We've fully offset that with better pull-top maintenance that we're doing. There's work in that area that will allow us to be more productive and efficient with what we're doing in O&M, there's $25 million to $30 million there. Our productivity across the board, higher quality improvements is another $30 million, here's a place where you're throwing money down the trash can: Our uncollectible accounts have gone up a little bit in the last year or 2 and no customer's interested in that and neither are you. So we're looking to get $20 million improvement in those uncollectible accounts. IT productivity, gets us another $15 million. Remember the Classic 7, we're getting prepared to go away so some of that cost begins to go away. There's about $7 million in there. Overhead, I'm too expensive, so 1 day they'll get rid of me, but not yet, but there's another $500 million of overhead that we have planned to go away this year. So there were a mixture of things in what I just went through that are a little richer, a little better, than what we have told you previously. So instead of being down 2%, you know we were already looking at all these items. We just didn't want to promise till we felt good about getting them. We're now at 3% and candidly, our internal numbers are a bigger reduction than that. But 3% is all we're willing to put on the table at this point for 2015."

And we had, had in the past, when the invoice would come in, some of our folks would -- and it was due, say, on January 10, they would just do 1 transaction, authorize that and we pay it in December. What we do now is, we put it in the record that we're going to pay it in January and we don't pay in December, we pay it when it's due. Not late and not early. So that was a good chunk. We had some money out with other people on deposits that were due to come back to us in January and February, and our operational team was able to work with those folks and just say, ""Could we get that cash back?"" Since everything that was needed to be complied with was done in 2014. So we just have lots of things like that where everyday -- it's all part of continuous improvement. How do we make our promise to make our customers better off, treat our suppliers just perfectly, take care of our employees, do all those things and be more productive?

Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call.
I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, provide an update on energy legislation and turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then as usual, close with Q&A.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.73, down $0.02 compared to last year, but up $0.04 or 7% on a weather-adjusted basis. In January, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.86 to $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow 5% to 7% of last year's actual results.
Our improved safety performance that began in the second half of last year continued through the first quarter. Compared to last year's first quarter, safety improved 58%. Our electric and gas systems continue to perform well. On the gas side, we had record sales in February. Capital investments in our electric system have resulted in improved reliability, the best in 10 years. Customer satisfaction has increased for both electric and gas business customers, and I'll talk more about these results in just a few minutes.
We also have a tentative 5-year agreement with our union, pending ratification. The mutually beneficial contract will support a high level of customer service and increased investment in the gas business.
Here, you can get a sense of how we are investing heavily in the gas business. We already have one of the largest natural gas systems in the country, and we plan to grow it to better serve our customers. Our 10-year plan calls for almost $6 billion of capital investment. We plan on replacing 800 miles of main, installing 9 new compressors and connecting 100,000 new customers. We have another 1 billion of opportunity to plan -- to grow this plan with more replacements, conversions and supplying natural gas generators.
We're able to continue our investment in the gas business, as falling natural gas prices create headroom and offset base rate increases. Over the last 6 years, our customers average bill has been cut by 1/3, falling from $3 to $2 a day, supported by natural gas fuel costs declining by 50%. We've been able to do this by cycling our gas storage fields and filling them with low-priced gas. 
As you look over the next 5 years, we see customers' prices staying relatively flat as new investment is offset by cost reductions and low natural gas prices. We are in a good position to invest in the gas business, maintain a high level of system performance and deliver increased reliability with lower prices to our customers.
Excuse me. We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers and to first quartile for residential customers, a significant improvement over the past 5 years. 
In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality of service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable and sustainable financial results.
As you know, Michigan is currently in the process of updating its energy law. The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves away from coal and more towards natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. His vision provides a constructive framework. 
The Michigan Senate and House are currently developing and debating legislation. The bills we have seen range from full regulation to an increase in the cap. The Governor stated that he would like to see the cap remain unchanged but would require 5 years of firm, forward capacity. He calls this fair choice. We look forward to working with the Governor and legislators on the energy policy and meeting Michigan's long-term energy needs.
The Governor has established 4 pillars to make Michigan's energy more adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. We support his vision and see many opportunities to achieve the state's energy goals. Our current energy efficiency program is working well and saving customers' money. A continuation of this program with revenue recovery and the existing incentive would make the 15% elimination of energy waste attainable. We fully support the integrated resource plan process that would allow the regulated utilities to determine the most economic capacity plan. 
By providing our customers with enablers, like our smart energy program, they will have more control over their energy usage and save money. Like the Governor, we want to see the elimination of subsidies to a fair choice policy, or full regulation without mandates, and begin to address the looming capacity shortfall facing the state.
MISO continues to predict the capacity shortfall in Zone 7, Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We are nearing this reality as coal plants are shut down and excess capacity is eliminated next year. In order to begin addressing this, we need a strong and supportive new energy law. The law will help the state meet its goals by eliminating waste, adding renewables and allowing the state to determine its energy future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to review the quarter."
257682,284892372,792905,"CMS Energy Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today.For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported an",1095,"Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today.
For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.02 below last year and $0.04 or 7% above last year on a weather-normalized basis. All business units were well ahead of their plans with company results $0.21 better than budget. 
As you can see here, the first quarter weather-normalized earnings up 7% and another cold winter O&M reinvestment is underway. Even with huge added cost of about $45 million or $0.08 a share associated with longer lives in the new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our continued cost reductions offset this and result in lower cost, down 3% from last year.
Our earnings per share forecast is already $0.17 ahead of plan. Please recall last year when we added substantial reliability work and still hit the top end of our 5% to 7% guidance. This year, weather has helped $0.14 and our cost reductions coupled with other improvements are $0.04 ahead of plan. Reinvestment underway includes increasing utility forest rework and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. This has the double benefit of pulling a heavy outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity in what will be a very tight year in 2016. In addition, we plan to increase DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts. This will add further to profitability next year.
Now while we're on the subject of our business at the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility, here's an update on both capacity and energy. The opportunity to increase capacity-related profits by $20 million to $40 million already has been enhanced. Just recently, we added a new 9-year capacity contract at a price that nearly doubled what we had assumed in our forecast. 
In addition, we're adding a new long-term 7-year energy contract for one of our 2 combined cycle units that could improve profits by more than $5 million a year. This is in progress.
The good news here is that we're beginning to realize benefits from the layering and strategy for capacity, as well as energy, enhancing the upside potential of DIG by as much as $25 million to $50 million a year with long-term contracts. Patients is paying off.
The outlook for our utility service territory in Michigan continues to be healthy. Whether it's building permits, GP growth, population growth or unemployment, we continue to outperform Michigan overall, as well as the U.S. average. 
First quarter sales were up nicely, continuing to support our outlook for full year sales increases of 3% for industrial customers and 1% overall. First quarter industrial sales are below the full year forecast, but that's as expected, reflecting the ramp-up at several customers during the year. In fact, the full year outlook is above 3%, but we prefer to keep the forecast at a conservative level.
Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are intended for our customers. Even without any upside, our capital investment over the next 10 years will be 45% greater than the last 10 years. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities can be included without increasing customer bills. There's a lot of work ahead, but none of it represents big bets that's put the company at risk.
Capital spending projects are progressing well. For example, we're 40% through our smart energy meter rollout and this has been a terrific project to reintroduce ourselves with every -- each and every one of our customers. Our environmental spending, primarily to address clean air standards, is 85% complete. We still have work ahead replacing gas mains and distribution systems, and we're 15% along the way. We've upgraded compression stations and we're halfway through the work to replace compressors to maximize efficiency at our gas storage fields. As an LBC, remember, we have the largest storage fields in the nation. And our project to upgrade our pump storage facility at Ludington, the fourth largest in the world, is nearly at the halfway spending mark. This project will provide a 16% improvement to capacity.
A lot of our capital investments enable us to reduce O&M cost, and these are down 10% since 2006, and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2019. As we switch from coal plants, which requires substantial number of people to run, the gas and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, will be reducing our O&M cost by over $30 million. By continuing our program to harden our pull tops, we'll reduce future storm-related damage and we'll capitalize rather than expense that work. This results in lower O&M costs spreading costs to our customers over a longer period of time. In addition, natural attrition, a variety of quality enhancing productivity actions and smart energy meters will help us reduce our cost substantially, and that's down 3% last year and 3% more this year.
Here's our sensitivity chart that we provide each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. We've added capital investment and O&M cost metrics to permit you to assess just how much these opportunities might be worth. 
And here's our report card for 2015. Obviously, with the Arctic blast, we're well ahead on earnings. We will, however, work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerated outages to enhance our outlook for 2016. You'll note that we upgraded where ourselves with green checks and all metrics and a double check on earnings per share growth. While we're not increasing our guidance beyond 5% to 7%, I suspect that our performance so far this year, coupled with our track record over the last decade, probably gives you a pretty good sense that we feel pretty comfortable.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We're now in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time.

I mean, the first choice or the fair choice aspect, what the Governor is looking for is that he doesn't want subsidies from our existing utility customers to pay for the capacity that's used as a backup for the retail open access customers. So little too soon to tell on that. But basically, if it works the we he's thinking, what would happen is they would have to show the firm capacity 5 years out so that we would not be responsible for supplying that capacity. And based on that, it depends what the market's going to be. I think the numbers we have today, we've got about 300 customers or about 0.2% of our customers that are on retail open access. Hard for me to assess what their contracts are like or what the markets like. But as you saw on some of the capacity auction results from the MISO market, some of the deregulated states are a little bit higher than the regulated states. So it would be up to them to determine the best deal that they have."

And let be more specific. As you've seen gas prices drop substantially over the past 5 years, if we did an integrated resource plan 10 years ago, gas probably wouldn't be a preferred option. However, with gas prices the way they are, today, they are preferred option. So you want that, as the Governor call sip adaptability with changing technologies, changing commodity prices, to go back in in the interim of that long-term plan to be able to adjust the plan, get an agreement with the regulators, and move forward with that type of generation. And then your point, that's going also to include renewable optimization at all that. The integrated resource plan will cover the spectrum, not just the supply aspect, but how we get the supply, what fuel source and how we do energy optimization. And the thing I'd like about it is that if we do that, it also show the most economic plan, we'll put forth the most economic plan for our customers."

Three, it reduces O&M cost. And forth, if there's an environmental commitment that we've made to improve the environment, whether it's driven through EPA state laws or own initiatives, we do that too. So the customers by us investing capital, get a better environment, a better bill and better reliability. And that's really what we strive for it. In the 5-year plan that we have today, with the capital investment we have, we can still keep customer rates below the rate of inflation, the base rate increase below the rate of inflation, and that's on the electric side. On the gas side, that also holds true, but as I mentioned earlier, with a low gas prices, customers are paying bills at the same rate that they did in 2001.

I think I stated, we got $1 billion on top of that if we choose to. But right now, that seems like the right level. The one thing that we're a little pushed against is we hired about 625 people in the gas business over the past 3 years. And we're growing those people. I think it's going to be a competitive advantage for us to have people that can install pipe, weld pipe, going forward in the future. So as those people develop, we need able to put little more capital into it. But gas business is that it's not just plug and play. It takes a lot of employees to get that done. And what you'll find in some areas, contractors are getting a little short now because of the influx in capital. So we made the decision a few years ago to move ahead with our own workforce, worked with our union. And we added 625 people to do that, which will position us well in the future. And so if there was going to increase, think of it incrementally."

Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, provide an update on energy legislation and turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then as usual, close with Q&A.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.73, down $0.02 compared to last year, but up $0.04 or 7% on a weather-adjusted basis. In January, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.86 to $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow 5% to 7% off last year's actual results.
Our improved safety performance that began in the second half of last year continued through the first quarter. Compared to last year's first quarter, safety improved 58%. Our electric and gas systems continue to perform well. On the gas side, we had record sales in February. Capital investments in our electric system have resulted in improved reliability, the best in 10 years. Customer satisfaction has increased for both electric and gas business customers, and I'll talk more about these results in just a few minutes.
We also have a tentative 5-year agreement with our union, pending ratification. The mutually beneficial contract will support a high level of customer service and increased investment in the gas business.
Here, you can get a sense of how we are investing heavily in the gas business. We already have one of the largest natural gas systems in the country, and we plan to grow it to better serve our customers. Our 10-year plan calls for almost $6 billion of capital investment. We plan on replacing 800 miles of main, installing 9 new compressors and connecting 100,000 new customers. We have another $1 billion of opportunity to plan -- to grow this plan with more replacements, conversions and supplying natural gas generators. We're able to continue our investment in the gas business as falling natural gas prices create headroom and offset base rate increases. Over the last 6 years, our customers' average bill has been cut by 1/3, falling from $3 to $2 a day, supported by natural gas fuel costs declining by 50%. We've been able to do this by cycling our gas storage fields and filling them with low-priced gas. As you look over the next 5 years, we see customers' prices staying relatively flat as new investment is offset by cost reductions and low natural gas prices. We are in a good position to invest in the gas business, maintain a high level of system performance and deliver increased reliability with lower prices to our customers.
We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers and to first quartile for residential customers, a significant improvement over the past 5 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality of service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable and sustainable financial results.
As you know, Michigan is currently in the process of updating its energy law. The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves away from coal and more towards natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. His vision provides a constructive framework. The Michigan Senate and House are currently developing and debating legislation. The bills we have seen range from full regulation to an increase in the cap. The Governor stated that he would like to see the cap remain unchanged, but would require 5 years of firm, forward capacity. He calls this fair choice. We look forward to working with the Governor and legislators on the energy policy and meeting Michigan's long-term energy needs.
The Governor has established 4 pillars to make Michigan's energy more adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. We support his vision and see many opportunities to achieve the state's energy goals. Our current energy efficiency program is working well and saving customers' money. A continuation of this program with revenue recovery and the existing incentive would make the 15% elimination of energy waste attainable. We fully support the integrated resource plan process that would allow the regulated utilities to determine the most economic capacity plan. 
By providing our customers with enablers, like our Smart Energy program, they will have more control over their energy usage and save money. Like the Governor, we want to see the elimination of subsidies through a fair choice policy or full regulation without mandates and begin to address the looming capacity shortfall facing the state. 
MISO continues to predict the capacity shortfall in Zone 7, Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We are nearing this reality as coal plants are shut down and excess capacity is eliminated next year. In order to begin addressing this, we need a strong and supportive new energy law. The law will help the state meet its goals by eliminating waste, adding renewables and allowing the state to determine its energy future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to review the quarter."

As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today.For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported an",1096,"Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today.
For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.02 below last year and $0.04 or 7% above last year on a weather-normalized basis. All business units were well ahead of their plans, with company results $0.21 better than budget. 
As you can see here, the first quarter weather-normalized earnings up 7% and another cold winter O&M reinvestment is underway. Even with huge added cost of about $45 million or $0.08 a share associated with longer lives in the new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our continued cost reductions offset this and result in lower cost, down 3% from last year. Our earnings per share forecast is already $0.17 ahead of plan. Please recall last year when we added substantial reliability work and still hit the top end of our 5% to 7% guidance. This year, weather has helped $0.14, and our cost reductions, coupled with other improvements, are $0.04 ahead of plan. 
Reinvestment underway includes increasing utility forestry work and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. This has the double benefit of pulling a heavy outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity in what will be a very tight year in 2016. In addition, we plan to increase DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts. This will add further to profitability next year.
Now while we're on the subject of our business at the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility, here's an update on both capacity and energy. The opportunity to increase capacity-related profits by $20 million to $40 million already has been enhanced. Just recently, we added a new 9-year capacity contract at a price that nearly doubled what we had assumed in our forecast. In addition, we're adding a new long-term 7-year energy contract for one of our 2 combined cycle units that could improve profits by more than $5 million a year. This is in progress. The good news here is that we're beginning to realize benefits from the layering and strategy for capacity as well as energy, enhancing the upside potential of DIG by as much as $25 million to $50 million a year with long-term contracts. Patience is paying off.
The outlook for our utility service territory in Michigan continues to be healthy. Whether it's building permits, GP growth, population growth or unemployment, we continue to outperform Michigan overall as well as the U.S. average. First quarter sales were up nicely, continuing to support our outlook for full year sales increases of 3% for industrial customers and 1% overall. First quarter industrial sales are below the full year forecast, but that's as expected, reflecting a ramp-up at several customers during the year. In fact, the full year outlook is above 3%, but we prefer to keep the forecast at a conservative level.
Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are intended for our customers. Even without any upside, our capital investment over the next 10 years will be 45% greater than the last 10 years. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities can be included without increasing customer bills. There's a lot of work ahead, but none of it represents big bets, bets that put the company at risk.
Capital spending projects are progressing well. For example, we're 40% through our Smart Energy meter rollout, and this has been a terrific project to reintroduce ourselves with every -- each and every one of our customers. Our environmental spending, primarily to address clean air standards, is 85% complete. We still have work ahead replacing gas mains and distribution systems, and we're 15% along the way. We've upgraded compressor stations, and we're halfway through the work to replace compressors to maximize efficiency at our gas storage fields. As an LDC, remember, we have the largest storage fields in the nation. And our project to upgrade our pump storage facility at Ludington, the fourth largest in the world, is nearly at the halfway spending mark. This project will provide a 16% improvement to capacity.
A lot of our capital investment enables us to reduce O&M cost, and these are down 10% since 2006 and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2019. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to run, to gas and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we'll be reducing our O&M cost by over $30 million. By continuing our program to harden our pull tops, we'll reduce future storm-related damage and will capitalize rather than expense that work. This results in lower O&M costs spreading cost to our customers over a longer period of time. In addition, natural attrition, a variety of quality-enhancing productivity actions and Smart Energy meters will help us reduce our cost substantially, and that's down 3% last year and 3% more this year.
Here's our sensitivity chart that we provide each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. We've added capital investment and O&M cost metrics to permit you to assess just how much these opportunities might be worth. 
And here's our report card for 2015. Obviously, with the Arctic blast, we're well ahead on earnings. We will, however, work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerated outages to enhance our outlook for 2016. You'll note that we've graded where ourselves with green checks on all metrics and a double check on earnings per share growth. While we're not increasing our guidance beyond 5% to 7%, I suspect that our performance so far this year, coupled with our track record over the last decade, probably gives you a pretty good sense that we feel pretty comfortable.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We're now in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time.
Thank you very much for your interest and your time today. We look forward to taking your questions, so operator, would you please open the line for questions?"

I mean, the first choice or the fair choice aspect, what the Governor is looking for is that he doesn't want subsidies from our existing utility customers to pay for the capacity that's used as a backup for the retail open access customers. So a little too soon to tell on that. But basically, if it works the we he's thinking, what would happen is they would have to show the firm capacity 5 years out so that we would not be responsible for supplying that capacity. And based on that, it depends what the market's going to be. I think the numbers we have today, we've got about 300 customers or about 0.2% of our customers that are on retail open access. It's hard for me to assess what their contracts are like or what the market's like. But as you saw on some of the capacity auction results from the MISO market, some of the deregulated states are a little bit higher than the regulated states. So it would be up to them to determine the best deal that they have."

And I think that's going to be dependent primarily on a nonrelated topic, which is a ballot proposal to improve the roads in Michigan. If that doesn't get passed, I think the legislators are going to be more focused on the budget than energy for maybe this summer. So expect it to be done by year-end, but it may not be done by the middle of the year. And as far as where the bills are, they're pretty much across the board. The House is full regulation. The bill that's been set in the House is full regulation. The Senate has 2 bills, one is to increase the cap and one is to ensure that customers who are on retail open access have a onetime shot at staying -- going to the market and they can't come back. So when you look at how that is and what I'd mentioned earlier about where the Governor is, it looks like the top end of this or the worst-case scenario would be 10% with a firm capacity position that they'd have to disclose to a regulator going forward. And maybe the best case for us would be full regulation. But I don't think it would happen all at once. And maybe Julien's question, and kind of related to that, is that I think you're going to -- we would see this come back. Tom mentioned we saw a big jump the last time we went through this. But it's going to take time.

Rather than mandate a certain percent, I think where they would go is more putting to an IRP -- putting it towards more of an integrated resource plan that maybe long in tenure with the ability to seek approval on a multiyear basis for changes that may occur. And let me be more specific. As you've seen gas prices drop substantially over the past 5 years. If we did an integrated resource plan 10 years ago, gas probably wouldn't be a preferred option. However, with gas prices the way they are, today, you -- they are a preferred option. So you want that, as the Governor calls, adaptability with changing technologies, changing commodity prices, to go back in, in the interim of that long-term plan to be able to adjust the plan, get an agreement with the regulators and move forward with that type of generation. And Dan, to your point, that's also going to include renewable energy, energy optimization and all that. The integrated resource plan will cover the spectrum, not just the supply aspect, but how we get the supply, what fuel source and how we do energy optimization. And the thing I like about it is that if we do that, it'd also show the most economic plan. We'll put forth the most economic plan for our customers."

Yes, I mean, one of the things that's I think very important to understand about our capital investment plan is that we invest capital for a couple of reasons. And if we don't achieve those reasons, we don't invest a capital. One, we need to make sure that it provides value to our customers. Two, it ensures that we reduce fuel cost. Three, it reduces O&M cost. And fourth, if there's an environmental commitment that we'd made to improve the environment, whether it's driven through EPA state laws or our own initiatives, we do that, too. So the customers, by us investing capital, get a better environment, a better bill and better reliability. And that's really what we strive for. In the 5-year plan that we have today, with the capital investment we have, we can still keep customer rates below the rate of inflation, the base rate increase below the rate of inflation, and that's on the electric side. On the gas side, that also holds true. But as I mentioned earlier, with the low gas prices, customers are paying bills the same rate that they did in 2001. So we have a lot of headroom. Fuel is in our favor in most cases here. And where it isn't in our favor because we're making investments on the electric side, we're seeing the results in reliability, results in customer satisfaction. And the results, which I think are unique for us compared to others, is the reduction in O&M cost. And we see that happening. Tom showed you the one chart. We're down last 8 years 10%. And the next 5 years, we expect to be down 7%. And that's on an absolute basis. That includes inflation, includes the legacy cost that we have.

And you know that fits pretty well with economics that we're seeing, so more cement and the like. We're seeing a little more in the silicon side, so it's a little more high tech that's coming in. And the aluminum side of the industry. All of these industries have told us they need more. And we'll be providing that, and we're already beginning to see that tick up just a little bit. So our forecast is pushing us to say it's going to be higher than 3% industrial growth, but we don't want us -- you know us. We don't want to say that until we see it actually come to do."

Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, provide an update on energy legislation and turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then as usual, close with Q&A.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.73, down $0.02 compared to last year, but up $0.04 or 7% on a weather-adjusted basis. In January, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.86 to $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow 5% to 7% off last year's actual results.
Our improved safety performance that began in the second half of last year continued through the first quarter. Compared to last year's first quarter, safety improved 58%. Our electric and gas systems continue to perform well. On the gas side, we had record sales in February. Capital investments in our electric system have resulted in improved reliability, the best in 10 years. Customer satisfaction has increased for both electric and gas business customers, and I'll talk more about these results in just a few minutes.
We also have a tentative 5-year agreement with our union, pending ratification. The mutually beneficial contract will support a high level of customer service and increased investment in the gas business.
Here, you can get a sense of how we are investing heavily in the gas business. We already have one of the largest natural gas systems in the country, and we plan to grow it to better serve our customers. Our 10-year plan calls for almost $6 billion of capital investment. We plan on replacing 800 miles of main, installing 9 new compressors and connecting 100,000 new customers. We have another $1 billion of opportunity to plan -- to grow this plan with more replacements, conversions and supplying natural gas generators. We're able to continue our investment in the gas business as falling natural gas prices create headroom and offset base rate increases. Over the last 6 years, our customers' average bill has been cut by 1/3, falling from $3 to $2 a day, supported by natural gas fuel costs declining by 50%. We've been able to do this by cycling our gas storage fields and filling them with low-priced gas. As you look over the next 5 years, we see customers' prices staying relatively flat as new investment is offset by cost reductions and low natural gas prices. We are in a good position to invest in the gas business, maintain a high level of system performance and deliver increased reliability with lower prices to our customers.
We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers and to first quartile for residential customers, a significant improvement over the past 5 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality of service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable and sustainable financial results.
As you know, Michigan is currently in the process of updating its energy law. The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves away from coal and more towards natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. His vision provides a constructive framework. The Michigan Senate and House are currently developing and debating legislation. The bills we have seen range from full regulation to an increase in the cap. The Governor stated that he would like to see the cap remain unchanged, but would require 5 years of firm, forward capacity. He calls this fair choice. We look forward to working with the Governor and legislators on the energy policy and meeting Michigan's long-term energy needs.
The Governor has established 4 pillars to make Michigan's energy more adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. We support his vision and see many opportunities to achieve the state's energy goals. Our current energy efficiency program is working well and saving customers money. A continuation of this program with revenue recovery and the existing incentive would make the 15% elimination of energy waste attainable. We fully support the integrated resource plan process that would allow the regulated utilities to determine the most economic capacity plan. 
By providing our customers with enablers, like our Smart Energy program, they will have more control over their energy usage and save money. Like the Governor, we want to see the elimination of subsidies through a fair choice policy or full regulation without mandates and begin to address the looming capacity shortfall facing the state. 
MISO continues to predict the capacity shortfall in Zone 7, Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We are nearing this reality as coal plants are shut down and excess capacity is eliminated next year. In order to begin addressing this, we need a strong and supportive new energy law. The law will help the state meet its goals by eliminating waste, adding renewables and allowing the state to determine its energy future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to review the quarter."
257682,284892372,793256,"CMS Energy Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today.For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported an",1095,"Thanks, John, and thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today.
For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.02 below last year and $0.04 or 7% above last year on a weather-normalized basis. All business units were well ahead of their plans, with company results $0.21 better than budget. 
As you can see here, the first quarter weather-normalized earnings up 7% and another cold winter, O&M reinvestment is underway. Even with huge added cost of about $45 million or $0.08 a share associated with longer lives in the new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our continued cost reductions offset this and result in lower cost, down 3% from last year. Our earnings per share forecast is already $0.17 ahead of plan. Please recall last year when we added substantial reliability work and still hit the top end of our 5% to 7% guidance. This year, weather has helped $0.14, and our cost reductions, coupled with other improvements, are $0.04 ahead of plan. 
Reinvestment underway includes increasing utility forestry work and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. This has the double benefit of pulling a heavy outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity in what will be a very tight year in 2016. In addition, we plan to increase DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts. This will add further to profitability next year.
Now while we're on the subject of our business at the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility, here's an update on both capacity and energy. The opportunity to increase capacity-related profits by $20 million to $40 million already has been enhanced. Just recently, we added a new 9-year capacity contract at a price that nearly doubled what we had assumed in our forecast. In addition, we're adding a new long-term 7-year energy contract for 1 of our 2 combined cycle units that could improve profits by more than $5 million a year. This is in progress. The good news here is that we're beginning to realize benefits from the layering and strategy for capacity as well as energy, enhancing the upside potential at DIG by as much as $25 million to $50 million a year with long-term contracts. Patience is paying off.
The outlook for our utility service territory in Michigan continues to be healthy. Whether it's building permits, GDP growth, population growth or unemployment, we continue to outperform Michigan overall as well as the U.S. average. First quarter sales were up nicely, continuing to support our outlook for full year sales increases of 3% for industrial customers and 1% overall. First quarter industrial sales are below the full year forecast, but that's as expected, reflecting a ramp-up at several customers during the year. In fact, the full year outlook is above 3%, but we prefer to keep the forecast at a conservative level.
Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are intended for our customers. Even without any upside, our capital investment over the next 10 years will be 45% greater than the last 10 years. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities can be included without increasing customer bills. There's a lot of work ahead, but none of it represents big bets, bets that put the company at risk.
Capital spending projects are progressing well. For example, we're 40% through our Smart Energy meter rollout, and this has been a terrific project to reintroduce ourselves with every -- each and every one of our customers. Our environmental spending, primarily to address clean air standards, is 85% complete. We still have work ahead replacing gas mains and distribution systems, and we're 15% along the way. We've upgraded compressor stations, and we're halfway through the work to replace compressors to maximize efficiency at our gas storage fields. As an LDC, remember, we have the largest storage fields in the nation. And our project to upgrade our pump storage facility at Ludington, the fourth largest in the world, is nearly at the halfway spending mark. This project will provide a 16% improvement to capacity.
A lot of our capital investment enables us to reduce O&M cost, and these are down 10% since 2006 and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2019. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to run, to gas and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we'll be reducing our O&M cost by over $30 million. By continuing our program to harden our pull tops, we'll reduce future storm-related damage and will capitalize rather than expense that work. This results in lower O&M costs spreading cost to our customers over a longer period of time. In addition, natural attrition, a variety of quality-enhancing productivity actions and Smart Energy meters will help us reduce our cost substantially, and that's down 3% last year and 3% more this year.
Here's our sensitivity chart that we provide each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. We've added capital investment and O&M cost metrics to permit you to assess just how much these opportunities might be worth. 
And here's our report card for 2015. Obviously, with the Arctic blast, we're well ahead on earnings. We will, however, work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerated outages to enhance our outlook for 2016. You'll note that we've graded ourselves with green checks on all metrics and a double check on earnings per share growth. While we're not increasing our guidance beyond 5% to 7%, I suspect that our performance so far this year, coupled with our track record over the last decade, probably gives you a pretty good sense that we feel pretty comfortable.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We're now in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time.
Thank you very much for your interest and your time today. We look forward to taking your questions, so operator, would you please open the line for questions?"

I mean, the first choice or the fair choice aspect, what the Governor is looking for, is that he doesn't want subsidies from our existing utility customers to pay for the capacity that's used as a backup for the retail open access customers. So a little too soon to tell on that. But basically, if it works the way he's thinking, what would happen is they would have to show the firm capacity 5 years out so that we would not be responsible for supplying that capacity. And based on that, it depends what the market's going to be. I think the numbers we have today, we've got about 300 customers or about 0.2% of our customers that are on retail open access. It's hard for me to assess what their contracts are like or what the market's like. But as you saw on some of the capacity auction results from the MISO market, some of the deregulated states are a little bit higher than the regulated states. So it would be up to them to determine the best deal that they have."

And I think that's going to be dependent primarily on a nonrelated topic, which is a ballot proposal to improve the roads in Michigan. If that doesn't get passed, I think the legislators are going to be more focused on the budget than energy for maybe this summer. So expect it to be done by year-end, but it may not be done by the middle of the year. And as far as where the bills are, they're pretty much across the board. The House is full regulation. The bill that's been set in the House is full regulation. The Senate has 2 bills, one is to increase the cap and one is to ensure that customers who are on retail open access have a onetime shot at staying -- going to the market and they can't come back. So when you look at how that is and what I'd mentioned earlier about where the Governor is, it looks like the top end of this or the worst-case scenario would be 10% with a firm capacity position that they'd have to disclose to a regulator going forward. And maybe the best case for us would be full regulation. But I don't think it would happen all at once. And maybe Julien's question, and kind of related to that, is that I think you're going to -- we would see this come back. Tom mentioned we saw a big jump the last time we went through this. But it's going to take time. I don't think it's going to be all at once because I believe, and I don't have the data for this, but the contracts that the third parties enter into with our customers, retail open access, probably have a duration of a year or 2.

However, with gas prices the way they are today, you -- they are a preferred option. So you want that, as the Governor calls, adaptability, with changing technologies, changing commodity prices to go back in, in the interim of that long-term plan to be able to adjust the plan, get an agreement with the regulators and move forward with that type of generation. And Dan, to your point, that's also going to include renewable energy, energy optimization and all that. The integrated resource plan will cover the spectrum, not just the supply aspect, but how we get the supply, what fuel source and how we do energy optimization.

Yes, I mean, one of the things that's I think very important to understand about our capital investment plan is that we invest capital for a couple of reasons. And if we don't achieve those reasons, we don't invest the capital. One, we need to make sure that it provides value to our customers. Two, it ensures that we reduce fuel cost. Three, it reduces O&M cost. And fourth, if there's an environmental commitment that we'd made to improve the environment, whether it's driven through EPA state laws or our own initiatives, we do that, too. So the customers, by us investing capital, get a better environment, a better bill and better reliability. And that's really what we strive for. In the 5-year plan that we have today, with the capital investment we have, we can still keep customer rates below the rate of inflation, the base rate increase below the rate of inflation, and that's on the electric side. On the gas side, that also holds true. But as I mentioned earlier, with the low gas prices, customers are paying bills the same rate that they did in 2001. So we have a lot of headroom. Fuel is in our favor in most cases here. And where it isn't in our favor because we're making investments on the electric side, we're seeing the results in reliability, results in customer satisfaction. And the results, which I think are unique for us compared to others, is the reduction in O&M cost. And we see that happening. Tom showed you the one chart. We're down last 8 years 10%. And the next 5 years, we expect to be down 7%. And that's on an absolute basis. That includes inflation, includes the legacy cost that we have. So we feel very comfortable that we invest the right amount of capital to do things that I just mentioned and keeping the bills affordable."

It takes a lot of employees to get that done. And what you'll find in some areas, contractors are getting a little short now because of the influx in capital.

As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. And John sends his regrets that he can't join us today. He's recovering from a medical procedure and we look forward to his return in a few weeks. I know he'll miss fueling your questions today. Then we'll begin the call with an overview of the quarter and provide an update on a legislative process before turning to more detail on the gas business, the first half and our growth model. And then we'll close with Q&A. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.98, down $0.07 from last year, but up $0.03 on a weather adjusted basis, or $0.13 ahead of plan. Today, we're reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.86 to $1.89 and as you know, this reflects real growth of 5% to 7% off last year's actual results. We filed our gas rate case last week for $85 million. Like our previous cases, it's small and primarily driven by capital investment. Even with this rate case, we expect total customer bills to decrease in 2016 due to lower gas commodity prices. Last month, we self-implemented our electric rate case at $110 million. Now we expect an order for this case in December, which would mark 2.5 years since the last order. Our predictable growth has continued over that time and we've self-initiated many cost reductions to keep prices low for our customers.
Here, you can see the impact of our actions along with constructive regulatory environment. Our industrial rates are at a competitive level that's attracting new business to the state. Rates could be improved further with changes to ROA policy, creating a competitive advantage for Michigan's business in the Midwest and in the country. As we've improved industrial rates, residential bills have remained low at about $3 a day.
Recently, we committed to do more in Michigan and help grow businesses. Our spending on in-state goods and services will be $1 billion per year over the next 5 years. By helping to make Michigan a competitive states in which to do business, we are seeing growth. In Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory, housing, GDP, population growth and unemployment are all better today than Michigan and as a whole in the U.S. Overall, Michigan is moving toward becoming a top 10 state, and Grand Rapids is leading the way.
Michigan's energy law update can help to drive this growth. Bills are now in committees with the house and senate. Recently, senate committee Chairman, Mike Knobbs introduced a comprehensive bill after considerable research and debate. The senator's bill proposes to keep the ROA cap, however, the bill stipulates stringent requirements for both ROA suppliers and customers. In order to protect all customers from reliability and price volatility, the supplier would be required to procure a minimum of 3 years of capacity, and ROA customers who decide to stay with alternative suppliers will be required to provide a 3-year notice prior to returning the bundled utility service. Once a customer returns from ROA, they're no longer eligible to switch back. These policy leaders are broadly in agreement with the integrated resources plan process, which will give the state the flexibility it needs among many things, to enable investment in needed new generation and comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The IRP would replace the existing certificate of necessity process with a more comprehensive, longer-term decision-making process. The IRP would provide us with the assurance of recovery and allow us to plan capacity resources for a decade or more. This transparent process could include new gas capacity, renewables and efficiency programs. Now on the regulatory front, I'm pleased to highlight the governor's announcement yesterday of the appointment of Norm Starry, as the new Public Service Commissioner. He has a long track record of public and private service in the utility sector and public policy space. We look forward to working with him. 
We continue to look at and evaluate new investment opportunities that could increase the capital spending in our 10-year plan. When we look at these opportunities, we evaluate each 1 by asking them, does it add customer value? Does it reduce O&M cost? Does it help balance our fuel sources? And/or, is it mandated by state or federal regulations? And none of our investments in the plan or those identified as opportunities are big bets. Our gas business is one of the larger distribution systems in the country. This scale provides many investment opportunities for additional growth. We've been upgrading our compressor stations, installing new transmission lines and replacing aging infrastructure. We could do more and we could accelerate the pace.
Our plan calls for doubling gas investment over the next 10 years. This brings our investment mix to over 1/3 gas. Our customers benefit from the safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness of the gas plan. If fuel costs remain low, additional headroom will allow us to make these investments without impairing price. On average, our gas customers spend about $2 a day. That's equal to their bill in 2004. Now here's a little more detail on our results. For the second quarter, our earnings were $0.25 a share on both our reported and on adjusted basis. This is $0.05 below last year or $0.01 on a weather normalized basis. Weather in June was the mildest in 15 years. Cooling days were 50% lower than last year. Economic sales also reflect as 1 substantial low-margin customer came through a temporary supply interruption. For the first half of the year, our results were $0.98 or $0.86 on a weather normalized basis. That's $0.03 better than 2014 and at the midyear checkpoint, we are $0.13 a share or 15% better than our plan. We have lots of room to move.
As you can see here, with first half weather normalized earnings, up $0.03, we're positioned well. Even with $0.05 of cost in the second half associated with new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our cost reductions of $0.12 more than offset this. For the full year, costs are down about 3% and new rates already have been implemented. At midyear, our earnings per share is $0.13 ahead of plan and like last year and many of the years and the decade prior to that, we added substantial customer reliability work and still plan to hit our 5% to 7% guidance. O&M reinvestment of $18 million is underway, including more forestry work at the utility and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 into this year. The DIG outage pull ahead accomplishes a double benefit of accelerating the DIG outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it, and bringing up capacity in what will be a very tight market in 2016. In addition, we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts, and these reinvestments could add $20 million to profitability next year.
From time to time, some of you ask us, how we accomplish consistent earnings growth year in and year out, and how we do it without raising customer rates above inflation? As you know, we have a robust capital investment program and a substantial opportunity to increase it. However, we build our investment plan starting with customer rates growing no faster than inflation, and here's how we do that. Our O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, conservatively forecast sales growth of about 0.5% a year, avoidance of block equity dilution worth about 1 point, and other self funds, 5 points of investment. This permits earnings to grow 5% to 7% and customer rate impacts stay below inflation. Here's our capital investment program for the next 10 years, investment in our gas business grows substantially. Investment in our electric business continues to grow too, but at slower pace. And please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. Even without any upsides, our capital investment program over the next 10 years will be 45% larger than the last 10 years. As a percent of market cap, EMS investment was 10% over the last 10 years, it's 16% over the next 10. This exceeds peers. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. A lot of the capital investment we've put in place enables us to reduce O&M cost. These are down 10% since 2006 and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2018. There's no magic to this cost reduction program. It's simple, natural changes in our business like coal to gas generation and pole top hardening make the difference. Here's more detail around cost reduction actions, down 6% in 2 years. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to operate, the cash generation and windfarms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we'll be able to reduce our O&M by $35 million. By continuing our program to harden our pole tops, we reduced future storm-related damage and we capitalize rather than expense that work. These are just a couple of examples of how we reduced our cost 3% last year and are in the middle of a program to do another 3% this year. Since 2006 through 2014, ours is the only utility to reduce its costs, down almost 3% a year. We forecast reduction, perhaps conservatively at 2% a year between 2014 and 2018. The outlook for the economy in our utility service territory continues to be bright. As you can see here, many companies from a variety of sectors have announced new factories and businesses. This will add new growth of almost 3%. Despite this, we continued to plan conservatively, including overall sales growth at about 1.5% over the next 5 years and industrial growth of about 2%. While this is another opportunity in our model to minimize customer rate growth, there may be a little upside.
One more element of the self-funding model that promotes robust rate base and earnings growth without allowing customer rates to grow faster than inflation, is the benefit from a large stockpile of NOLs. Typically, a utility would lose about 1% of its earnings growth through a dilution associated with new equity to fund growth. In our case, we're fortunate to be able to invest our cash in utility growth rather than taxes avoiding a full point of dilution.
So the model is simple and perhaps it's a little unique. We start our planning by keeping nominal customer rate growth below inflation or in other words, we provide real rate reductions. With cost reductions, modest sales growth, and no block equity dilution and shrinking surcharges, we're able to grow rate base by 5% to 7% and with substantial opportunity to do more. Many of our capital investment opportunities not yet in our plan, can be accomplished without any increased to customer bills. This includes replacing PPAs as they expiry and the potential that the customers on ROA may return to bundled service, creating more headroom to pull ahead incremental capital investment. So here's the PPA example of growth not included in our plan. We have more PPAs than our peers, and as they're replaced, we're able to build new generation, new gas generation at a cost that's lower than the existing PPAs. When a nice way to grow our business and provide reliability for our customers without increasing their bills. And here is the opportunity, should ROA customers choose to return to bundled service. As they return, which may be a better economic choice for them, all our customers can experience rate reductions of about 4%. This provides headroom for more investment to meet customer needs. Think of it by replacing expiring PPAs and building for returning ROA customers, we add 3,000 megawatts of new generation that's not yet in our plan. And this is without increasing customer bills at all, a clear win for our customers and a clear win for our investors.
You can see the need for new generation in MISO's most recent report. MISO updated their 2016 capacity forecast, showing MISO will be short 1.5 gigawatts in Zone 7 by spring. With our newly purchased Jackson gas plant, we can provide sufficient capacity for our bundled customers. We can't, however, be sure if AES suppliers can do the same for those ROA customers. And by the way, our mix of coal fuel capacity has been reduced from over 40% to 1/3 today. And as you can see in the appendix slide, with coal plant closures next year, the mix will be below 25%.
With our business model, we've been able to deliver consistent earnings growth of more than 7% each year for over a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership and through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you too, see this as a sustainable model for our customers and our investors for a decade ahead. As you can imagine, with this consistent investment growth, our operating cash flow as a percent of market cap has gone from less than our peers 5 years ago to greater than our peers today, with prospects that additional growth will provide an even larger cash flow.
This is a nice place to be providing resources for the future. Resources to invest more for our customers, more rate base growth and/or improved capital structure. So here's our sensitivity chart that we provide you each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospect. In this time of rising and volatile interest rates, it's comforting to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in interest rates. At the utility, higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and perhaps, a higher return on equity in the future.
At the parent, our practice includes pre-funding parent debt 2 years in advance and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This insulates us from substantial risk to change in interest rates. If, for example, interest rates rise from our planned by 100 basis points, the annual earnings impact would be less than a $0.01 a share and we already include high interest rates in our 10-year plan.
Here's our report card for 2015. We're in a good position and at the midway point with substantial benefit from the arctic blast earlier in the year, and better than planned cost reduction so far this year. We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and we're accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors, permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We have the best cost-reduction track record in the nation. We're in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest and your support. We appreciate you calling in and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So operator, would you please open up the line?"

We suspect that as the policymakers work through this during the summer months, and do something before the end of this year, that from an ROA standpoint, there may be an economic opportunity that comes out of the law where customers will decide it's probably better to be with bundled service because they're likely to have the secure not only energy but capacity as they go forward. And to do that, they may find bundled service a better place to do, and that's exactly what we like. We like seeing them make the right economic decisions. So the answer again to your question is yes."

Now I'm just speculating, but take something like energy efficiency. To ensure that we continue to do the good work we're doing today, then may be a little bridge that says you continue on a program you have today for a period of time before you go into new things. It's that sort of thinking that wants me to hesitate a little bit on how soon we say we'll announce new capacity. Part of it will depend on how the ROA plan goes. Returns of customers, part of it will depend on the needs of what may come out of the EPA in August and September, it may be more renewables. So we'll put all that together, be talking to the regulators and policymakers and then probably have something if you made me guess, early next year, to give you a sense of where we think we're going and what our proposals are."

We'll make sure our customers, our bundled customers, are covered. So from a capacity standpoint, we've got a lot of optionality even though the state's going to be short, probably or at least the lower Peninsula in the spring of next year. We will have tools to take care of our folks. What we're uncertain about and part of what the law's about is who's going to take care of the ROA customers? Is that something that the AES' are willing to do economically with those ROA customers? Or is it something that we really do need to step in for long-term planning basis? So here are the steps. First, the Public Service Commission will put some parameters together for the IRP filings. So they'll take a little time to do that. Second, within a couple of years of the enactment, there has to be IRPs filed, so you see the total flexibility in there but, that's the next step and that will include a long-term outlook. And then before we file an IRP, if you follow the bills the way they're structured today, we would do bid in RFP to make sure we understand what's out there in the market that we would factor into our plans. Now you might think of that as oh, what does that mean? You're not going to be ale to build things. I wouldn't think of that at all. I think of that as the commonsense we use. Remember, we were about to build a new gas generation plant in Thetford, and instead, we twice went out on our own to check the market and in the second check, which was last December, we found my goodness, there's a far better deal for our customers. We were thrilled to put that in place and did that change our capital investment totals at all? No. As we backfilled with things that we can't fit in today with things that needed to be fitted, so that worked just perfect. So when you get into the RFP process, there's -- they call it a shot clock, interesting. A little basketball hoopers in here, there'll be a 270-day process for that to go through. So you see, that's a little bit of a long process. And therefore, there'll be some bridging in between on several issues, which could include energy efficiencies. It could include a bridging around generation plans where the existing con might be used as a quick process to cover needs in the future and not have to wait for a year or 2 or so, to make those decisions. It's all up in the air and it's all the kind of discussion that's happening this summer and everybody seems to have their head screwed on very right to make sure that the state and our customers are taken care of. That makes sense?"

Remember, it was $45 million, so just the portion that impacts the second half is about a nickel of bad news. And then we've got great relief and everything else. Remember, just about all of our rate relief that we're talking about is really second half. So think of the electric rate case as your example. On the electric rate case, we just self-implemented. So we're actually collecting that, we get all that upside as we go through the second half in the year, something we didn't have in the first half the year. So I would tell you, there's a lot of natural things like that, that don't require lot of wishing and praying or worrying of any kind. And then have you think about Slide 13 that shows the reinvestment plan. We're actually still in the mode of looking where we deploy our resources in steps throughout the course of the year, to go from $0.13 better than planned to what would leave you with a good 5% to 7% earnings growth. So we're in, I'd say great shape. This is actually a fun place to be. It's a little tougher when it's the other way, like it was about 3 years ago when we had a really mild winter and we had a fine $0.13, which we did. And as you know, the actions speak from themselves, we're in great shape. So not a lot of pressure for us, but you can see our normal cost reductions coming in place. We're now getting rate relief in the second, we didn't have in the first half. And so the comps I guess, are a little bit easier if you look at it that way."

So when you think about the generation side of things, those are a little bit longer term as into our plan but there's plenty of short-term things to do as well. And I'm actually going to take you to a slide that you'd prefer not to be taken to, I think, instead of the one you're talking to, and that's Slide 13, which shows the reinvestment curb again. Here's the best way I can encourage everybody to think about this. There are some very important things we don't have to do, but we sure would like to do for our customers. Tree trimming is one of the simplest explanations I have. Our tree trimming cycle is closer to 10 years, and it should be closer to 5 or 6 years. So the commission's kind enough to give us a little bit more with each rate case, and then they know every time we can find an opportunity to do a little bit more when we have good news from cost reductions or whether or whatever it is, we'll also do a little bit more. What I would caution everybody is, yes, underneath, we could probably be growing a lot faster than 5% to 7%. But inside, as long as we have that opportunity to do these important things for our customers, we're going to do those. And I think there will be things like that to do certainly this year, and I think certainly next year, and then we'll talk about the future after that. And that's not a hint or up-and-down, we'll just talk about that a little bit later. The other thing it does for us, is by doing this work like the Digg pull ahead and like more tree trimming and whatever, it actually makes it easier for us to deliver the next year because our customers are better off. We pull costs ahead that would have happened the next year or the year after, but it makes it easy for us to deliver the good results that you need to see. So no move from the 5% to 7% certainly not today."

It's oscillating. Those 2 are not making the big recovery that typically you would see after a recession. So that's still ahead of us, that hasn't started happening yet. The point for today is probably more around the industrial side when you look at the data. Our growth was over 1% in the first half, and we know that it's underlying growth is better than 2%. So you may say, what's happening? I have to be careful because I can't talk about specific company. But there is an individual company that's a big customer, a very low margin customer of ours, and they have an interruption on a supply side. And it was a stubborn one and I'm not even sure and it's not my business to say when they'll be coming out of that, but obviously, they'll work their way through that. And when that comes back through, you'll see the industrial numbers back up to what we think is a more reasonable level. So keep in mind, we expect that to happen for the future, and we really haven't factored in all the 3% of new growth from the new businesses locating, which will be largely late this year, mostly '16 and some '17.

If you don't have a mandate because the policymakers would rather make sure that the IRP process is more thoughtful around what the important things are doing. And then an IRP process, you might come up with 4% renewables as opposed to a mandate might say something else. The policymakers think the IRP process will be more thoughtful, and when we get into all the needs for capacity, for environmental compliance and those sorts of things, I think you're naturally going to see a mix of renewables, a continuing mix of energy efficiency and we'll probably need to put some capacity in place. So when you were relating it to sales growth, I know you were thinking more choice. I would tell you, we've assumed 10% continues forever in our plans.

He's recovering from a medical procedure and we look forward to his return in a few weeks. I know he'll miss fueling your questions today. Then we'll begin the call with an overview of the quarter and provide an update on a legislative process before turning to more detail on the gas business, the first half and our growth model. And then we'll close with Q&A. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.98, down $0.07 from last year, but up $0.03 on a weather adjusted basis, or $0.13 ahead of plan. Today, we're reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.86 to $1.89 and as you know, this reflects real growth of 5% to 7% off last year's actual results. We filed our gas rate case last week for $85 million. Like our previous cases, it's small and primarily driven by capital investment. Even with this rate case, we expect total customer bills to decrease in 2016 due to lower gas commodity prices. Last month, we self-implemented our electric rate case at $110 million. Now we expect an order for this case in December, which would mark 2.5 years since the last order. Our predictable growth has continued over that time, and we've self-initiated many cost reductions to keep prices low for our customers.
Here, you can see the impact of our actions along with constructive regulatory environment. Our industrial rates are at a competitive level that's attracting new business to the state. Rates could be improved further with changes to ROA policy, creating a competitive advantage for Michigan's business in the Midwest and in the country. As we've improved industrial rates, residential bills have remained low at about $3 a day.
Recently, we committed to do more in Michigan and help grow businesses. Our spending on in-state goods and services will be $1 billion per year over the next 5 years. By helping to make Michigan a competitive state in which to do business, we are seeing growth. In Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory, housing, GDP, population growth and unemployment are all better today than Michigan and as a whole in the U.S. Overall, Michigan is moving toward becoming a top 10 state, and Grand Rapids is leading the way.
Michigan's energy law update can help to drive this growth. Bills are now in committees with the house and senate. Recently, senate committee Chairman, Mike Knobbs introduced a comprehensive bill after considerable research and debate. The senator's bill proposes to keep the ROA cap, however, the bill stipulates stringent requirements for both ROA suppliers and customers. In order to protect all customers from reliability and price volatility, the supplier would be required to procure a minimum of 3 years of capacity, and ROA customers who decide to stay with alternative suppliers will be required to provide a 3-year notice prior to returning to bundled utility service. Once a customer returns from ROA, they're no longer eligible to switch back. These policy leaders are broadly in agreement with the integrated resources plan process, which will give the state the flexibility it needs among many things, to enable investment in needed new generation and comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The IRP would replace the existing certificate of necessity process with a more comprehensive, longer-term decision-making process. The IRP would provide us with the assurance of recovery and allow us to plan capacity resources for a decade or more. This transparent process could include new gas capacity, renewables and efficiency programs. Now on the regulatory front, I'm pleased to highlight the governor's announcement yesterday of the appointment of Norm Saari, as a new Public Service Commissioner. He has a long track record of public and private service in the utility sector and public policy space. We look forward to working with him. 
We continue to look at and evaluate new investment opportunities that could increase the capital spending in our 10-year plan. When we look at these opportunities, we evaluate each one by asking them, does it add customer value? Does it reduce O&M cost? Does it help balance our fuel sources? And/or, is it mandated by state or federal regulations? And none of our investments in the plan or those identified as opportunities are big bets. Our gas business is one of the larger distribution systems in the country. This scale provides many investment opportunities for additional growth. We've been upgrading our compressor stations, installing new transmission lines and replacing aging infrastructure. We could do more, and we could accelerate the pace.
Our plan calls for doubling gas investment over the next 10 years. This brings our investment mix to over 1/3 gas. Our customers benefit from the safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness of the gas plan. If fuel costs remain low, additional headroom will allow us to make these investments without impairing price. On average, our gas customers spend about $2 a day. That's equal to their bill in 2004.
Now here's a little more detail on our results. For the second quarter, our earnings were $0.25 a share on both our reported and on adjusted basis. This is $0.05 below last year or $0.01 on a weather normalized basis. Weather in June was the mildest in 15 years. Cooling days were 50% lower than last year. Economic sales also reflect as one substantial low-margin customer came through a temporary supply interruption. For the first half of the year, our results were $0.98 or $0.86 on a weather normalized basis. That's $0.03 better than 2014 and at the midyear checkpoint, we are $0.13 a share or 15% better than our plan. We have lots of room to move.
As you can see here, with first half weather normalized earnings, up $0.03, we're positioned well. Even with $0.05 of cost in the second half associated with new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our cost reductions of $0.12 more than offset this. For the full year, costs are down about 3% and new rates already have been implemented. At midyear, our earnings per share is $0.13 ahead of plan and like last year and many of the years and the decade prior to that, we added substantial customer reliability work and still plan to hit our 5% to 7% guidance. O&M reinvestment of $18 million is underway, including more forestry work at the utility and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 into this year. The DIG outage pull ahead accomplishes a double benefit of accelerating the DIG outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it, and bringing up capacity in what will be a very tight market in 2016. In addition, we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts, and these reinvestments could add $20 million to profitability next year.
From time to time, some of you ask us, how we accomplish consistent earnings growth year in and year out, and how we do it without raising customer rates above inflation? As you know, we have a robust capital investment program and a substantial opportunity to increase it. However, we build our investment plan starting with customer rates growing no faster than inflation, and here's how we do that. Our O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, conservatively forecast sales growth of about 0.5% a year, avoidance of block equity dilution worth about 1 point, and other self funds, 5 points of investment. This permits earnings to grow 5% to 7% and customer rate impacts stay below inflation.
Here's our capital investment program for the next 10 years, investment in our gas business grow substantially. Investment in our electric business continues to grow too, but at a slower pace. And please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. Even without any upsides, our capital investment program over the next 10 years will be 45% larger than the last 10 years. As a percent of market cap, EMS investment was 10% over the last 10 years, it's 16% over the next 10. This exceeds peers. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. A lot of the capital investment we've put in place enables us to reduce O&M cost. These are down 10% since 2006 and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2018. There's no magic to this cost reduction program. It's simple, natural changes in our business like coal to gas generation and pole top hardening make the difference. Here's more detail around cost reduction actions, down 6% in 2 years. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to operate, the cash generation and windfarms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we'll be able to reduce our O&M by $35 million. By continuing our program to harden our pole tops, we reduced future storm-related damage and we capitalize rather than expense that work. These are just a couple of examples of how we reduced our cost 3% last year and are in the middle of a program to do another 3% this year. Since 2006 through 2014, ours is the only utility to reduce its costs, down almost 3% a year. We forecast reduction, perhaps conservatively at 2% a year between 2014 and 2018. The outlook for the economy in our utility service territory continues to be bright. As you can see here, many companies from a variety of sectors have announced new factories and businesses. This will add new growth of almost 3%. Despite this, we continued to plan conservatively, including overall sales growth at about 1.5% over the next 5 years and industrial growth of about 2%. While this is another opportunity in our model to minimize customer rate growth, there may be a little upside.
One more element of the self-funding model that promotes robust rate base and earnings growth without allowing customer rates to grow faster than inflation, is the benefit from a large stockpile of NOLs. Typically, a utility would lose about 1% of its earnings growth through a dilution associated with new equity to fund growth. In our case, we're fortunate to be able to invest our cash in utility growth rather than taxes avoiding a full point of dilution.
So the model is simple and perhaps it's a little unique. We start our planning by keeping nominal customer rate growth below inflation or in other words, we provide real rate reductions. With cost reductions, modest sales growth, no block equity dilution and shrinking surcharges, we're able to grow rate base by 5% to 7% and with substantial opportunity to do more. Many of our capital investment opportunities not yet in our plan, can be accomplished without any increase to customer bills. This includes replacing PPAs as they expiry and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, creating more headroom to pull ahead incremental capital investment. So here's the PPA example of growth not included in our plan. We have more PPAs than our peers, and as they're replaced, we're able to build new generation, new gas generation at a cost that's lower than the existing PPAs. When a nice way to grow our business and provide reliability for our customers without increasing their bills. And here is the opportunity, should ROA customers choose to return to bundled service. As they return, which may be a better economic choice for them, all our customers can experience rate reductions of about 4%. This provides headroom for more investment to meet customer needs. Think of it by replacing expiring PPAs and building for returning ROA customers, we'd add 3,000 megawatts of new generation that's not yet in our plan. And this is without increasing customer bills at all, a clear win for our customers and a clear win for our investors.
You can see the need for new generation in MISO's most recent report. MISO updated their 2016 capacity forecast, showing MISO will be short 1.5 gigawatts in Zone 7 by spring. With our newly purchased Jackson gas plant, we can provide sufficient capacity for our bundled customers. We can't, however, be sure if AES suppliers can do the same for those ROA customers. By the way, our mix of coal fuel capacity has been reduced from over 40% to 1/3 today. And as you can see in the appendix slide, with coal plant closures next year, the mix will be below 25%.
With our business model, we've been able to deliver consistent earnings growth of more than 7% each year for over a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership and through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you too, see this as a sustainable model for our customers and our investors for a decade ahead. As you can imagine, with this consistent investment growth, our operating cash flow as a percent of market cap has gone from less than our peers 5 years ago to greater than our peers today, with prospects that additional growth will provide an even larger cash flow.
This is a nice place to be providing resources for the future. Resources to invest more for our customers, more rate base growth and/or improved capital structure. So here's our sensitivity chart that we provide you each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospect. In this time of rising and volatile interest rates, it's comforting to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in interest rates. At the utility, higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and perhaps, a higher return on equity in the future.
At the parent, our practice includes pre-funding parent debt 2 years in advance and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This insulates us from substantial risk to change in interest rates. If, for example, interest rates rise from our planned by 100 basis points, the annual earnings impact would be less than a $0.01 a share, and we already include high interest rates in our 10-year plan.
Here's our report card for 2015. We're in a good position and at the mid-way point with substantial benefit from the arctic blast earlier in the year, and better than planned cost reduction so far this year. We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and we're accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors, permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We have the best cost-reduction track record in the nation. We're in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest and your support. We appreciate you calling in, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So operator, would you please open up the line?"

Returns of customers, part of it will depend on the needs of what may come out of the EPA in August and September, may be more renewables.

We'll make sure our customers, our bundled customers, are covered. So from a capacity standpoint, we've got a lot of optionality even though the state's going to be short, probably or at least the lower Peninsula in the spring of next year. We will have tools to take care of our folks. What we're uncertain about and part of what the law's about is who's going to take care of the ROA customers? Is that something that the AES' are willing to do economically with those ROA customers? Or is it something where we really do need to step in for long-term planning basis? So here are the steps. First, the Public Service Commission will put some parameters together for the IRP filings. So they'll take a little time to do that. Second, within a couple of years of the enactment, there has to be IRPs filed, so you see there's a flexibility in there but, that's the next step and that will include a long-term outlook. And then before we file an IRP, if you follow the bills the way they're structured today, we would do bid in RFP to make sure we understand what's out there in the market that we would factor into our plans. Now you might think of that as oh, what does that mean? You're not going to be ale to build things. I wouldn't think of that at all. I think of that as the commonsense that we use. Remember, we were about to build a new gas generation plant in Thetford, and instead, we twice went out on our own to check the market and in the second check, which was last December, we found my goodness, there's a far better deal for our customers. We were thrilled to put that in place and did that change our capital investment totals at all? No. Because we backfilled with things that we can't fit in today with things that needed to be fitted, so that worked just perfect. So when you get into the RFP process, there's -- they call it a shot clock, interesting. A little basketball hoopers in here, there'll be a 270-day process for that to go through. So you see, that's a little bit of a long process. And therefore, there'll be some bridging in between on several issues, which could include energy efficiencies. It could include a bridging around generation plans where the existing con might be used as a quick process to cover needs in the future and not have to wait for a year or 2 or so, to make those decisions. That's all up in the air and that's all the kind of discussion that's happening this summer and everybody seems to have their head screwed on very right to make sure that the state and our customers are taken care of.

If you can, if you all refer to Slide 12, you will happen to see sort of the -- that's the roadmap that I think is in the slides, first half, second half. When you look at the second half, we already have programmed in actions that give us lower O&M and that's in the $0.12 that you see, that's largely what that is, and those are all underway. So there's no like new cost-reductions that desperately need to be found. And then you've got the mortality tables that are full year effect. Remember, it was $45 million, so just the portion that impacts in the second half is about a nickel of bad news. And then you've got great relief and everything else. Remember, just about all of our rate relief that we're talking about is really second half. So think of the electric rate case as an example. On the electric rate case, we just self-implemented. So we're actually collecting that, we get all that upside as we go through the second half in the year, something we didn't have in the first half the year. So I would tell you, there's a lot of natural things like that, that don't require a lot of wishing and praying or worrying of any kind. And then have you think about Slide 13 that shows the reinvestment plan. We're actually still in the mode of looking where we deploy our resources in steps throughout the course of the year, to go from $0.13 better than planned to what would leave you with a good 5% to 7% earnings growth. So we're in, I'd say great shape. This is actually a fun place to be. It's a little tougher when it's the other way, like it was about 3 years ago when we had a really mild winter and we had a fine $0.13, which we did. And as you know, the actions speak from themselves, we're in great shape. So not a lot of pressure for us, but you can see our normal cost reductions coming in place. We're now getting rate relief in the second half, we didn't have in the first half. And so the comps I guess, are a little bit easier if you look at it that way."

Here's the best way I can encourage everybody to think about this. There are some very important things we don't have to do, but we sure would like to do for our customers. Tree trimming is one of the simplest explanations I have. Our tree trimming cycle is closer to 10 years, and it should be closer to 5 or 6 years. So the commission's kind enough to give us a little bit more with each rate case, and then they know every time we can find an opportunity to do a little bit more when we have good news from cost reductions or whether or whatever it is, we'll also do a little bit more. What I would caution everybody is, yes, underneath, we could probably be growing a lot faster than 5% to 7%. But inside, as long as we have that opportunity to do these important things for our customers, we're going to do those. And I think there will be things like that to do certainly this year, and I think certainly next year, and then we'll talk about the future after that. And that's not a hint or up-and-down, we'll just talk about that a little bit later. The other thing it does for us, is by doing this work like the DIG pull ahead and like more tree trimming and whatever, it actually makes it easier for us to deliver the next year because our customers are better off. We pull costs ahead that would have happened the next year or the year after, but it makes it easy for us to deliver the good results that you need to see. So no move from the 5% to 7%, certainly not today."

But there is an individual company that's a big customer, a very low margin customer of ours, and they had an interruption on the supply side.

If you don't have a mandate because the policymakers would rather make sure that the IRP process is more thoughtful around what the important things are doing. And in an IRP process, you might come up with 4% renewables as opposed to a mandate might say something else. The policymakers think the IRP process will be more thoughtful, and when we get into all the needs for capacity, for environmental compliance and those sorts of things, I think you're naturally going to see a mix of renewables, a continuing mix of energy efficiency and we'll probably need to put some capacity in place. So when you were relating it to sales growth, I know you were thinking more choice. I would tell you, we've assumed 10% continues forever in our plans.

He's recovering from a medical procedure, and we look forward to his return in a few weeks. I know he'll miss fielding your questions today. Though we'll begin the call with an overview of the quarter and provide an update on a legislative process before turning to more detail on the gas business, the first half and our growth model. And then we'll close with Q&A. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.98, down $0.07 from last year, but up $0.03 on a weather-adjusted basis, or $0.13 ahead of plan. Today, we're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.86 to $1.89; and as you know, this reflects real growth of 5% to 7% off last year's actual results. We filed our gas rate case last week for $85 million. Like our previous cases, it's small and primarily driven by capital investment. Even with this rate case, we expect total customer bills to decrease in 2016 due to lower gas commodity prices. Last month, we self-implemented our electric rate case at $110 million. And we expect an order for this case in December, which would mark 2.5 years since the last order. Our predictable growth has continued over that time, and we've self-initiated many cost reductions to keep prices low for our customers.
Here, you can see the impact of our actions along with constructive regulatory environment. Our industrial rates are at a competitive level that's attracting new business to the state. Rates could be improved further with changes to ROA policy, creating a competitive advantage for Michigan's business in the Midwest and in the country. As we've improved industrial rates, residential bills have remained low at about $3 a day.
Recently, we committed to do more in Michigan and help grow businesses. Our spending on in-state goods and services will be $1 billion per year over the next 5 years. By helping to make Michigan a competitive state in which to do business, we are seeing growth. In Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory, housing, GDP, population growth and unemployment are all better today than Michigan and as a whole in the U.S. Overall, Michigan is moving toward becoming a top 10 state, and Grand Rapids is leading the way.
Michigan's energy law update can help to drive this growth. Bills are now in committees with the house and senate. Recently, senate committee Chairman Mike Nofs introduced a comprehensive bill after considerable research and debate. The senator's bill proposes to keep the ROA cap.  However, the bill stipulates stringent requirements for both ROA suppliers and customers. In order to protect all customers from reliability and price volatility, the supplier would be required to procure a minimum of 3 years of capacity, and ROA customers who decide to stay with alternative suppliers would be required to provide a 3-year notice prior to returning to bundled utility service. Once a customer returns from ROA, they're no longer eligible to switch back. These policy leaders are broadly in agreement with the integrated resources plan process, which would give the state the flexibility it needs among many things to enable investment in needed new generation and comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The IRP would replace the existing certificate of necessity process with a more comprehensive, longer-term decision-making process. The IRP would provide us with the assurance of recovery and allow us to plan capacity resources for a decade or more. This transparent process could include new gas capacity, renewables and efficiency programs. Now on the regulatory front, I'm pleased to highlight the governor's announcement yesterday of the appointment of Norm Saari, as a new public service commissioner. He has a long track record of public and private service in the utility sector and public policy space. We look forward to working with him. 
We continue to look at and evaluate new investment opportunities that could increase the capital spending in our 10-year plan. When we look at these opportunities, we evaluate each one by asking them, does it add customer value? Does it reduce O&M cost? Does it help balance our fuel sources? And/or is it mandated by state or federal regulations? And none of our investments in the plan or those identified as opportunities are big bets. Our gas business is one of the larger distribution systems in the country. This scale provides many investment opportunities for additional growth. We've been upgrading our compressor stations, installing new transmission lines and replacing aging infrastructure. We could do more, and we could accelerate the pace.
Our plan calls for doubling gas investment over the next 10 years. This brings our investment mix to over 1/3 gas. Our customers benefit from the safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness of the gas plan. If fuel costs remain low, additional headroom will allow us to make these investments without impairing price. On average, our gas customers spend about $2 a day. That's equal to their bill in 2004.
Now here's a little more detail on our results. For the second quarter, our earnings were $0.25 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.05 below last year or $0.01 on a weather-normalized basis. Weather in June was the mildest in 15 years. Cooling days were 50% lower than last year. Economic sales also were flat, as one substantial low-margin customer came through a temporary supply interruption. For the first half of the year, our results were $0.98 or $0.86 on a weather normalized basis. That's $0.03 better than 2014, and at the midyear checkpoint, we are $0.13 a share or 15% better than our plan. We have lots of room to move.
As you can see here, with first half weather-normalized earnings up $0.03, we're positioned well. Even with $0.05 of cost in the second half associated with new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our cost reductions of $0.12 more than offset this. For the full year, costs are down about 3%, and new rates already have been implemented. At midyear, our earnings per share is $0.13 ahead of plan. And like last year and many of the years and the decade prior to that, we added substantial customer reliability work and still plan to hit our 5% to 7% guidance. O&M reinvestment of $18 million is underway, including more forestry work at the utility and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 into this year. The DIG outage pull ahead accomplishes a double benefit of accelerating the DIG outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and bringing up capacity in what will be a very tight market in 2016. In addition, we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts, and these reinvestments could add $20 million to profitability next year.
From time to time, some of you ask us how we accomplish consistent earnings growth year in and year out and how we do it without raising customer rates above inflation. As you know, we have a robust capital investment program and a substantial opportunity to increase it. However, we build our investment plan starting with customer rates growing no faster than inflation, and here's how we do that. Our O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, conservatively forecast sales growth of about 0.5% a year, avoidance of block equity dilution worth about 1 point and other self funds, 5 points of investment. This permits earnings to grow 5% to 7%, and customer rate impacts stay below inflation.
Here's our capital investment program for the next 10 years. Investment in our gas business grow substantially. Investment in our electric business continues to grow too but at a slower pace. And please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. Even without any upsides, our capital investment program over the next 10 years will be 45% larger than the last 10 years. As a percent of market cap, EMS investment was 10% over the last 10 years. It's 16% over the next 10. This exceeds peers. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. A lot of the capital investment we've put in place enables us to reduce O&M cost. These are down 10% since 2006 and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2018. There's no magic to this cost reduction program. It's simple. Natural changes in our business, like coal to gas generation and pole top hardening, make the difference. Here's more detail around cost reduction actions, down 6% in 2 years. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to operate, to gas generation and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we'll be able to reduce our O&M by $35 million. By continuing our program to harden our pole tops, we reduced future storm-related damage, and we capitalize rather than expense that work. These are just a couple of examples of how we've reduced our cost 3% last year and are in the middle of a program to do another 3% this year. Since 2006 through 2014, ours is the only utility to reduce its costs, down almost 3% a year. We forecast reduction, perhaps conservatively, at 2% a year between 2014 and 2018. The outlook for the economy in our utility service territory continues to be bright. As you can see here, many companies from a variety of sectors have announced new factories and businesses. This will add new growth of almost 3%. Despite this, we continue to plan conservatively, including overall sales growth at about 1.5% over the next 5 years and industrial growth of about 2%. While this is another opportunity in our model to minimize customer rate growth, there may be a little upside.
One more element of the self-funding model that promotes robust rate base and earnings growth without allowing customer rates to grow faster than inflation is the benefit from a large stockpile of NOLs. Typically, a utility would lose about 1% of its earnings growth through dilution associated with new equity to fund growth. In our case, we're fortunate to be able to invest our cash in utility growth rather than taxes, avoiding a full point of dilution.
So the model is simple, and perhaps it's a little unique. We start our planning by keeping nominal customer rate growth below inflation, or in other words, we provide real rate reductions. With cost reductions, modest sales growth, no block equity dilution and shrinking surcharges, we're able to grow rate base by 5% to 7% and with substantial opportunity to do more. Many of our capital investment opportunities not yet in our plan can be accomplished without any increase to customer bills. This includes replacing PPAs as they expire and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, creating more headroom to pull ahead incremental capital investment. So here's the PPA example of growth not included in our plan. We have more PPAs than our peers, and as they're replaced, we're able to build new generation -- new gas generation at a cost that's lower than the existing PPAs. What a nice way to grow our business and provide reliability for our customers without increasing their bills. And here is the opportunity should ROA customers choose to return to bundled service. As they return, which may be a better economic choice for them, all our customers can experience rate reductions of about 4%. This provides headroom for more investment to meet customer needs. Think of it, by replacing expiring PPAs and building for returning ROA customers, we'd add 3,000 megawatts of new generation that's not yet in our plan. And this is without increasing customer bills at all, a clear win for our customers and a clear win for our investors.
You can see the need for new generation in MISO's most recent report. MISO updated their 2016 capacity forecast, showing MISO will be short 1.5 gigawatts in Zone 7 by spring. With our newly purchased Jackson gas plant, we can provide sufficient capacity for our bundled customers. We can't, however, be sure if AES suppliers can do the same for those ROA customers. By the way, our mix of coal fuel capacity has been reduced from over 40% to 1/3 today. And as you can see in the appendix slide, with coal plant closures next year the mix will be below 25%.
With our business model, we've been able to deliver consistent earnings growth of more than 7% each year for over a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership and through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you too see this as a sustainable model for our customers and our investors for a decade ahead. As you can imagine, with this consistent investment growth our operating cash flow as a percent of market cap has gone from less than our peers 5 years ago to greater than our peers today, with prospects that additional growth will provide an even larger cash flow.
This is a nice place to be providing resources for the future, resources to invest more for our customers, more rate base growth and/or improved capital structure. So here's our sensitivity chart that we provide you each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospect. In this time of rising and volatile interest rates, it's comforting to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in interest rates. At the utility, higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and perhaps a higher return on equity in the future.
At the parent, our practice includes prefunding parent debt 2 years in advance and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This insulates us from substantial risk to change in interest rates. If, for example, interest rates rise from our plan by 100 basis points, the annual earnings impact would be less than a $0.01 a share, and we already include high interest rates in our 10-year plan.
Here's our report card for 2015. We're in a good position and at the midway point with substantial benefit from the Arctic blast earlier in the year and better than planned cost reduction so far this year. We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers, and we're accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We have the best cost-reduction track record in the nation. We're in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest and your support. We appreciate you calling in, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So operator, would you please open up the line?"

So that will have work done by the state to start planning where we need to be to meet PPA requirements, to do our own state requirements on environmental, all of that. That will be followed by the official IRP process. So that will take a little while. So I suspect what you'll see in the law are some bridging actions. Now I'm just speculating, but take something like energy efficiency. To ensure that we can continue to do the good work we're doing today, there may be a little bridge that says you continue on a program you have today for a period of time before you go into new things. It's that sort of thinking that wants me to hesitate a little bit on how soon we say we'll announce new capacity. Part of it will depend on how the ROA plan goes, returns of customers. Part of it will depend on the needs of what may come out of the EPA in August and September, maybe more renewables. So we'll put all that together, be talking to the regulators and policymakers and then probably have something, if you made me guess, early next year to give you a sense of where we think we're going and what our proposals are."

We'll make sure our customers, our bundled customers, are covered. So from a capacity standpoint, we've got a lot of optionality, even though the state's going to be short probably are -- at least the Lower Peninsula in the spring of next year. We will have tools to take care of our folks. What we're uncertain about and part of what the law's about is who's going to take care of the ROA customers? Is that something that the AESs are willing to do economically with those ROA customers? Or it's something where we really do need to step in for a long-term planning basis? So here are the steps. First, the Public Service Commission will put some parameters together for the IRP filings. So they'll take a little time to do that. Second, within a couple of years of the enactment, there has to be IRPs filed, so you see there's a flexibility in there, but that's the next step, and that will include a long-term outlook. And then before we file an IRP, if you follow the bills the way they're structured today, we would do bid in RFP to make sure we understand what's out there in the market that we would factor into our plans. Now you might think of that as ""Oh, what does that mean? You're not going to be able to build things."" I wouldn't think of that at all. I would think of that as the commonsense that we use. Remember, we were about to build a new gas generation plant in Thetford; and instead, we twice went out on our own to check the market. And in the second check, which was last December, we found, my goodness, there's a far better deal for our customers. We were thrilled to put that in place. And did that change our capital investment totals at all? No. Because we backfilled with things that we can't fit in today with things that needed to be fit in it, so that worked just perfect. So then when you get into the RFP process, there's -- they call it a shot clock, interesting. A little basketball hoopers in here -- there'll be a 270-day process for that to go through. So you see, that's a little bit of a long process. And therefore, there'll be some bridging in between on several issues, which could include energy efficiencies. It could include a bridging around generation plans where the existing con might be used as a quick process to cover needs in the future and not have to wait for a year or 2 or so to make those decisions. That's all up in the air, and that's all the kind of discussion that's happening this summer. And everybody seems to have their head screwed on very right to make sure that the state and our customers are taken care of. That makes sense?"

If you can, if you all refer to Slide 12, you'll happen to see sort of the -- that's a roadmap that I think is in the slides, first half, second half. When you look at the second half, we already have programmed in actions that give us lower O&M, and that's in the $0.12 that you see. That's largely what that is, and those are all underway. So there's no like new cost reductions that desperately need to be found. And then you've got the mortality tables that are -- the full year effect, you remember, was $45 million, so just the portion that impacts in the second half is about a nickel of bad news. And then you've got rate relief and everything else. Remember, just about all of our rate relief that we're talking about is really second half. So think of the electric rate case as an example. On the electric rate case, we just self-implemented. So we're actually collecting that. We get all that upside as we go through the second half in the year, something we didn't have in the first half the year. So I would tell you there's a lot of natural things like that, that don't require a lot of wishing and praying or worrying of any kind. And then have you think about Slide 13 that shows the reinvestment plan. We're actually still in the mode of looking where we deploy our resources in steps throughout the course of the year to go from $0.13 better than plan to what would leave you with a good 5% to 7% earnings growth. So we're in, I'd say, great shape. This is actually a fun place to be. It's a little tougher when it's the other way, like it was about 3 years ago when we had a really mild winter, and we had to find $0.13, which we did. And as you know, the actuals speak from themselves, we're in great shape. So not a lot of pressure for us, but you can see our normal cost reductions coming in place. We're now getting rate relief in the second half we didn't have in the first half. And so the comps I guess, are a little bit easier if you look at it that way."

And I'm actually going to take you to a slide that you'd prefer not to be taken to, I think, instead of the one you're talking to, and that's Slide 13, which shows the reinvestment curve again. Here's the best way I can encourage everybody to think about this. There are some very important things we don't have to do but we sure would like to do for our customers. Tree trimming is one of the simplest explanations I have. Our tree-trimming cycle is closer to 10 years, and it should be closer to 5 or 6 years. So the commission's kind enough to give us a little bit more with each rate case, and then they know every time we can find an opportunity to do a little bit more when we have good news from cost reductions or whether or whatever it is we'll also do a little bit more. What I would caution everybody is, yes, underneath, we could probably be growing a lot faster than 5% to 7%. But inside, as long as we have that opportunity to do these important things for our customers, we're going to do those. And I think there will be things like that to do certainly this year, and I think certainly next year, and then we'll talk about the future after that. And that's not a hint or up and down. We'll just talk about that a little bit later. The other thing it does for us is by doing this work, like the DIG pull ahead and like more tree trimming and whatever, it actually makes it easier for us to deliver the next year because our customers are better off, we've pulled costs ahead that would have happened the next year or the year after. So it makes it easy for us to deliver the good results that you need to see. So no move from the 5% to 7%, certainly not today."

The point for today is probably more around the industrial side. When you look at the data, our growth was over 1% in the first half, and we know that its underlying growth is better than 2%. So you may say, what's happening? I have to be careful because I can't talk about a specific company. But there is an individual company that's a big customer, a very low-margin customer of ours, and they had an interruption on the supply side.

And when we get into all the needs for capacity, for environmental compliance and those sorts of things, I think you're naturally going to see a mix of renewables, a continuing mix of energy efficiency, and we'll probably need to put some capacity in place. So when you were relating it to sales growth, I know you were thinking more choice. I would tell you we've assumed 10% continues forever in our plans. So if you were to conclude that ROA customers might be coming back in this process, that'll actually help sales."

He's recovering from a medical procedure, and we look forward to his return in a few weeks. I know he'll miss fielding your questions today. Though we'll begin the call with an overview of the quarter and provide an update on a legislative process before turning to more detail on the gas business, the first half and our growth model. And then we'll close with Q&A. For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.98, down $0.07 from last year, but up $0.03 on a weather-adjusted basis, or $0.13 ahead of plan. Today, we're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.86 to $1.89; and as you know, this reflects real growth of 5% to 7% off last year's actual results. We filed our gas rate case last week for $85 million. Like our previous cases, it's small and primarily driven by capital investment. Even with this rate case, we expect total customer bills to decrease in 2016 due to lower gas commodity prices. Last month, we self-implemented our electric rate case at $110 million. And we expect an order for this case in December, which would mark 2.5 years since the last order. Our predictable growth has continued over that time, and we've self-initiated many cost reductions to keep prices low for our customers.
Here, you can see the impact of our actions along with constructive regulatory environment. Our industrial rates are at a competitive level that's attracting new business to the state. Rates could be improved further with changes to ROA policy, creating a competitive advantage for Michigan's business in the Midwest and in the country. As we've improved industrial rates, residential bills have remained low at about $3 a day.
Recently, we committed to do more in Michigan and help grow businesses. Our spending on in-state goods and services will be $1 billion per year over the next 5 years. By helping to make Michigan a competitive state in which to do business, we are seeing growth. In Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory, housing, GDP, population growth and unemployment are all better today than Michigan and as a whole in the U.S. Overall, Michigan is moving toward becoming a top 10 state, and Grand Rapids is leading the way.
Michigan's energy law update can help to drive this growth. Bills are now in committees with the house and senate. Recently, Senate Committee Chairman Mike Nofs introduced a comprehensive bill after considerable research and debate. The senator's bill proposes to keep the ROA cap.  However, the bill stipulates stringent requirements for both ROA suppliers and customers. In order to protect all customers from reliability and price volatility, the supplier would be required to procure a minimum of 3 years of capacity, and ROA customers who decide to stay with alternative suppliers would be required to provide a 3-year notice prior to returning to bundled utility service. Once a customer returns from ROA, they're no longer eligible to switch back. These policy leaders are broadly in agreement with the integrated resources plan process, which would give the state the flexibility it needs among many things to enable investment in needed new generation and comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The IRP would replace the existing certificate of necessity process with a more comprehensive, longer-term decision-making process. The IRP would provide us with the assurance of recovery and allow us to plan capacity resources for a decade or more. This transparent process could include new gas capacity, renewables and efficiency programs. Now on the regulatory front, I'm pleased to highlight the governor's announcement yesterday of the appointment of Norm Saari, as a new Public Service Commissioner. He has a long track record of public and private service in the utility sector and public policy space. We look forward to working with him. 
We continue to look at and evaluate new investment opportunities that could increase the capital spending in our 10-year plan. When we look at these opportunities, we evaluate each one by asking them, does it add customer value? Does it reduce O&M cost? Does it help balance our fuel sources? And/or is it mandated by state or federal regulations? And none of our investments in the plan or those identified as opportunities are big bets. Our gas business is one of the larger distribution systems in the country. This scale provides many investment opportunities for additional growth. We've been upgrading our compressor stations, installing new transmission lines and replacing aging infrastructure. We could do more, and we could accelerate the pace.
Our plan calls for doubling gas investment over the next 10 years. This brings our investment mix to over 1/3 gas. Our customers benefit from the safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness of the gas plan. If fuel costs remain low, additional headroom will allow us to make these investments without impairing price. On average, our gas customers spend about $2 a day. That's equal to their bill in 2004.
Now here's a little more detail on our results. For the second quarter, our earnings were $0.25 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.05 below last year or $0.01 on a weather-normalized basis. Weather in June was the mildest in 15 years. Cooling days were 50% lower than last year. Economic sales also were flat, as one substantial low-margin customer came through a temporary supply interruption. For the first half of the year, our results were $0.98 or $0.86 on a weather normalized basis. That's $0.03 better than 2014, and at the midyear checkpoint, we are $0.13 a share or 15% better than our plan. We have lots of room to move.
As you can see here, with first half weather-normalized earnings up $0.03, we're positioned well. Even with $0.05 of cost in the second half associated with new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our cost reductions of $0.12 more than offset this. For the full year, costs are down about 3%, and new rates already have been implemented. At midyear, our earnings per share is $0.13 ahead of plan. And like last year and many of the years and the decade prior to that, we added substantial customer reliability work and still plan to hit our 5% to 7% guidance. O&M reinvestment of $18 million is underway, including more forestry work at the utility and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 into this year. The DIG outage pull ahead accomplishes a double benefit of accelerating the DIG outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and bringing up capacity in what will be a very tight market in 2016. In addition, we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts, and these reinvestments could add $20 million to profitability next year.
From time to time, some of you ask us how we accomplish consistent earnings growth year in and year out and how we do it without raising customer rates above inflation. As you know, we have a robust capital investment program and a substantial opportunity to increase it. However, we build our investment plan starting with customer rates growing no faster than inflation, and here's how we do that. Our O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, conservatively forecast sales growth of about 0.5% a year, avoidance of block equity dilution worth about 1 point and other self funds, 5 points of investment. This permits earnings to grow 5% to 7%, and customer rate impacts stay below inflation.
Here's our capital investment program for the next 10 years. Investment in our gas business grow substantially. Investment in our electric business continues to grow too but at a slower pace. And please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. Even without any upsides, our capital investment program over the next 10 years will be 45% larger than the last 10 years. As a percent of market cap, EMS investment was 10% over the last 10 years. It's 16% over the next 10. This exceeds peers. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. A lot of the capital investment we've put in place enables us to reduce O&M cost. These are down 10% since 2006 and will reduce these costs another 7% by 2018. There's no magic to this cost reduction program. It's simple. Natural changes in our business, like coal to gas generation and pole top hardening, make the difference. Here's more detail around cost reduction actions, down 6% in 2 years. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to operate, to gas generation and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we'll be able to reduce our O&M by $35 million. By continuing our program to harden our pole tops, we reduced future storm-related damage, and we capitalize rather than expense that work. These are just a couple of examples of how we've reduced our cost 3% last year and are in the middle of a program to do another 3% this year. Since 2006 through 2014, ours is the only utility to reduce its costs, down almost 3% a year. We forecast reduction, perhaps conservatively, at 2% a year between 2014 and 2018. The outlook for the economy in our utility service territory continues to be bright. As you can see here, many companies from a variety of sectors have announced new factories and businesses. This will add new growth of almost 3%. Despite this, we continue to plan conservatively, including overall sales growth at about 1.5% over the next 5 years and industrial growth of about 2%. While this is another opportunity in our model to minimize customer rate growth, there may be a little upside.
One more element of the self-funding model that promotes robust rate base and earnings growth without allowing customer rates to grow faster than inflation is the benefit from a large stockpile of NOLs. Typically, a utility would lose about 1% of its earnings growth through dilution associated with new equity to fund growth. In our case, we're fortunate to be able to invest our cash in utility growth rather than taxes, avoiding a full point of dilution.
So the model is simple, and perhaps it's a little unique. We start our planning by keeping nominal customer rate growth below inflation, or in other words, we provide real rate reductions. With cost reductions, modest sales growth, no block equity dilution and shrinking surcharges, we're able to grow rate base by 5% to 7% and with substantial opportunity to do more. Many of our capital investment opportunities not yet in our plan can be accomplished without any increase to customer bills. This includes replacing PPAs as they expire and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, creating more headroom to pull ahead incremental capital investment. So here's the PPA example of growth not included in our plan. We have more PPAs than our peers, and as they're replaced, we're able to build new generation -- new gas generation at a cost that's lower than the existing PPAs. What a nice way to grow our business and provide reliability for our customers without increasing their bills. And here is the opportunity should ROA customers choose to return to bundled service. As they return, which may be a better economic choice for them, all our customers can experience rate reductions of about 4%. This provides headroom for more investment to meet customer needs. Think of it, by replacing expiring PPAs and building for returning ROA customers, we'd add 3,000 megawatts of new generation that's not yet in our plan. And this is without increasing customer bills at all, a clear win for our customers and a clear win for our investors.
You can see the need for new generation in MISO's most recent report. MISO updated their 2016 capacity forecast, showing MISO will be short 1.5 gigawatts in Zone 7 by spring. With our newly purchased Jackson gas plant, we can provide sufficient capacity for our bundled customers. We can't, however, be sure if AES suppliers can do the same for those ROA customers. By the way, our mix of coal fuel capacity has been reduced from over 40% to 1/3 today. And as you can see in the appendix slide, with coal plant closures next year the mix will be below 25%.
With our business model, we've been able to deliver consistent earnings growth of more than 7% each year for over a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership and through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you too see this as a sustainable model for our customers and our investors for a decade ahead. As you can imagine, with this consistent investment growth our operating cash flow as a percent of market cap has gone from less than our peers 5 years ago to greater than our peers today, with prospects that additional growth will provide an even larger cash flow.
This is a nice place to be providing resources for the future, resources to invest more for our customers, more rate base growth and/or improved capital structure. So here's our sensitivity chart that we provide you each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospect. In this time of rising and volatile interest rates, it's comforting to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in interest rates. At the utility, higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and perhaps a higher return on equity in the future.
At the parent, our practice includes prefunding parent debt 2 years in advance and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This insulates us from substantial risk to change in interest rates. If, for example, interest rates rise from our plan by 100 basis points, the annual earnings impact would be less than a $0.01 a share, and we already include high interest rates in our 10-year plan.
Here's our report card for 2015. We're in a good position and at the midway point with substantial benefit from the Arctic blast earlier in the year and better than planned cost reduction so far this year. We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers, and we're accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016.
Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We have the best cost-reduction track record in the nation. We're in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest and your support. We appreciate you calling in, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So operator, would you please open up the line?"

And to do that, they may find bundled service a better place to do, and that's exactly what we like. We like seeing them make the right economic decisions.

Now I'm just speculating, but take something like energy efficiency. To ensure that we can continue to do the good work we're doing today, there may be a little bridge that says you continue on a program you have today for a period of time before you go into new things. It's that sort of thinking that wants me to hesitate a little bit on how soon we say we'll announce new capacity. Part of it will depend on how the ROA plan goes, returns of customers. Part of it will depend on the needs of what may come out of the EPA in August and September, maybe more renewables. So we'll put all that together, be talking to the regulators and policymakers and then probably have something, if you made me guess, early next year to give you a sense of where we think we're going and what our proposals are."

So from a capacity standpoint, we've got a lot of optionality, even though the state's going to be short probably are -- at least the Lower Peninsula in the spring of next year. We will have tools to take care of our folks. What we're uncertain about and part of what the law's about is who's going to take care of the ROA customers? Is that something that the AESs are willing to do economically with those ROA customers? Or it's something where we really do need to step in for a long-term planning basis? So here are the steps. First, the Public Service Commission will put some parameters together for the IRP filings. So they'll take a little time to do that. Second, within a couple of years of the enactment, there has to be IRPs filed, so you see there's a flexibility in there, but that's the next step, and that will include a long-term outlook. And then before we file an IRP, if you follow the bills the way they're structured today, we would do bid in RFP to make sure we understand what's out there in the market that we would factor into our plans. Now you might think of that as ""Oh, what does that mean? You're not going to be able to build things."" I wouldn't think of that at all. I would think of that as the commonsense that we use. Remember, we were about to build a new gas generation plant in Thetford; and instead, we twice went out on our own to check the market. And in the second check, which was last December, we found, my goodness, there's a far better deal for our customers. We were thrilled to put that in place. And did that change our capital investment totals at all? No. Because we backfilled with things that we can't fit in today with things that needed to be fit in it, so that worked just perfect. So then when you get into the RFP process, there's -- they call it a shot clock, interesting. A little basketball hoopers in here -- there'll be a 270-day process for that to go through. So you see, that's a little bit of a long process. And therefore, there'll be some bridging in between on several issues, which could include energy efficiencies. It could include a bridging around generation plans where the existing con might be used as a quick process to cover needs in the future and not have to wait for a year or 2 or so to make those decisions. That's all up in the air, and that's all the kind of discussion that's happening this summer. And everybody seems to have their head screwed on very right to make sure that the state and our customers are taken care of. That makes sense?"

We have adequate plans in place to take care of all of our bundled customers. If for some reason there was an emergency -- and I'll do a theoretical thing -- all ROA customers chose to come back to bundled service right away, we would find short-term measures to cover that. And think purchases on the market, think use of short-term PPAs, think DIG, think all and list the options like that. There are many. So short-term, we could be in very good shape. Longer term, we'd want to plan for more certainty. So what we would work on is how to put more permanent capacity in place in Zone 7 so our customers will essentially own their generation as opposed to renting it."

If you just -- what do you see as the -- kind of the big bridge drivers as we look at the second half of '15 verses '14?

If you just -- what do you see as the -- kind of the big bridge drivers as we look at the second half of '15 verses '14?

If you can, if you all refer to Slide 12, you'll happen to see sort of the -- that's a roadmap that I think is in the slides, first half, second half. When you look at the second half, we already have programmed in actions that give us lower O&M, and that's in the $0.12 that you see. That's largely what that is, and those are all underway. So there's no like new cost reductions that desperately need to be found. And then you've got the mortality tables that are -- the full year effect, you remember, was $45 million, so just the portion that impacts in the second half is about a nickel of bad news. And then you've got rate relief and everything else. Remember, just about all of our rate relief that we're talking about is really second half. So think of the electric rate case as an example. On the electric rate case, we just self-implemented. So we're actually collecting that. We get all that upside as we go through the second half in the year, something we didn't have in the first half the year. So I would tell you there's a lot of natural things like that, that don't require a lot of wishing and praying or worrying of any kind. And then have you think about Slide 13 that shows the reinvestment plan. We're actually still in the mode of looking where we deploy our resources in steps throughout the course of the year to go from $0.13 better than plan to what would leave you with a good 5% to 7% earnings growth. So we're in, I'd say, great shape. This is actually a fun place to be. It's a little tougher when it's the other way, like it was about 3 years ago when we had a really mild winter, and we had to find $0.13, which we did. And as you know, the actuals speak from themselves, we're in great shape. So not a lot of pressure for us, but you can see our normal cost reductions coming in place. We're now getting rate relief in the second half we didn't have in the first half. And so the comps I guess, are a little bit easier if you look at it that way."

There is a mix of things, some of which are short term and some of which are a little bit longer term. So when you think about the generation side of things, those are a little bit longer term adds into our plan, but there's plenty of short-term things to do as well. And I'm actually going to take you to a slide that you'd prefer not to be taken to, I think, instead of the one you're talking to, and that's Slide 13, which shows the reinvestment curve again. Here's the best way I can encourage everybody to think about this. There are some very important things we don't have to do but we sure would like to do for our customers. Tree trimming is one of the simplest explanations I have. Our tree-trimming cycle is closer to 10 years, and it should be closer to 5 or 6 years. So the commission's kind enough to give us a little bit more with each rate case, and then they know every time we can find an opportunity to do a little bit more when we have good news from cost reductions or whether or whatever it is we'll also do a little bit more. What I would caution everybody is, yes, underneath, we could probably be growing a lot faster than 5% to 7%. But inside, as long as we have that opportunity to do these important things for our customers, we're going to do those. And I think there will be things like that to do certainly this year, and I think certainly next year, and then we'll talk about the future after that. And that's not a hint or up and down. We'll just talk about that a little bit later. The other thing it does for us is by doing this work, like the DIG pull ahead and like more tree trimming and whatever, it actually makes it easier for us to deliver the next year because our customers are better off, we've pulled costs ahead that would have happened the next year or the year after. So it makes it easy for us to deliver the good results that you need to see. So no move from the 5% to 7%, certainly not today."

Just know that the capacity is there, but our desire to use that capacity this year, next year and who knows beyond that, is important. And it's paying off. It's paying off for our customers, and then indirectly, it's paying off big time for all of our investors by allowing us to have that happy customer group as well as to be able to deliver that 5% to 7% every year."

Those 2 are not making the big recovery that typically you would see after a recession. So that's still ahead of us. That hasn't started happening yet. The point for today is probably more around the industrial side. When you look at the data, our growth was over 1% in the first half, and we know that its underlying growth is better than 2%. So you may say, what's happening? I have to be careful because I can't talk about a specific company. But there is an individual company that's a big customer, a very low-margin customer of ours, and they had an interruption on the supply side. And it was a stubborn one, and I'm not even sure and it's not my business to say when they'll be coming out of that. But obviously, they'll work their way through that. And when that comes back through, you'll see the industrial numbers back up to what we think is a more reasonable level. So keep in mind we expect that to happen for the future, and we really haven't factored in all the 3% of new growth from new businesses locating, which will be largely late this year, mostly '16 and some '17.

If you don't have a mandate because the policy makers would rather make sure that the IRP process is more thoughtful around what the important things are doing. And in an IRP process, you might come up with 4% renewables, as opposed to a mandate might say something else. The policy makers think the IRP process will be more thoughtful. And when we get into all the needs for capacity, for environmental compliance and those sorts of things, I think you're naturally going to see a mix of renewables, a continuing mix of energy efficiency, and we'll probably need to put some capacity in place.

I'll begin the call with an update on earnings, provide an operational and legislative update and talk about some recent renewable energy developments, and how those fit into the generation portfolio. And then, I'll turn the call over to Tom, and he'll discuss in greater detail the quarter and additional upside.
Adjusted earnings per share for the first 9 months were $1.51. This is up $0.09 from last year, or 10% on a weather adjusted basis. Today, we are raising the bottom end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.01 to a new range of $1.87 to $1.89. This is up 6% to 7% over last year.
In addition, we are introducing 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. This is up 5% to 7%, which supports our consistent and year-over-year predictable performance. Here is a view of our past performance and future expectations. Our past earnings performance has been consistent and predictable. We are confident in our plan to achieve the higher end of earnings growth. Further growth upsides not in our plans plan includes more renewables, new capacity and more investment in our gas system, already one of the largest in the United States with 1.7 million customers, 29,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline and over 300 billion cubic feet of annual deliveries.
Operationally, we continue to have strong performance both. Both electric and gas residential customers rate us in the first quartile for customer satisfaction. We continue to leverage our large gas system with low natural gas prices and the largest LDC gas storage system in the country. We have invested more than $400 million in gas transmission and compression in recent years, and our customers are benefiting from that investment. Our customers are paying 60% less for natural gas than a decade ago, creating headroom for additional investments.
Overall, the business operating at a very high level. And we are setting company records in safety, reliability and simulation. Recently, our unit 3 core plan completed a record continuous run of 679 days, that's the 6th longest ever in the United States. Our major projects continue on schedule. We are seeing better-than-expected results from the upgrade, smart meters are being very well received by our customers, and we are adding more gas compression. In addition to the strong operational results, we've had a string of recent economic development wins. Our strategy has been to partner with state agencies and target companies looking to expand our site new facilities in Michigan.
As these customers begin operations, we should see an increase in our sales and a lift to the overall economy. The update, the Michigan Energy Law continues to move closer towards the goal line. The senate and house are closely aligned, and final bills are expected of the hearings are completed this month.
Over the next 2 months, we expect committee and full votes from both the senate and the house. This will allow time for the governor to sign the bill into law by the end of the year. A comprehensive update will help to eliminate unfair subsidies and the Integrated Resource Plan will ensure there are sufficient resources in place to meet the supply needs of our customers and to comply with federal and state environmental regulations. But as a reminder, our long-term plan is based on the existing 2008 Energy Law and not changes to this law. We are not waiting for new energy legislation to introduce more renewables into our portfolio. Recently, we signed a competitive wind purchase power agreement, the 100-megawatt contract spent 15 years with an option to purchase. We have broken ground on the state's largest solar garden at grand Valley State University's campus. By the end of 2016, we plan to have 10 megawatts of utility scale solar on our system. This additions to our portfolio will increase the renewable energy share beyond the 10% required in the 2008 Energy Law.
With the retirement of 7 coal units next spring, our coal mix will shrink to less than 24% of total capacity by 2017. The addition of the Jackson gas fire plants had more flexibility, while reducing operating costs. The major expansion at our Ludington pump storage facility, also, will improve of the portfolio.
Overall, we are in a good position to meet the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Although, there still a lot of work to do, we expect Michigan to be fully compliant by the deadline. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss the third quarter results."

We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. Our third quarter results of $0.53 a share reflect continued consistent progress up $0.16 from a year ago. All business units exceeded plan for a strong quarter.
For the first 9 months, earnings at $1.51 a share were up $0.09. And on a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.13 or 10%. As you can see here and as usual, strong performance positions us for delivering the high end of full year guidance. As shown in the dotted circle, cost performance continues to be robust. This slide has become popular with many. Higher than planned cost reductions and favorable weather provide substantial room for O&M reinvestment. This improves customer reliability, generates incremental productivity and accelerates a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. I just walked the DIG site, and the outage is going very well. The acceleration accomplishes 2 benefits. Accelerating the outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity in what will be a tight market in 2016.
In addition, you may recall that we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts to 748 megawatts. The impact of this reinvestment in 2015 makes it easier to achieve better reliability and profit next year. While we're on the subject to DIG, the Ferrari in the garage, you can see that the engine has been peering. As capacity prices in Michigan have risen, we've been layering in profitable contracts. Over the next few years, we could exceed our plan by as much as $20 million, and as capacity prices reached the level of cone, as much as $40 million. For example, in 2017, about half of our capacity and a quarter of over energy is still available. We're discussing the contract now that could use some of this and increase profit by about $15 million to about $35 million in 2017.
The bulk of our growth, of course, comes from our gas and electric utility investment. Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on utility sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. These do, however, create headroom for more capital investment. Our capital investment program over the next 10 years is 45% greater than the last 10 years, that's 45% greater. More than a third of this investment is for gas infrastructure. While many see more convergence, we're fortunate to already have a rich mix of gas in our business.
As a percent of market cap, CMS investment exceeded 10% over the last 10 years. It's at 16% over the next 10. The opportunity to increase investment to by another 30% are $5 million to over $20 billion continues to be practically, particularly, when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer base. Some of the opportunities include capacity for retail open access customers should they choose to return to bundle service, more renewables, additional gas infrastructure and replacing PBAs with new generation that will reduce customer bills. And many of commented on our model that starts with the customer and enhances results for investors. This organic capital investment program does not include any big bets. It is, however, that what drives our earnings growth at 5% to 7%. We're able to self fund much of this growth keeping base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. Our 5-year plan includes O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, a conservative forecast of sales growth at about half a point a year, the ability to avoid the need for block equity dilution work about another point and other. This self funds 5 points of growth without raising customer rates.
This is a big win-win with earnings growth at 5% to 7%, and customer rate impacts that stay below inflation. Our model is simple. Perhaps, it's a little unique. And we've many capital investment opportunities that just aren't yet in the plan. Most of these can be accomplished without increasing customer bills. For example, replacing PBAs has expired and the potential that customers may return to bundled service, provides incremental capital investment without increasing customer base.
Now imagine adding the equivalent of about -- a new 700-megawatt gas plant every few years for the next dozen years, and that's on top of our plan.
Here is some of the detail around the cost reduction actions, down nearly 3% on average since 2006. Looking ahead, we don't do it by squeezing a rock. We achieve our reductions with good business decisions. For example, as we switch from coal plants, which required substantial number of people to operate at gas generation and wind farms as required about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we're able to reduce our O&M by about $35 million. For another example, as we lose about 400 workers a year through attrition, new workers are added at a savings of about $40,000 each. This comes from decisions made years ago to bring new hires in with defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit pension programs and on more competitive health care programs. This saves another $35 million. While we have a clear plan for how we'll continue our cost reductions in the future, we're working on new ideas. For example, our call centers are too busy. As we introduced better service, billing and emergency mobile applications, we can respond faster and reduce call center workload. This reduced costs. Second, new technology will permit us to modernize the grid more efficiently and maintain our systems at the lower costs. Aligned loss reduction of 1 to 2 points could save $25 million to $50 million. And third, as we improved customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time. Nearly, a third of the time when we roll our trucks on the job, something goes wrong. The right parts are on the truck or other parties were needed to be on-site aren't on time. We are aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. Cost reductions come for free.
Let me take a minute to update you on the economy and sales outlook. Since 2010 through last year, Michigan's GDP is up almost 14%. That's the third best to date in the Union. And the largest city that we serve Grand Rapids is up 21%. That's among the top 10% of all cities. You can see the strong economic data for Grand Rapids compared with Michigan and the U.S. on this slide. We continue, however, to plan sales conservatively to help ensure that this is an area of upside rather than a risk. We project that industrial sales will be up about 2% annually for the next 5 years, with the overall sales up about half a point.
With a robust business model, we've been able to able to deliver consistent annual earnings growth of more than 7% for more than a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership, through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you to see this is a sustainable model for our customers and investors for a decade ahead.
Now here is our sensitivity slider to provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. You can use this slide for 2016 and 2015. There is not a lot of new news, but we do here. Some analysts raised concerns for the sector about interest rates. That's not a surprise in a time of volatile views about interest rates. I know, I have been wrong for 10 years in a row. It's comforting, however, to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in rates. Higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and programs. And this excludes a higher return on equity should rates rise a lot. On top of this, our practice includes refunding parent debt 2 years in advance, larger than pure liquidity and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This word that insulates us from risks to changes in interest rates. So here is our report card for 2015. We're in a good position with substantial benefits from the artic blast earlier in the year as well as better than cost reductions. We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016. This will be our 13th year of transparent consistent strong performance. Continuing our mindset that focuses on our customers and other investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree, we've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction, we've got the best cost reduction track record in the nation, our 13th year premium earnings includes premium dividend growth and we plan to continue with this performance for some time. So thanks for your interest, and thanks for your support. We would be delighted to take your questions. Operator, would you please open the line."

And what's the determining factor for if that is a shortfall in Michigan. On the Integrated Resource Plan, I think, you're going to see some debate about the difference between having the Integrated Resource Plan, and also, having a renewable energy standard. So right now, these are just kind of, I would call, adjustments to bring the bits together. We're at the very end of this process. So I'd expect that they happen, but most of it's is really revolving around the retail open access. And if the queue continue, there's a queue that we have beyond the 10%, the customers do they have the right to leave or do they stay throughout the entire time. So what's going on today.

If we need to produce more renewable energy or more energy through renewable energy or have energy efficiency, that will be all included in this plan. Now the good news about the law the way it is, today at least, it's not the law, but the bills that are there, is that, that would allow us to go forward and have our capital plans approved to meet the Integrated Resource Plan. And that's the assurance we want, that is we go forward to meet the plan for the Clean Power Plan, which is the federal law, that the state law and regulation supports is meeting that target.

On the grid modernization, I'd push that down a little bit further, because that's better data, better line sensors, better smart meters. So I would go out several years before I would think that as an opportunity. So you've got 1 couple of years from now, another one maybe 5 years from now, and then, go down to work management. Now that's one where we'll actually get improvements every month, every quarter, every year, and it will start slow. It's this simple. I'll tell people when you're changing your process try this yourself. If you drive a car and you back out the driveway, and you try to back out and turn the opposite direction of what you normally do, it is very hard to do. I guarantee if you try to do that over the course of 1 week, you can be going to be wrong at least a couple of times during that week. So it takes a lot of discipline, a lot of work and then, a lot of practice to make these things happen. Thus, we need somebody systems for our book management and that's going to take us for some time to put in place. So I would say, you we will see gradual bits of that come in over next year, small amounts and then a little bit more than next year. And during the life of 5 years, I think, you'll see a lot of that begin to happen. So I'd call that one over 5 years, I'd call call technology online loss past 5 years and communication something over the 5-year period. And keep in mind, some of these will end up blending the right into our plants. They will actually be some of the cost reductions we're talking about, but a lot of these will be incremental and that's a nice place to be."

Let me just to go back and see again, we're comfortable with 5% to 7% growth rate. And what helped us is, we're very balanced the financial performance for the investors with the customer value that they get. So we're constantly doing is looking at the financial, the operational and the customer side of this business. We think today, for the next several years, there's more opportunity to invest, and I'm talking not only about capital, but O&M back into customer value and back into operations, just as Tom talked about in the previous question. Here is the truck roads and some of the things we need to improve on. That's where, I think, for the next few years we really need to continue to invest and continue to grow at 5% to 7%, which is higher than our peers. What would cause this to change, I think, as Tom said in the slide that up there right now, if you can see if the law goes into effect and permit a good point I want to emphasize. If the law goes into effect as we expect, and there are shortages of capacity in Michigan, which we expected the future, customers will return to us. But it's not what happen overnight it's going to take time. So we'll not grow that as we go forward. But if you look at that in the future, if the customer satisfaction continues to be first quarter and if the operations continue to be in best-in-class then they maybe a few catalysts that Tom talked about in the out years of that would drive us to that. And you saw their, the PPA long-term, the retail open access is short-term than the PPA need to replace those. That said, I think you ought to think about for us. I mean, our plan is pretty good that we've here today and there's upside, which we wanted to show, but right now we don't have to commit to those yet because there's more work to do in the base business that we have"

The real purpose of the slide where it says, we sell fund, a lot of the growth for our customers and their dates, is when we're talking about the upside opportunity, we're trying to demonstrate short-term, if ROA customers came back and longer term when we might need to replace those PBAs and we could build gas plants or put in wind farms cheaper than the PBAs. Those are opportunities that we could put in place, and by the way, there were -- those things, I just said, as much as $3 billion. But those are opportunities we could do without hurting the self-funding part, without causing our customers to have bills going up any higher. So that's really the illustration there. Conversations about where we might go beyond 5 to 7, I think, are something for the future, but we want you to know, we wouldn't go that if it wouldn't take care of our customers at the same time."

Thanks for joining us on the call. I missed the last earnings call due to emergency surgery.

I'll begin the call with an update on earnings, provide an operational and legislative update and talk about some recent renewable energy developments, and how those fit into the generation portfolio. And then, I'll turn the call over to Tom, and we'll  discuss -- he'll discuss in greater detail the quarter and additional upsides.
Adjusted earnings per share for the first 9 months were $1.51. This is up $0.09 from last year, or 10% on a weather-adjusted basis. Today, we are raising the bottom end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.01 to a new range of $1.87 to $1.89. This is up 6% to 7% over last year.
In addition, we are introducing 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. This is up 5% to 7%, which supports our consistent and year-over-year predictable performance. 
Here is a view of our past performance and future expectations. Our past earnings performance has been consistent and predictable. We are confident in our plan to achieve the higher end of earnings growth. Further growth upsides, not in our plans plan, include more renewables, new capacity and more investment in our gas system, already one of the largest in the United States, with 1.7 million customers, 29,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipelines and over 300 billion cubic feet of annual deliveries.
Operationally, we continue to have strong performance. Both electric and gas residential customers rate us in the first quartile for customer satisfaction. We continue to leverage our large gas system with low natural gas prices and the largest LDC gas storage system in the country. We have invested more than $400 million in gas transmission and compression in recent years, and our customers are benefiting from that investment. Our customers are paying 60% less for natural gas than a decade ago, creating headroom for additional investments.
Overall, the business operating at a very high level. And we are setting company records in safety, reliability and generation. 
Recently, our Whiting Unit 3 coal plant completed a record continuous run of 679 days. That's the 6th longest ever in the United States. Our major projects continue on schedule. We are seeing better-than-expected results from the Ludington upgrade, smart meters are being very well received by our customers, and we are adding more gas compression. 
In addition to the strong operational results, we've had a string of recent economic development wins. Our strategy has been to partner with state agencies and target companies looking to expand or sight new facilities in Michigan.  As these customers begin operations, we should see an increase in our sales and a lift to the overall economy. 
The update, the Michigan Energy Law, continues to move closer towards the goal line. The Senate and House are closely aligned, and final bills are expected after hearings are completed this month.  Over the next 2 months, we expect committee and full votes from both the Senate and the House. This will allow time for the governor to sign the bill into law by the end of the year. A comprehensive update will help to eliminate unfair subsidies and the Integrated Resource Plan will ensure there are sufficient resources in place to meet the supply needs of our customers and to comply with federal and state environmental regulations. But as a reminder, our long-term plan is based on the existing 2008 Energy Law and not changes to this law. 
We are not waiting for new energy legislation to introduce more renewables into our portfolio. Recently, we signed a competitive wind purchase power agreement. The 100-megawatt contract spans 15 years with an option to purchase. We have broken ground on the state's largest solar garden at Grand Valley State University's campus. By the end of 2016, we plan to have 10 megawatts of utility-scale solar on our system. These additions to our portfolio will increase the renewable energy share beyond the 10% required in the 2008 Energy Law.
With the retirement of 7 coal units next spring, our coal mix will shrink to less than 24% of total capacity by 2017. The addition of the Jackson gas fire plant will add more flexibility, while reducing operating costs. The major expansion at our Ludington pump storage facility also will improve our portfolio.
Overall, we are in a good position to meet the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Although there still a lot of work to do, we expect Michigan to be fully compliant by the deadline. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss the third quarter results."
257682,285661795,887929,"CMS Energy Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Welcome back. Thank you for joining our call today, everyone. We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. Our third quarter results of $0.53 a share reflect continued, consistent progress, up $0.16 from",1527,"Thanks, John. Welcome back. Thank you for joining our call today, everyone. We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. 
Our third quarter results of $0.53 a share reflect continued, consistent progress, up $0.16 from a year ago. All business units exceeded plan for a strong quarter.  For the first 9 months, earnings at $1.51 a share were up $0.09. And on a weather-normalized basis, earnings were up $0.13 or 10%. 
As you can see here, and as usual, strong performance positions us for delivering the high end of full year guidance. As shown in the dotted circle, cost performance continues to be robust. 
This slide has become popular with many. Higher-than-planned cost reductions and favorable weather provide substantial room for O&M reinvestment. This improves customer reliability, generates incremental productivity and accelerates a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. I just walked the DIG site, and the outage is going very well. The acceleration accomplishes 2 benefits: accelerating the outage cost into 2015, when we have ample room to absorb it; and freeing up capacity in what will be a tight market in 2016.
In addition, you may recall that we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts to 748 megawatts. The impact of this reinvestment in 2015 makes it easier to achieve better reliability and profit next year. 
While we're on the subject to DIG, the old Ferrari in the garage, you can see that the engine's been purring. As capacity prices in Michigan have risen, we've been layering in profitable contracts. Over the next few years, we could exceed our plan by as much as $20 million, and if capacity prices reach the level of Cholla, as much as $40 million. For example, in 2017, about 1/2 of our capacity and 1/4 of our energy is still available. We're discussing a contract now that could use some of this and increase profit by about $15 million to about $35 million in 2017.
The bulk of our growth, of course, comes from our gas and electric utility investments. Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on utility sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. These do, however, create headroom for more capital investment. Our capital investment program over the next 10 years is 45% greater than the last 10 years. That's 45% greater. More than 1/3 of this investment is for gas infrastructure. While many see more convergence, we're fortunate to already have a rich mix of gas in our business.
As a percent of market cap, CMS investment exceeded 10% over the last 10 years. It's at 16% over the next 10. The opportunity to increase investment by another 30% or $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly, when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. 
Some of the opportunities include capacity for retail open access customers, should they choose to return to bundled service; more renewables; additional gas infrastructure; and replacing PPAs with new generation that will reduce customer bills. 
And many have commented on our model that starts with the customer and enhances results for investors. This organic capital investment program does not include any big bets. It is, however, that what drives our earnings growth at 5% to 7%. We're able to self fund much of this, growth keeping base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. 
Our 5-year plan includes: O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, a conservative forecast of sales growth at about 0.5 point a year, the ability to avoid the need for block equity dilution, worth about another point, and other. This self funds 5 points of growth without raising customer rates.
This is a big win-win, with earnings growth at 5% to 7%, and customer rate impacts that stay below inflation. 
Our model is simple. Perhaps, it's a little unique. And we have many capital investment opportunities that just aren't yet in the plan. Most of these can be accomplished without increasing customer bills. For example, replacing PPAs as they expire; and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, provides incremental capital investment without increasing customer bills.  Now imagine adding the equivalent of about -- a new 700-megawatt gas plant every few years for the next 12 years, and that's on top of our plan.
Here is some of the detail around the cost reduction actions, down nearly 3% a year, on average, since 2006. Looking ahead, we don't do it by squeezing a rock. We achieve our reductions with good business decisions. For example, as we switch from coal plants, which require substantial number of people to operate, to gas generation and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we're able to reduce our O&M by about $35 million. 
For another example, as we lose about 400 workers a year through attrition, new workers are added at a savings of about $40,000 each. This comes from decisions made years ago to bring new hires in with defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit pension programs and on more competitive health care programs. This saves another $35 million. 
While we have a clear plan for how we'll continue our cost reductions in the future, we're working on new ideas. For example, our call centers are too busy. As we introduce better service, billing and emergency mobile applications, we can respond faster and reduce call center workload. This reduced costs. 
Second, new technology will permit us to modernize the grid more efficiently and maintain our systems at the lower cost. A line loss reduction of 1 to 2 points could save $25 million to $50 million. 
And third, as we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time. 
Nearly 1/3 of the time when we roll our trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties that needed to be on-site aren't on time. We are aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. Cost reductions come for free.
Let me take a minute to update you on the economy and sales outlook. Since 2010 through last year, Michigan's GDP is up almost 14%. That's the third best state in the Union. And the largest city that we serve, Grand Rapids, is up 21%. That's among the top 10% of all cities. 
You can see the strong economic data for Grand Rapids compared with Michigan and the U.S. on this slide. We continue, however, to plan sales conservatively to help ensure that this is an area of upside rather than a risk. We project that industrial sales will be up about 2% annually for the next 5 years, with overall sales up about 0.5 point.
With a robust business model, we've been able to able to deliver consistent annual earnings growth of more than 7% for more than a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership, through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you, too, see this is a sustainable model for our customers and investors for a decade ahead.
Now here is our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. You can use this slide for 2016 and 2015. There's not a lot of new news, but we do hear some analysts raise concerns for the sector about interest rates. That's not a surprise in a time of volatile views about interest rates. I know I've been wrong for 10 years in a row. 
It's comforting, however, to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in rates. Higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs. And this excludes a higher return on equity, should rates rise a lot.  
On top of this, our practice includes prefunding parent debt 2 years in advance, larger-than-pure liquidity, and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This further insulates us from risks to changes in interest rates. 
So here is our report card for 2015. We're in a good position, with substantial benefits from the Arctic blast earlier in the year as well as better-than-planned cost reductions. We're putting the surplus to good use, with reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016. 
This will be our 13th year of transparent consistent strong performance. Continuing our mindset that focuses on our customers and other investors permits us to perform well. 
We hope you agree we've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We've got the best cost reduction track record in the nation. Our 13th year of premium earnings includes premium dividend growth, and we plan to continue with this performance for some time. 
So thanks for your interest, and thanks for your support. We'd be delighted to take your questions. 
Operator, would you please open the line."

When they return, how many years they have to have capacity, whether it's 3 years, 5 years. So there's some issues there. And what's the determining factor for, if there's a shortfall in Michigan. On the Integrated Resource Plan, I think, you're going to see some debate about the difference between having the Integrated Resource Plan and also having a renewable energy standard. So right now, these are just kind of, I would call, adjustments to bring the bills together. We're at the very end of this process, so I'd expect that to happen. But most of it's really revolving around the retail open access. And as the queue continues -- there's a queue that we have beyond the 10%. The customers come back, do they have the right to leave or do they stay throughout that entire time. So that's what's going on today. I think an important piece that Tom and I both mentioned that I want everyone to understand, we're not planning for any changes in our plan for the next 5 years that this law will change. So if it does change, these are things that can benefit us, as Tom talked about in his section of the presentation."

If we need to produce more renewable energy or more energy through renewable energy or have energy efficiency, that will be all included in this plan. Now the good news about the law, the way it is today, at least, is not the law, but the bills that are there, is that, that would allow us to go forward and have our capital plans approved to meet the Integrated Resource Plan. And that's the assurance we want, that as we go forward to meet the plan for the Clean Power Plan, which is a federal law, that the state law and the regulation supports us meeting that target. And I think as you know, many of the laws, some of the regulations that EPA has come up with, have been overturned at the last minute. But we don't want that to affect our investments and whether it's the right choice. So the pre-approval process is important to us."

If you look at them in the categories that we laid them out, the 2-way communications, as we called it, which is more mobility, that's something that's going in place now. But you've got to have your systems well coordinated to make that work. So I'll give you an idea around that. Smart meters, in over the next year; and two, we'll have most of our smart meters in, and with that, will come some mobility plus. So that's sort of a time frame where you might see that kind of thing happen. On the grid modernization, I'd push that out a little bit further, because that's better data, better line sensors, better smart meters. So I would go out several years before I would think of that as an opportunity. So you've got one, couple of years from now. Another one, maybe 5 years from now. And then, go down to work management. Now that's one where we'll actually get improvements every month, every quarter, every year, and it'll start slow. It's this simple. I always tell people, when you're changing your process, try this yourself. If you drive a car and you back out of a driveway, and you try to back out and turn the opposite direction of what you normally do, it is very hard to do. I guarantee, if you try to do that over the course of one week, you're going to be wrong, at least a couple of times during that week. So it takes a lot of discipline, a lot of work, and then, a lot of practice to make these things happen. Plus, we need some better systems for our work management, and that's going to take us some time to put in place. So I'd say, you'll see gradual bits of that come in over next year. Small amounts, and then a little bit more than next year. And during the life of 5 years, I think you'll see a lot of that begin to happen. So I'd call that one over 5 years. I'd call technology or the line loss past 5 years, and communication something over the 5-year period. And keep in mind, some of these will end up blending the right into our plans. They'll actually be some of the cost reductions we're talking about. But a lot of these will be incremental, and that's a nice place to be."

I know it's a question you get pretty often in a bunch of different ways, but trying to get a sense of how soon that 6% to 8% might become a target. Would it -- whether be early in the new year, or not until we have a better sense of the nuclear contract, or however, you can help frame up the timing."

Let me just to go back and say again, we're very comfortable with our 5% to 7% growth rate. And what's helped us is, we really balanced the financial performance for the investors with the customer value that they get. So what we're constantly doing is looking at the financial, the operational and the customer side of this business. We think today, for the next several years, there's more opportunity to invest, and I'm talking not only about capital, but O&M, back into customer value and back into operations, just as Tom talked about in the previous question. Here are the truck rolls and some of the things that we need to improve on. That's where, I think, for the next few years we really need to continue to invest and continue to grow at 5% to 7%, which is higher than our peers. What would cause this to change, I think, as Tom said in the slide that's up there right now, you can see if the law goes into effect -- and Tom made a good point I want to emphasize. If the law goes into effect as we expect and there's shortages of capacity in Michigan, which we expect in the future, customers will return to us. But it's not going to happen overnight. And it's going to take time. So we will roll that in as we go forward. But if you looked at that in the future, if the customers' satisfaction continues to be first quartile and the operations continue to be in best-in-class, then there may be a few catalysts that Tom talked about in the out years that would drive us to that. And you saw it there. The PPAs are long term. The retail open access is shorter term than the PPA need to replace those. But that's where I think you ought to think about for us. I mean, our plan is pretty good that we have here today, and there's upsides which we wanted to show you. But right now, we don't want to commit to those yet, because there's more work to do in the base business that we have."

We're trying to demonstrate, short term, if ROA customers came back; and longer term, when we might need to replace those PPAs and we could build gas plants or put in wind farms cheaper than the PPAs. Those are opportunities that we could put in place. And by the way, there were -- those things, I just said, as much as $3 billion. But those are opportunities we could do without hurting the self-funding part, without causing our customers to have bills going up any higher. So that's really the illustration there. Conversations about where we might go beyond 5% to 7%, I think, are something for the future. But we want you to know, we wouldn't go there if we couldn't take care of our customers at the same time."

Thanks for joining us on the call. I missed the last earnings call due to emergency surgery. Now I'm back and feeling good, and I want to thank the management team for doing a great job when I was recovering. Now let's gets to business. I'll begin the call with an update on earnings, provide an operational and legislative update and talk about some recent renewable energy developments, and how those fit into the generation portfolio. And I'll turn the call over to Tom, and we'll discuss -- he'll discuss in greater detail the quarter and additional upsides.
Adjusted earnings per share for the first 9 months were $1.51. This is up $0.09 from last year, or 10% on a weather-adjusted basis. Today, we are raising the bottom end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.01 to a new range of $1.87 to $1.89. This is up 6% to 7% over last year.
In addition, we are introducing 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. This is up 5% to 7%, which supports our consistent and year-over-year predictable performance. 
Here is a view of our past performance and future expectations. Our past earnings performance has been consistent and predictable. We are confident in our plan to achieve the higher end of earnings growth. Further growth upsides, not in our plans plan, include more renewables, new capacity and more investment in our gas system, already one of the largest in the United States, with 1.7 million customers, 29,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipelines and over 300 billion cubic feet of annual deliveries.
Operationally, we continue to have strong performance. Both electric and gas residential customers rate us in the first quartile for customer satisfaction. We continue to leverage our large gas system with low natural gas prices and the largest LDC gas storage system in the country. We have invested more than $400 million in gas transmission and compression in recent years, and our customers are benefiting from that investment. Our customers are paying 60% less for natural gas than a decade ago, creating headroom for additional investments.
Overall, the business operating at a very high level. And we are setting company records in safety, reliability and generation. 
Recently, our Whiting Unit 3 coal plant completed a record continuous run of 679 days. That's the sixth longest ever in the United States. Our major projects continue on schedule. We are seeing better-than-expected results from the Ludington upgrade, smart meters are being very well received by our customers, and we are adding more gas compression. 
In addition to the strong operational results, we've had a string of recent economic development wins. Our strategy has been to partner with state agencies and target companies looking to expand or sight new facilities in Michigan.  As these customers begin operations, we should see an increase in our sales and a lift to the overall economy. 
The update, the Michigan Energy Law, continues to move closer towards the goal line. The Senate and House are closely aligned, and final bills are expected after hearings are completed this month.  Over the next 2 months, we expect committee and full votes from both the Senate and the House. This will allow time for the governor to sign the bill into law by the end of the year. A comprehensive update will help to eliminate unfair subsidies and the Integrated Resource Plan will ensure there are sufficient resources in place to meet the supply needs of our customers and to comply with federal and state environmental regulations. But as a reminder, our long-term plan is based on the existing 2008 Energy Law and not changes to this law. 
We are not waiting for new energy legislation to introduce more renewables into our portfolio. Recently, we signed a competitive wind purchase power agreement. The 100-megawatt contract spans 15 years with an option to purchase. We have broken ground on the state's largest solar garden at Grand Valley State University's campus. By the end of 2016, we plan to have 10 megawatts of utility-scale solar on our system. These additions to our portfolio will increase the renewable energy share beyond the 10% required in the 2008 Energy Law.
With the retirement of 7 coal units next spring, our coal mix will shrink to less than 24% of total capacity by 2017. The addition of the Jackson gas fire plant will add more flexibility, while reducing operating costs. The major expansion at our Ludington pump storage facility also will improve our portfolio.
Overall, we are in a good position to meet the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Although there still is a lot of work to do, we expect Michigan to be fully compliant by the deadline. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss the third quarter results."
257682,285661795,888055,"CMS Energy Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Welcome back. Thank you for joining our call today, everyone. We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today.

We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. 
Our third quarter results at $0.53 a share reflect continued, consistent progress, up $0.16 from a year ago. All business units exceeded plan for a strong quarter. For the first 9 months, earnings at $1.51 a share were up $0.09. And on a weather-normalized basis, earnings were up $0.13 or 10%. 
As you can see here, and as usual, strong performance positions us for delivering the high end of full year guidance. As shown in the dotted circle, cost performance continues to be robust. 
This slide has become popular with many. Higher-than-planned cost reductions and favorable weather provide substantial room for O&M reinvestment. This improves customer reliability, generates incremental productivity and accelerates a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015 [ph]. I just walked the DIG site, and the outage is going very well. The acceleration accomplishes 2 benefits: accelerating the outage cost into 2015, when we have ample room to absorb it; and freeing up capacity in what will be a tight market in 2016.
In addition, you may recall that we'll be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts to 748 megawatts. The impact of this reinvestment in 2015 makes it easier to achieve better reliability and profit next year. 
While we're on the subject of DIG, the old Ferrari in the garage, you can see that the engine's been purring. As capacity prices in Michigan have risen, we've been layering in profitable contracts. Over the next few years, we could exceed our plan by as much as $20 million, and if capacity prices reach the level of Cholla, as much as $40 million. For example, in 2017, about 1/2 of our capacity and 1/4 of our energy is still available. We're discussing a contract now that could use some of this and increase profit by about $15 million to about $35 million in 2017.
The bulk of our growth, of course, comes from our gas and electric utility investments. Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on utility sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. These do, however, create headroom for more capital investment. Our capital investment program over the next 10 years is 45% greater than the last 10 years. That's 45% greater. More than 1/3 of this investment is for gas infrastructure. While many see more convergence, we're fortunate to already have a rich mix of gas in our business.
As a percent of market cap, CMS investment exceeded 10% over the last 10 years. It's at 16% over the next 10. The opportunity to increase investment by another 30% or $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly, when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills. 
Some of the opportunities include capacity for retail open access customers, should they choose to return to bundled service; more renewables; additional gas infrastructure; and replacing PPAs with new generation that will reduce customer bills. 
And many have commented on our model that starts with the customer and enhances results for investors. This organic capital investment program does not include any big bets. It is, however, what drives our earnings growth at 5% to 7%. We're able to self fund much of this growth keeping base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. 
Our 5-year plan includes: O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year; a conservative forecast of sales growth at about 0.5 point a year; the ability to avoid the need for block equity dilution, worth about another point; and other. This self funds 5 points of growth without raising customer rates.
This is a big win-win, with earnings growth at 5% to 7%, and customer rate impacts that stay below inflation. 
Our model is simple. Perhaps, it's a little unique. And we have many capital investment opportunities that just aren't yet in the plan. Most of these can be accomplished without increasing customer bills. For example, replacing PPAs as they expire; and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, provides incremental capital investment without increasing customer bills. Now imagine adding the equivalent of about a new 700-megawatt gas plant every few years for the next 12 years, and that's on top of our plan.
Here is some of the detail around the cost reduction actions, down nearly 3% a year, on average, since 2006. Looking ahead, we don't do it by squeezing a rock. We achieve our reductions with good business decisions. For example, as we switch from coal plants, which require substantial number of people to operate, to gas generation and wind farms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we're able to reduce our O&M by about $35 million. 
For another example, as we lose about 400 workers a year through attrition, new workers are added at a savings of about $40,000 each. This comes from decisions made years ago to bring new hires in with defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit pension programs and on more competitive health care programs. This saves another $35 million. 
While we have a clear plan for how we'll continue our cost reductions in the future, we're working on new ideas. For example, our call centers are too busy. As we introduce better service, billing and emergency mobile applications, we can respond faster and reduce call center workload. This reduces costs. 
Second, new technology will permit us to modernize the grid more efficiently and maintain our systems at a lower cost. A line loss reduction of 1 to 2 points could save $25 million to $50 million. 
And third, as we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time. 
Nearly 1/3 of the time when we roll our trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties that needed to be on-site aren't on time. We are aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. Cost reductions come for free.
Let me take a minute to update you on the economy and sales outlook. Since 2010 through last year, Michigan's GDP is up almost 14%. That's the third best state in the Union. And the largest city that we serve, Grand Rapids, is up 21%. That's among the top 10% of all cities. 
You can see the strong economic data for Grand Rapids compared with Michigan and the U.S. on this slide. We continue, however, to plan sales conservatively to help ensure that this is an area of upside rather than a risk. We project that industrial sales will be up about 2% annually for the next 5 years, with overall sales up about 0.5 point.
With a robust business model, we've been able to able to deliver consistent annual earnings growth of more than 7% for more than a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership, through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you, too, see this is a sustainable model for our customers and investors for a decade ahead.
Now here is our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. You can use this slide for 2016 and 2015. There's not a lot of new news, but we do hear some analysts raise concerns for the sector about interest rates. That's not a surprise in a time of volatile views about interest rates. I know I've been wrong for 10 years in a row. 
It's comforting, however, to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in rates. Higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs. And this excludes a higher return on equity, should rates rise a lot.  
On top of this, our practice includes prefunding parent debt 2 years in advance, larger-than-peer liquidity, and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This further insulates us from risk to changes in interest rates. 
So here is our report card for 2015. We're in a good position, with substantial benefits from the Arctic blast earlier in the year as well as better-than-planned cost reductions. We're putting the surplus to good use, with reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016. 
This will be our 13th year of transparent consistent strong performance. Continuing our mindset that focuses on our customers and other investors permits us to perform well. 
We hope you agree we've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We've got the best cost reduction track record in the nation. Our 13th year of premium earnings includes premium dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. 
So thanks for your interest, and thanks for your support. We'd be delighted to take your questions. 
Operator, would you please open the line."

Right now, I think they're mostly just small adjustments to the bill. There's some issues going on today about retail open access. When they return, how many years they have to have capacity, whether it's 3 years, 5 years. So there's some issues there. And what's the determining factor for if there's a shortfall in Michigan. On the Integrated Resource Plan, I think you're going to see some debate about the difference between having the Integrated Resource Plan and also having a renewable energy standard. So right now, these are just kind of, I would call, adjustments to bring the bills together. We're at the very end of this process, so I'd expect that to happen. But most of it's really revolving around the retail open access. And as the queue continues -- there's a queue that we have beyond the 10%. The customers come back, do they have the right to leave or do they stay throughout that entire time. So that's what's going on today. I think an important piece that Tom and I both mentioned that I want everyone to understand, we're not planning for any changes in our plan for the next 5 years that this law will change. So if it does change, these are things that can benefit us, as Tom talked about in his section of the presentation."

What the legislation will do, we expect, is to support the Integrated Resource Plan. And what I mean by that is to hit the Clean Power Plan target. If we need to produce more renewable energy or more energy through renewable energy or have energy efficiency, that will be all included in this plan. Now the good news about the law, the way it is today, at least, is not the law, but the bills that are there, is that, that would allow us to go forward and have our capital plans approved to meet the Integrated Resource Plan. And that's the assurance we want, that as we go forward to meet the plan for the Clean Power Plan, which is a federal law, that the state law and the regulation supports us meeting that target. And I think as you know, many of the laws, some of the regulations that EPA has come up with, have been overturned at the last minute. But we don't want that to affect our investments and whether it's the right choice. So the pre-approval process is important to us."

So up a little bit one month, down a little bit the next month, sort of flat to down. Industrial has done pretty well, and continues underneath to do very well. But in this year, we got one customer who had an outage that they're coming back very slowly from. Now we don't make a lot of money on this customer because it's a very good rate, but it is still important to us for -- as business. So as they're coming back up, we're probably going to see most of that benefit show up next year than some of it this year, as we had hoped and anticipated. So the outlook that I'm giving you, probably still pretty good where we talk about industrial at 2%, a little bit better, and this is net of energy efficiencies when you look out to 2016. And we're going to tell you, flat to down on residential and commercial, because candidly, they're not picking up like they do out of the typical recovery after a recession. So we're going to plan on 0.5 point growth. We're probably a little conservative, but we'll see how that plays out. We'd rather be there and not be hurt much in our self-funding plans on rates by counting on too much from sales. But good observation. We've been flat, residential commercial. And industrial, which typically would've been up more than you're seeing now, is one heavy user who is just coming back from their outage much slower than they had anticipated."

But net down $100 million, and that's worth 10%. So you can do that math and bring it down a little bit, and think $10 million is about 1%, if that helps a little bit. So then when you think about our self-funding model, we're looking for about 2 points of cost reductions, so 2%. And that, mixed with the other things we have over the next 5 years, keeps us in a position where we could grow as high as 7%. And our customer rates would still be at or below inflation, which we're guessing at roughly 2%. So that gives you some of the math that you can work with. I hope that helps."

If you look at them in the categories that we laid them out, the 2-way communications, as we called it, which is more mobility, that's something that's going in place now. But you've got to have your systems well coordinated to make that work. So I'll give you an idea around that. Smart meters, in over the next year; and two, we'll have most of our smart meters in, and with that will come some mobility plus. So that's sort of a time frame where you might see that kind of thing happen. On the grid modernization, I'd push that out a little bit further, because that's better data, better line sensors, better smart meters. So I would go out several years before I would think of that as an opportunity. So you've got one, couple of years from now. Another one, maybe 5 years from now. And then, go down to work management. Now that's one where we'll actually get improvements every month, every quarter, every year, and it'll start slow. It's this simple. I always tell people, when you're changing your process, try this yourself. If you drive a car and you back out of a driveway, and you try to back out and turn the opposite direction of what you normally do, it is very hard to do. I guarantee, if you try to do that over the course of one week, you're going to be wrong at least a couple of times during that week. So it takes a lot of discipline, a lot of work, and then a lot of practice to make these things happen. Plus, we need some better systems for our work management, and that's going to take us some time to put in place. So I'd say, you'll see gradual bits of that come in over next year. Small amounts, and then a little bit more than next year. And during the life of 5 years, I think you'll see a lot of that begin to happen. So I'd call that one over 5 years. I'd call technology or the line loss past 5 years, and communication something over the 5-year period. And keep in mind, some of these will end up blending right into our plans. They'll actually be some of the cost reductions we're talking about. But a lot of these will be incremental, and that's a nice place to be."

Let me just go back and say again, we're very comfortable with our 5% to 7% growth rate. And what's helped us is, we really balanced the financial performance for investors with the customer value that they get. So what we're constantly doing is looking at the financial, the operational and the customer side of this business. We think today, for the next several years, there's more opportunity to invest, and I'm talking not only about capital, but O&M, back into customer value and back into operations, just as Tom talked about in the previous question. Here are the truck rolls and some of the things that we need to improve on. That's where, I think, for the next few years we really need to continue to invest and continue to grow at 5% to 7%, which is higher than our peers. What would cause this to change, I think, as Tom said in the slide that's up there right now, you can see if the law goes into effect -- and Tom made a good point I want to emphasize. If the law goes into effect as we expect and there's shortages of capacity in Michigan, which we expect in the future, customers will return to us. But it's not going to happen overnight. And it's going to take time. So we will roll that in as we go forward. But if you looked at that in the future, if the customers' satisfaction continues to be first quartile and the operations continue to be in best-in-class, then there may be a few catalysts that Tom talked about in the out years that would drive us to that. And you saw it there. The PPAs are long term. The retail open access is shorter term than the PPA need to replace those. But that's where I think you ought to think about for us. I mean, our plan is pretty good that we have here today, and there's upsides which we wanted to show you. But right now, we don't want to commit to those yet, because there's more work to do in the base business that we have."

Those are opportunities that we could put in place. And by the way, there were -- those things, I just said, as much as $3 billion. But those are opportunities we could do without hurting the self-funding part, without causing our customers to have bills going up any higher. So that's really the illustration there. Conversations about where we might go beyond 5% to 7%, I think, are something for the future.
