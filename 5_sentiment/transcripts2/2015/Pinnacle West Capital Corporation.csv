The fourth quarter ramped up a productivity up and set the stage for further progress in the year ahead. Earnings finished the year in the middle of a range after adjusting for below normal weather. APS's reliability and customers satisfaction remained in the top tier. Safety had another solid year, and Palo Verde set a record for power production. In fact, Palo Verde unit #3 produced the second highest electricity output of any nuclear unit in the world in 2014, and all 3 Palo Verde units individually ranked among the top 6 producers in the United States.
Jim will discuss the 2014 financial results, but first I'll update you on the regulatory progress and discuss a few significant projects. In December, the Arizona Corporation Commission boarded on several key issues, and we appreciate their commitment to resolve these items before the bench turned over.
I'll provide an update on 2 key issues in a moment, but I'd like to first thank commissioners, Brenda Burns and Gary Pierce, whose turns ended in early January. We appreciate their commitment to the state over many years of public service and on driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioners, Douglas Little and Tom Grace were sworn in on the 5th of January to 4-year terms. Commissioner, Susan Bitter Smith was, also, selected by her fellow commissioners as the next chair succeeding commissioner stump, who did a tremendous job leading the commission through a challenging period. Governor, Doug Ducy, was also sworn in, leading a group of many new officials at the state level that are bringing a renewed focus to economic development in Arizona. We look forward to working with Governor, Ducy's team. I will now provide an overview of the key dockets that were boarded on in December at the commission. The Four Corners rate was approved with rates in effect as of January 1 of this year. The $57.1 million rate change was $8 million below our request; however, it was in line with the commission staffs and the administrative low judges recommended order. We were pleased to have a final order in this matter. Separately, the commission voted it had no objection for APS to build and own 10 megawatts of residential rooftop solar on approximately 1,500 homes. Now titled the APS Solar Partner Program, installations will begin in the spring. We've had a great deal of interest from our customers and initiated the first of 3 request for proposals to qualify local Arizona-based installers at the end of January. We're in the process of determining the system and customers to target, which would then be matched up with the selected installers, who will inspect the roofs and install the rooftop systems. 
Putting this program in perspective, as of the end of 2014, APS has 30,000 residential rooftop installations, equating to about 200 megawatts of installed capacity. In 2014, interconnection application volume was down slightly from the record-setting 2013 numbers, but actual installations in 2014 of 7,800 systems was the highest ever, showing a 10% increase over 2013. This robust level of growth causes the unfair cause shift to continue to increase. In addition, the ACC initiated a generic docket in the December -- in December titled, in the matter of the inquiry in the solar DG business models and practices and their impacts on public service corporations and ratepayers. Chairman requested comments by February 13, so the commission and staff are now are reviewing the comments received last week. The next steps in time line for this docket are expected to be discussed at an upcoming commission meeting. We've included a 2015 calendar in our presentation to highlight the key dockets and dates a head of us this year, including the docket I just mentioned.
Let me highlight a few other items. Redesign discussions are surfacing after the initial discussion last fall. We're having discussions with several stakeholders to determine the best path forward. Late last year, solar project proposed a broad restructuring, and it is expected that this will be voted on at their board meeting on February 26. SRP's proposals include several rate design principles that we've been advocating, primarily, better alignment of fixed and variable cost and revenue. While each utility may have a different rate structure, it is clear from the national discussion and here in Arizona, that appropriately addressing the unfair cost shift and aligning the fixed and variable discrepancy are our top priority. The Ocotillo modernization project has moved a year closer to beginning construction, which is expected in 2016. We've been working on the necessary approvals and outreach to the surrounding community and are pleased with the reception we have received.
The certificate of environmental compatibility was approved in November. The last milestone before construction will begin, was raised during the commission's integration resource planning meeting in fall. While there was clear support for the first 2 units, which replaced the existing steam units, questions was raised on the cost effectiveness of the additional 3 units. We have maintained the importance of the 5 units to serve future load growth as well as improve the reliability. However, to address the concerns that were raised, we issued an RFP in late January for incremental capacity equivalent to 3 of the 5 units. This process is expected to conclude in the summer.
One other item to watch is the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision, trans- Canyon, which is our joint venture with BAG U.S. transmission, formerly named, Mid-American transmission, submitted its bid to the California ISO on November 19. In January, the bidder list was disclosed, 6 bidders in total. The Cal-ISO is working through its disqualification and selection process, and we expect the decision this summer.
Lastly, I'll comment on a few recent environmental developments. On December 19, U.S. EPA issued its final regulations governing coal ads, which regulates coal combustion residuals as nonhazardous. Our initial estimate of portion of which is included in our capital forecast, is that our incremental cost to comply will be approximately $100 million, mostly at our Cholla plant. We're, also, working with the Corporation commission, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality known as ADEQ, and the Arizona utilities to encourage the EPA to make revisions to Arizona's requirements under the clean power plant. Under the draft clean power plant, Arizona would be the second most impacted state in the nation. While diverse portfolio is a clear advantage, we're concerned about the impact on other utilities in the state, including the need for additional infrastructure, and the cost to Arizona associated with receiving the boards originally established.
We support the state's efforts to enact legislation that enables ADEQ to submit a state plan to the U.S. EPA. This legislation is necessary to assure EPA does not issue a federal plan for the state of Arizona. Let me conclude by saying I'm very proud of the leadership of our people, again, this year. Ranging from the pursuit of excellence each day across our operations, in the safety of our employees and in the discussion on the complex topic rate design. I expect our team to, again, lead on these efforts in 2015, and that we will deliver on our commitments this year. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

Slide 4 summarizes o",1511,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. Slide 4 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $5.4 million, or $0.05 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $24.3 million or $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $398 million or $3.58 per share compared to net income of $406 million or $3.56 per share for 2013.
Weather-normalized our earnings for 2014 would have been $3.68, and in the middle of our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.75, translating into an earned consolidated ROE of greater than 9.5%. Slide 5 outlines the full year earnings per share drivers compared to 2013. Primary favorable variances include higher gross margin, supported by the various revenue adjustors, and lower interest expense driven by our financing activities and the lower cost and long-term debt. The effects of adverse weather decreased earnings by $0.16 per share. To put the unfavorable effects in perspective, in terms of its impact on megawatt-hours, 2014 was the second modest year in 15 years, including the first quarter of 2014, which was the modest first quarter in 40 years. There was not much variance in the other drivers, including operation and maintenance expenses.
Following on Slide 6. Let me walk through the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.
Lower depreciation and amortization expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, in part due to the Palo Verde unit 2 lease extension we announced in July, offset by additional plant service. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at lower rate. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, largely due to more profitable generation planned outages. A higher effective tax reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, including a prior year tax benefit in the extensive bonus depreciation. The net impact of other items decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.
Turning to Slide 7. In the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. The main components of this were as follows. Lost Fixed Cost Recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.01 per share, which as designed offset some of the impact from energy-efficiency programs and distributed energy. Arizona Sun program benefited earnings by $0.01 per share, primarily, driven by the 32-megawatt solar project that went into service. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Although, weather in both 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters was less favorable than normal, fourth quarter 2014 benefited from a warmer October compared to the same month in 2013.
Prior usage by APS's customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, increased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales after the FX of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and contributed generation, were up 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus 2013. The favorable variance is partly due to the low usage we saw in the fourth quarter in 2013, and was in line with our expectations that where would end the year. The net impact of other miscellaneous items added $0.01 per share.
As a reminder, both the gross margin and variances exclude expenses related to Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustable mechanisms. Also, the referrals are associated with the full transaction and the impacts to our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed, exclude these items, as there was no net impact in 2014 results.
Slide 8 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona is the economy continued a steady improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014. Job growth in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area picked up modestly at the end of the year and for the quarter. Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% rate, as seen on the lower right-hand slide of side -- side of Slide 8. There are services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are each adding jobs in excess of 4% on a year-over-year basis. And most other sectors continue to grow at more modest rate. The job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with a much lower cost structure.
This continued job growth is providing a stable pace of absorption in commercial, office and retail space, yielding a continued decline in vacancy rates in those sectors. As these market tighten up, we expect to see production activity regain steam. As an example, the Phoenix Metro area currently has 2.9 million square feet of office space, currently under construction, most of which will be delivered this year. This is the highest amount of office construction since 2009. Although, the retail sector remains quite, investors place continues to be in high demand with 4 million square feet under construction, primarily, in our West Valley territory. We are, also, seeing continual increases in Metro Phoenix housing demand, although the increase in demand is met largely with multi-family development. Total housing permits and multifamily permits both set cycle highs in 2014 providing their best year since 2007, as you can to see in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies, and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity.
The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question, as largely depend on the greater strength in existing single-family home markets. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continued to increase year-on-year. The recovery in prices reflects the continued absorption of vacant homes, apartments in Metro Phoenix and the normalization of Four Corners sales activity. While existing home prices may not have recovered and not yet new single-family home construction, the apartment market is enjoying lowest vacancy rate, as seen in 15 years. And we believe it is a matter of time before new single-family market moves more decisively in the upward direction. Our balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and a gradually steady recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely that each successive year in the near term will be stronger as we go forward.
We saw a steady improvement in economic conditions, APS discussed in our base grew 1.4% compared with the fourth quarter last year in line with our forecast. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends, I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamental supporting future population and job growth in Arizona appeared to be in place.
Slide 9 outlines our financing activities. On January 12, APS issued $250 million of 5-year 2.20% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowing to replenish cash, temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in 2015, and raise up to $275 million of additional long-term debt, as assumed in our guidance.
Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had a $147 million of commercial paper outstanding. A quick note on pension. Our funding status remain strong at 90%, as of year end 2014, in line with year end 2013. This is due largely to the continued implementation of our liability driven investment strategy. The higher funded status translates to lower long-term funding requirements. Also, in October, the Actuaries issued its final report on mortality tables. We have incorporated a modified version of the mortality assumptions in our pension calculation, which we believe better reflects our employees' demographics. Additional detail is shown on slide included in the appendix of today's presentation.
Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and the financial outlook on Slide 10. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which are unchanged. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

The fourth quarter ramped up a productive year and set the stage for further progress in the year ahead. Earnings finished the year in the middle of the range after adjusting for below normal weather. APS's reliability and customer satisfaction remained in the top tier. Safety had another solid year, and Palo Verde set a record for power production. In fact, Palo Verde Unit #3 produced the second highest electricity output of any nuclear unit in the world in 2014, and all 3 Palo Verde units individually ranked among the top 6 producers in the United States.
Jim will discuss the 2014 financial results, but first I'll update you on the regulatory progress and discuss a few significant projects. In December, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted on several key issues, and we appreciate their commitment to resolve these items before the bench turned over.
I'll provide an update on 2 key issues in a moment but I'd like to first thank Commissioners Brenda Burns and Gary Pierce, whose terms ended in early January. We appreciate their commitment to the state over many years of public service and on driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioners Doug Little and Tom Forese were sworn in on the 5th of January to 4-year terms. Commissioner Susan Bitter Smith was also selected by her fellow commissioners as the next Chair succeeding Commissioner Stump, who did a tremendous job leading the commission through a challenging period. Governor Doug Ducey was also sworn in, leading a group of many new officials at the state level that are bringing a renewed focus to economic development in Arizona. We look forward to working with Governor Ducey's team. 
I'll now provide an overview of the key dockets that were boarded on in December at the commission. The Four Corners rate tariff was approved with rates in effect as of January 1 of this year. The $57.1 million rate change was $8 million below our request, however, it was in line with the commission staffs and the administrative law judges recommended order. We were pleased to have the final order in this matter. Separately, the commission voted it had no objection for APS to build and own 10 megawatts of residential rooftop solar on approximately 1,500 homes. Now titled the APS Solar Partner program, installations will begin in the spring. We've had a great deal of interest from our customers and initiated the first of 3 request for proposals to qualified local Arizona-based installers at the end of January. We're in the process of determining the system feeders and customers to target, which will then be matched up with the selected installers, who will inspect the roofs and install the rooftop systems. 
Putting this program in perspective, as of the end of 2014, APS has 30,000 residential rooftop installations, equating to about 200 megawatts of installed capacity. In 2014, interconnection application volume was down slightly from the record-setting 2013 numbers, but actual installations in 2014 of 7,800 systems was the highest ever, showing a 10% increase over 2013. This robust level of growth causes the unfair cost shift to continue to increase. 
In addition, the ACC initiated a generic docket in the -- in December, titled in the matter of the Inquiry into Solar DG business models and practices in their impacts on public service corporations and ratepayers. Chairman Bitter Smith requested comments by February 13, so the commission and staff are now reviewing the comments received last week. The next steps in time line for this docket are expected to be discussed at an upcoming commission meeting. 
We have included a 2015 calendar in our presentation to highlight the key dockets and dates ahead of us this year, including the docket I just mentioned.
Let me highlight a few other items. Rate-designed discussions are surfacing after the initial discussion last fall. We're having discussions with several stakeholders to determine the best path forward. Late last year, Salt River Project proposed a broad rate restructuring, and it is expected this will be voted on at their board meeting on February 26. SRP's proposal include several rate-designed principles that we have been advocating, primarily, better alignment of fixed and variable costs and revenue. While each utility may have a different rate structure, it is clear from the national discussion and here in Arizona, that appropriately addressing the unfair cost shift and aligning the fixed and variable discrepancy are a top priority. 
The Ocotillo modernization project has moved 1 year closer to beginning construction, which is expected in 2016. We've been working on the necessary approvals and outreach to the surrounding community and are pleased with the reception we have received.
The Certificate of Environmental Compatibility was approved in November. The last milestone before construction will begin was raised during the commission's integration resource planning meeting in the fall. While there was clear support for the first 2 units, which replaced the existing steam units, questions were raised on the cost effectiveness of the additional 3 units. We have maintained the importance of the 5 units to serve future load growth as well as improve the valley's reliability. However, to address the concerns that were raised, we issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity equivalent to 3 of the 5 units. This process is expected to conclude in the summer.
One other item to watch is the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision, TransCanyon, which is our joint venture with BAG U.S. Transmission, formerly named MidAmerican Transmission, submitted its bid to the California ISO on November 19. In January, the bidder list was disclosed, 6 bidders in total. The Cal-ISO is working through its qualification and selection process, and we expect a decision this summer.
Lastly, I'll comment on a few recent environmental developments. On December 19, U.S. EPA issued its final regulations governing coal ash, which regulates coal combustion residuals as nonhazardous. Our initial estimate, a portion of which is included in our capital forecast, is that our incremental cost to comply will be approximately $100 million, mostly at our Cholla plant. We're also working with the Corporation Commission, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, known as ADEQ and the Arizona utilities to encourage the EPA to make revisions to Arizona's requirements under the Clean Power Plan. Under the draft Clean Power Plan, Arizona would be the second most impacted state in the nation. While APS's diverse portfolio is a clear advantage, we are concerned about the impact on other utilities in the state, including the need for additional infrastructure and the cost to Arizonans associated with achieving the goals originally established. We support the state's efforts to enact legislation that enables ADEQ to submit a state plan to U.S. EPA. This legislation is necessary to assure EPA does not issue a federal plan for the state of Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying I'm very proud of the leadership of our people, again, this year. Ranging from the pursuit of excellence each day across our operations, and the safety of our employees and in discussion on the complex topic of rate design. I expect our team to, again, lead on these efforts in 2015, and that we will deliver on our commitments this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. Slide 4 summarizes",1530,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. 
Slide 4 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $5.4 million or $0.05 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $24.3 million or $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $398 million or $3.58 per share, compared to net income of $406 million or $3.66 per share for 2013.
Weather-normalized, our earnings for 2014 would have been $3.68 and in the middle of our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.75, translating into an earned consolidated ROE of greater than 9.5%. 
Slide 5 outlines the full year earnings per share drivers compared to 2013. Primary favorable variances include higher gross margin, supported by the various revenue adjustors; and lower interest expense, driven by our financing activities; and the lower cost of long-term debt. The effects of adverse weather decreased earnings by $0.16 per share. To put the unfavorable weather effects in perspective, in terms of its impact on megawatt-hours, 2014 was the second modest year in 15 years, including the first quarter of 2014, which was the modest first quarter in 40 years. There was not much variance in the other drivers, including operation and maintenance expenses.
Turning on Slide 6. Let me walk through the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Lower depreciation and amortization expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, in part due to the Palo Verde Unit 2 lease extension we announced in July, offset by additional plant in service. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at lower rate. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, largely due to more fossil generation planned outages. A higher effective tax reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, including a prior year tax benefit and the extension of bonus appreciation. The net impact of other items decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.
Turning to Slide 7 and the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. The main components of this were as follows: the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.01 per share, which as designed, offset some of the impact from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy. The Arizona Sun program benefited earnings by $0.01 per share, primarily driven by the 32-megawatt Gila Bend solar project that went into service. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Although weather in both 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters was less favorable than normal, fourth quarter 2014 benefited from a warmer October compared to the same month in 2013.
Prior usage by APS's customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, increased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were up 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus 2013. The favorable variance is partly due to the low usage we saw in the fourth quarter in 2013, and was in line with our expectations at where we would end the year. The net impact of other miscellaneous items added $0.01 per share.
As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction and the impacts to our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed, exclude these items as there was no net impact in 2014 results.
Slide 8 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continued its steady improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014. Job growth in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area picked up modestly at the end of the year and for the quarter. Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% rate, as seen on the lower right-hand slide of Slide -- side of Slide 8. These are services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are each adding jobs in excess of 4% on a year-over-year basis. And most other sectors continue to grow at more modest rates. The job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets but with a much lower cost structure. This continued job growth is providing a stable pace of absorption in commercial, office and retail space, yielding a continual decline in vacancy rates in those sectors. As these markets tighten up, we expect to see construction activity regain steam. As an example, the Phoenix Metro area currently has 2.9 million square feet of office space currently under construction, most of which will be delivered this year. This is the highest amount of office construction since 2009. Although the retail sector remains quiet, investor space continues to be in a high demand with 4 million square feet under construction, primarily in our west Valley territory. We are also seeing continual increases in Metro Phoenix housing demand, although the increase in demand is presently being met largely with multifamily development. Total housing permits and multifamily permits both set cycle highs in 2014 providing their best years since 2007, as you can to see in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity.
The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question. It's largely dependent on degree of strength in the existing single-family home market. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-on-year. The recovery in prices reflects the continual absorption of vacant homes, apartments in Metro Phoenix and the normalization of foreclosure sales activity. While existing home prices may not have recovered and not yet to spur [ph] -- new single-family home construction, the apartment market is enjoying the lowest vacancy rate we have in 15 years, and we believe it is only a matter of time before new single-family market moves more decisively in the upward direction. 
On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and a gradually steady recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely that each successive year in the near term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% compared with the fourth quarter last year in line with our forecast. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population and job growth in Arizona appear to be in place.
Slide 9 outlines our financing activities. On January 12, APS issued $250 million of 5-year 2.20% senior unsecured notes. The proceed from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and to replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in 2015, and raise up to $275 million of additional long-term debt as assumed in our guidance.
Overall, liquidity remained strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had a $147 million of commercial paper outstanding. 
A quick note on pension funded status remained strong at 90% as of year end 2014, in line with year end 2013. This is due largely to the continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy. The higher funded status translates to lower long-term funding requirements. Also in October, the Society of Actuaries issued its final report on mortality tables. We have incorporated a modified version of the mortality assumptions in our pension calculation, which we believe better reflects our employees' demographics. Additional detail is shown on the slide included in the appendix of today's presentation.
Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and the financial outlook on Slide 10. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which are unchanged. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

The fourth quarter ramped up a productive year and set the stage for further progress in the year ahead. Earnings finished the year in the middle of the range after adjusting for below normal weather. APS's reliability and customer satisfaction remained in the top tier. Safety had another solid year, and Palo Verde set a record for power production. In fact, Palo Verde Unit #3 produced the second highest electricity output of any nuclear unit in the world in 2014, and all 3 Palo Verde units individually ranked among the top 6 producers in the United States.
Jim will discuss the 2014 financial results, but first I'll update you on the regulatory progress and discuss a few significant projects. In December, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted on several key issues, and we appreciate their commitment to resolve these items before the bench turned over.
I'll provide an update on 2 key issues in a moment but I'd like to first thank Commissioners Brenda Burns and Gary Pierce, whose terms ended in early January. We appreciate their commitment to the state over many years of public service and on driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioners Doug Little and Tom Forese were sworn in on the 5th of January to 4-year terms. Commissioner Susan Bitter Smith was also selected by her fellow commissioners as the next Chair succeeding Commissioner Stump, who did a tremendous job leading the commission through a challenging period. Governor Doug Ducey was also sworn in, leading a group of many new officials at the state level that are bringing a renewed focus to economic development in Arizona. We look forward to working with Governor Ducey's team. 
I'll now provide an overview of the key dockets that were voted on in December at the commission. The Four Corners rate tariff was approved with rates in effect as of January 1 of this year. The $57.1 million rate change was $8 million below our request, however, it was in line with the commission staffs and the administrative law judges recommended order. We were pleased to have a final order in this matter. Separately, the commission voted it had no objection for APS to build and own 10 megawatts of residential rooftop solar on approximately 1,500 homes. Now titled the APS Solar Partner program, installations will begin in the spring. We've had a great deal of interest from our customers and initiated the first of 3 request for proposals to qualified local Arizona-based installers at the end of January. We're in the process of determining the system feeders and customers to target, which will then be matched up with the selected installers, who will inspect the roofs and install the rooftop systems. 
Putting this program in perspective, as of the end of 2014, APS has 30,000 residential rooftop installations, equating to about 200 megawatts of installed capacity. In 2014, interconnection application volume was down slightly from the record-setting 2013 numbers, but actual installations in 2014 of 7,800 systems was the highest ever, showing a 10% increase over 2013. This robust level of growth causes the unfair cost shift to continue to increase. 
In addition, the ACC initiated a generic docket in the -- in December, titled in the matter of the Inquiry into Solar DG business models and practices and their impacts on public service corporations and ratepayers. Chairman Bitter Smith requested comments by February 13, so the commission and staff are now reviewing the comments received last week. The next steps and time line for this docket are expected to be discussed at an upcoming commission meeting. 
We have included a 2015 calendar in our presentation to highlight the key dockets and dates ahead of us this year, including the docket I just mentioned.
Let me highlight a few other items. Rate-designed discussions are surfacing after the initial discussion last fall. We're having discussions with several stakeholders to determine the best path forward. Late last year, Salt River Project proposed a broad rate restructuring, and it is expected this will be voted on at their board meeting on February 26. SRP's proposal include several rate-designed principles that we have been advocating, primarily, better alignment of fixed and variable costs and revenue. While each utility may have a different rate structure, it is clear from the national discussion and here in Arizona, that appropriately addressing the unfair cost shift and aligning the fixed and variable discrepancy are a top priority. 
The Ocotillo modernization project has moved a year closer to beginning construction, which is expected in 2016. We've been working on the necessary approvals and outreach to the surrounding community and are pleased with the reception we have received.
The Certificate of Environmental Compatibility was approved in November. The last milestone before construction will begin was raised during the commission's integration resource planning meeting in the fall. While there was clear support for the first 2 units, which replaced the existing steam units, questions were raised on the cost effectiveness of the additional 3 units. We have maintained the importance of the 5 units to serve future load growth as well as improve the valley's reliability. However, to address the concerns that were raised, we issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity equivalent to 3 of the 5 units. This process is expected to conclude in the summer.
One other item to watch is the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision, TransCanyon, which is our joint venture with BAG U.S. Transmission, formerly named MidAmerican Transmission, submitted its bid to the California ISO on November 19. In January, the bidder list was disclosed, 6 bidders in total. The Cal-ISO is working through its qualification and selection process, and we expect a decision this summer.
Lastly, I'll comment on a few recent environmental developments. On December 19, U.S. EPA issued its final regulations governing coal ash, which regulates coal combustion residuals as nonhazardous. Our initial estimate, a portion of which is included in our capital forecast, is that our incremental cost to comply will be approximately $100 million, mostly at our Cholla plant. We're also working with the Corporation Commission, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, known as ADEQ and the Arizona utilities to encourage the EPA to make revisions to Arizona's requirements under the Clean Power Plan. Under the draft Clean Power Plan, Arizona would be the second most impacted state in the nation. While APS's diverse portfolio is a clear advantage, we are concerned about the impact on other utilities in the state, including the need for additional infrastructure and the cost to Arizonans associated with achieving the goals originally established. We support the state's efforts to enact legislation that enables ADEQ to submit a state plan to U.S. EPA. This legislation is necessary to assure EPA does not issue a federal plan for the state of Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying I'm very proud of the leadership of our people, again, this year, ranging from the pursuit of excellence each day across our operations, and the safety of our employees and in discussion on the complex topic of rate design. I expect our team to again lead on these efforts in 2015, and that we will deliver on our commitments this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. Slide 4 summarizes",1527,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. 
Slide 4 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $5.4 million or $0.05 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $24.3 million or $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $398 million or $3.58 per share, compared to net income of $406 million or $3.66 per share for 2013.
Weather-normalized, our earnings for 2014 would have been $3.68 and in the middle of our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.75, translating into an earned consolidated ROE of greater than 9.5%. 
Slide 5 outlines the full year earnings per share drivers compared to 2013. Primary favorable variances include higher gross margin, supported by the various revenue adjustors; and lower interest expense, driven by our financing activities; and the lower cost of long-term debt. The effects of adverse weather decreased earnings by $0.16 per share. To put the unfavorable weather effects in perspective, in terms of its impact on megawatt-hours, 2014 was the second mildest year in 15 years, including the first quarter of 2014, which was the modest first quarter in 40 years. There was not much variance in the other drivers, including operation and maintenance expenses.
Turning on Slide 6. Let me walk through the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Lower depreciation and amortization expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, in part due to the Palo Verde Unit 2 lease extension we announced in July, offset by additional plant in service. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at a lower rate. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, largely due to more fossil generation planned outages. A higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, including a prior year tax benefit and the extension of bonus appreciation. The net impact of other items decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.
Turning to Slide 7 and the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. The main components of this were as follows: the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.01 per share, which as designed, offset some of the impact from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy. The Arizona Sun program benefited earnings by $0.01 per share, primarily driven by the 32-megawatt Gila Bend solar project that went into service. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Although weather in both 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters was less favorable than normal, fourth quarter 2014 benefited from a warmer October compared to the same month in 2013.
Prior usage by APS's customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, increased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were up 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus 2013. The favorable variance is partly due to the low usage we saw in the fourth quarter in 2013, and was in line with our expectations at where we would end the year. The net impact of other miscellaneous items added $0.01 per share.
As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction and the impacts to our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed, exclude these items as there was no net impact in 2014 results.
Slide 8 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continued its steady improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014. Job growth in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area picked up modestly at the end of the year and for the quarter. Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% rate, as seen on the lower right-hand slide of Slide -- side of Slide 8. These are services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are each adding jobs in excess of 4% on a year-over-year basis. And most other sectors continue to grow at more modest rates. The job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets but with a much lower cost structure. This continued job growth is providing a stable pace of absorption in commercial, office and retail space, yielding a continual decline in vacancy rates in those sectors. As these markets tighten up, we expect to see construction activity regain steam. As an example, the Phoenix Metro area currently has 2.9 million square feet of office space currently under construction, most of which will be delivered this year. This is the highest amount of office construction since 2009. Although the retail sector remains quiet, industrial space continues to be in a high demand with 4 million square feet under construction, primarily in our West Valley territory. We are also seeing continual increases in Metro Phoenix housing demand, although the increase in demand is presently being met largely with multifamily development. Total housing permits and multifamily permits both set cycle highs in 2014 providing their best years since 2007, as you can see in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity.
The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question. It's largely dependent on degree of strength in the existing single-family home market. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-on-year. The recovery in prices reflects the continual absorption of vacant homes, apartments in Metro Phoenix and the normalization of foreclosure sales activity. While existing home prices may not have recovered and have yet to spur new single-family home construction, the apartment market is enjoying the lowest vacancy rate we have seen in 15 years, and we believe it is only a matter of time before new single-family market moves more decisively in the upward direction. 
On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and a gradually steady recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely that each successive year in the near term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% compared with the fourth quarter last year in line with our forecast. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population and job growth in Arizona appear to be in place.
Slide 9 outlines our financing activities. On January 12, APS issued $250 million of 5-year 2.20% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and to replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in 2015, and raise up to $275 million of additional long-term debt as assumed in our guidance.
Overall, liquidity remained strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $147 million of commercial paper outstanding. 
A quick note on pension. Funded status remained strong at 90% as of yearend 2014, in line with yearend 2013. This is due largely to the continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy. The higher funded status translates to lower long-term funding requirements. Also in October, the Society of Actuaries issued its final report on mortality tables. We have incorporated a modified version of the mortality assumptions in our pension calculation, which we believe better reflects our employees' demographics. Additional detail is shown on the slide included in the appendix of today's presentation.
Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and the financial outlook on Slide 10. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which are unchanged. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

The fourth quarter ramped up a productive year and set the stage for further progress in the year ahead. Earnings finished the year in the middle of the range after adjusting for below normal weather. APS's reliability and customer satisfaction remained in the top tier. Safety had another solid year, and Palo Verde set a record for power production. In fact, Palo Verde Unit #3 produced the second highest electricity output of any nuclear unit in the world in 2014, and all 3 Palo Verde units individually ranked among the top 6 producers in the United States.
Jim will discuss the 2014 financial results, but first I'll update you on the regulatory progress and discuss a few significant projects. In December, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted on several key issues, and we appreciate their commitment to resolve these items before the bench turned over.
I'll provide an update on 2 key issues in a moment but I'd like to first thank Commissioners Brenda Burns and Gary Pierce, whose terms ended in early January. We appreciate their commitment to the state over many years of public service and on driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioners Doug Little and Tom Forese were sworn in on the 5th of January to 4-year terms. Commissioner Susan Bitter Smith was also selected by her fellow commissioners as the next Chair succeeding Commissioner Stump, who did a tremendous job leading the commission through a challenging period. Governor Doug Ducey was also sworn in, leading a group of many new officials at the state level that are bringing a renewed focus to economic development in Arizona. We look forward to working with Governor Ducey's team. 
I'll now provide an overview of the key dockets that were voted on in December at the commission. The Four Corners rate tariff was approved with rates in effect as of January 1 of this year. The $57.1 million rate change was $8 million below our request, however, it was in line with the commission staffs and the administrative law judges recommended order. We were pleased to have a final order in this matter. Separately, the commission voted it had no objection for APS to build and own 10 megawatts of residential rooftop solar on approximately 1,500 homes. Now titled the APS Solar Partner program, installations will begin in the spring. We've had a great deal of interest from our customers and initiated the first of 3 request for proposals to qualified local Arizona-based installers at the end of January. We're in the process of determining the system feeders and customers to target, which will then be matched up with the selected installers, who will inspect the roofs and install the rooftop systems. 
Putting this program in perspective, as of the end of 2014, APS has 30,000 residential rooftop installations, equating to about 200 megawatts of installed capacity. In 2014, interconnection application volume was down slightly from the record-setting 2013 numbers, but actual installations in 2014 of 7,800 systems was the highest ever, showing a 10% increase over 2013. This robust level of growth causes the unfair cost shift to continue to increase. 
In addition, the ACC initiated a generic docket in the -- in December, titled in the matter of the Inquiry into Solar DG business models and practices and their impacts on public service corporations and ratepayers. Chairman Bitter Smith requested comments by February 13, so the commission and staff are now reviewing the comments received last week. The next steps and time line for this docket are expected to be discussed at an upcoming commission meeting. 
We have included a 2015 calendar in our presentation to highlight the key dockets and dates ahead of us this year, including the docket I just mentioned.
Let me highlight a few other items. Rate-designed discussions are surfacing after the initial discussion last fall. We're having discussions with several stakeholders to determine the best path forward. Late last year, Salt River Project proposed a broad rate restructuring, and it is expected this will be voted on at their board meeting on February 26. SRP's proposal include several rate-designed principles that we have been advocating, primarily, better alignment of fixed and variable costs and revenue. While each utility may have a different rate structure, it is clear from the national discussion and here in Arizona, that appropriately addressing the unfair cost shift and aligning the fixed and variable discrepancy are a top priority. 
The Ocotillo modernization project has moved a year closer to beginning construction, which is expected in 2016. We've been working on the necessary approvals and outreach to the surrounding community and are pleased with the reception we have received.
The Certificate of Environmental Compatibility was approved in November. The last milestone before construction will begin was raised during the commission's integration resource planning meeting in the fall. While there was clear support for the first 2 units, which replaced the existing steam units, questions were raised on the cost effectiveness of the additional 3 units. We have maintained the importance of the 5 units to serve future load growth as well as improve the valley's reliability. However, to address the concerns that were raised, we issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity equivalent to 3 of the 5 units. This process is expected to conclude in the summer.
One other item to watch is the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision, TransCanyon, which is our joint venture with BAG U.S. Transmission, formerly named MidAmerican Transmission, submitted its bid to the California ISO on November 19. In January, the bidder list was disclosed, 6 bidders in total. The Cal-ISO is working through its qualification and selection process, and we expect a decision this summer.
Lastly, I'll comment on a few recent environmental developments. On December 19, U.S. EPA issued its final regulations governing coal ash, which regulates coal combustion residuals as nonhazardous. Our initial estimate, a portion of which is included in our capital forecast, is that our incremental cost to comply will be approximately $100 million, mostly at our Cholla plant. We're also working with the Corporation Commission, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, known as ADEQ and the Arizona utilities to encourage the EPA to make revisions to Arizona's requirements under the Clean Power Plan. Under the draft Clean Power Plan, Arizona would be the second most impacted state in the nation. While APS's diverse portfolio is a clear advantage, we are concerned about the impact on other utilities in the state, including the need for additional infrastructure and the cost to Arizonans associated with achieving the goals originally established. We support the state's efforts to enact legislation that enables ADEQ to submit a state plan to U.S. EPA. This legislation is necessary to assure EPA does not issue a federal plan for the state of Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying I'm very proud of the leadership of our people, again, this year, ranging from the pursuit of excellence each day across our operations, and the safety of our employees and in discussion on the complex topic of rate design. I expect our team to again lead on these efforts in 2015, and that we will deliver on our commitments this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. Slide 4 summarizes",1527,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activities and a review of our earnings guidance. 
Slide 4 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $5.4 million or $0.05 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $24.3 million or $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $398 million or $3.58 per share, compared to net income of $406 million or $3.66 per share for 2013.
Weather-normalized, our earnings for 2014 would have been $3.68 and in the middle of our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.75, translating into an earned consolidated ROE of greater than 9.5%. 
Slide 5 outlines the full year earnings per share drivers compared to 2013. Primary favorable variances include higher gross margin, supported by the various revenue adjustors; and lower interest expense, driven by our financing activities; and the lower cost of long-term debt. The effects of adverse weather decreased earnings by $0.16 per share. To put the unfavorable weather effects in perspective, in terms of its impact on megawatt-hours, 2014 was the second mildest year in 15 years, including the first quarter of 2014, which was the modest first quarter in 40 years. There was not much variance in the other drivers, including operation and maintenance expenses.
Turning on Slide 6. Let me walk through the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Lower depreciation and amortization expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, in part due to the Palo Verde Unit 2 lease extension we announced in July, offset by additional plant in service. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at a lower rate. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, largely due to more fossil generation planned outages. A higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, including a prior year tax benefit and the extension of bonus appreciation. The net impact of other items decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.
Turning to Slide 7 and the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. The main components of this were as follows: the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.01 per share, which as designed, offset some of the impact from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy. The Arizona Sun program benefited earnings by $0.01 per share, primarily driven by the 32-megawatt Gila Bend solar project that went into service. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Although weather in both 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters was less favorable than normal, fourth quarter 2014 benefited from a warmer October compared to the same month in 2013.
Prior usage by APS's customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, increased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were up 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus 2013. The favorable variance is partly due to the low usage we saw in the fourth quarter in 2013, and was in line with our expectations at where we would end the year. The net impact of other miscellaneous items added $0.01 per share.
As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction and the impacts to our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed, exclude these items as there was no net impact in 2014 results.
Slide 8 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continued its steady improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014. Job growth in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area picked up modestly at the end of the year and for the quarter. Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% rate, as seen on the lower right-hand slide of Slide -- side of Slide 8. These are services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are each adding jobs in excess of 4% on a year-over-year basis. And most other sectors continue to grow at more modest rates. The job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets but with a much lower cost structure. This continued job growth is providing a stable pace of absorption in commercial, office and retail space, yielding a continual decline in vacancy rates in those sectors. As these markets tighten up, we expect to see construction activity regain steam. As an example, the Phoenix Metro area currently has 2.9 million square feet of office space currently under construction, most of which will be delivered this year. This is the highest amount of office construction since 2009. Although the retail sector remains quiet, industrial space continues to be in a high demand with 4 million square feet under construction, primarily in our West Valley territory. We are also seeing continual increases in Metro Phoenix housing demand, although the increase in demand is presently being met largely with multifamily development. Total housing permits and multifamily permits both set cycle highs in 2014 providing their best years since 2007, as you can see in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity.
The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question. It's largely dependent on degree of strength in the existing single-family home market. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-on-year. The recovery in prices reflects the continual absorption of vacant homes, apartments in Metro Phoenix and the normalization of foreclosure sales activity. While existing home prices may not have recovered and have yet to spur new single-family home construction, the apartment market is enjoying the lowest vacancy rate we have seen in 15 years, and we believe it is only a matter of time before new single-family market moves more decisively in the upward direction. 
On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and a gradually steady recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely that each successive year in the near term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% compared with the fourth quarter last year in line with our forecast. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population and job growth in Arizona appear to be in place.
Slide 9 outlines our financing activities. On January 12, APS issued $250 million of 5-year 2.20% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and to replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in 2015, and raise up to $275 million of additional long-term debt as assumed in our guidance.
Overall, liquidity remained strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $147 million of commercial paper outstanding. 
A quick note on pension. Funded status remained strong at 90% as of yearend 2014, in line with yearend 2013. This is due largely to the continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy. The higher funded status translates to lower long-term funding requirements. Also in October, the Society of Actuaries issued its final report on mortality tables. We have incorporated a modified version of the mortality assumptions in our pension calculation, which we believe better reflects our employees' demographics. Additional detail is shown on the slide included in the appendix of today's presentation.
Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and the financial outlook on Slide 10. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which are unchanged. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Despite mild weather, we're off to another solid start this year. Our operations are running well and preparing for the summer peak. nuclear generating Station continues to deliver excellent results",973,"Thanks, Paul, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Despite mild weather, we're off to another solid start this year. Our operations are running well and preparing for the summer peak. nuclear generating Station continues to deliver excellent results and is also preparing for the summer with unit 3 and a planned refueling outage that began Easter weekend. Before Jim discusses the first quarter results and our updated financial outlook, there are few regulatory and strategic developments I will update you on. First, rate design continues to be a priority for APS, and it is so increasingly across the country. We have seen progressive steps in other states as well as by our peer utilities here in Arizona. Solar projects board approved a broad rate design change in February, while Tyco, sulfur Springs, Unisource and filed for NetMeeting related changes earlier this year. The steps utility is taking batteries, but appropriately addressing the cost shift and lining the fixed and variable cost discrepancy as a top priority. On April 2, APS asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to increase the grid access charge for future residential solar customer from $0.70 per kilowatt to $3 per kilowatt, or approximately $21 per month. We've asked the ASC that's effective August 1. In its 2013 decision, the ACC found that in interim monthly charge of $3 per kilowatt was reasonable to cover the cost to operate and maintain the electric grid, but decided to begin with a smaller charge of $0.70 per kilowatt and monitor the issue. APS is simply asking the commission to implement its 2013 decision. Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but it's rather intended to be in interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case or another preceding.
Look agrees that interim solution should be approved to help mitigate some of the cost shift before the issue can be dealt with more fully in a rate case. New solar customers would have the option of selecting an existing rate that includes the demand charge. Other components of the future grate design would include use of the demand charts on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of use data structures. Since 2013 rooftop solar has seen steady growth. Now over 31,000 customers in our service territories have a rooftop solar system installed. This level of activity reinforces our commitment to modernizing our grid and updating our pricing structures to get customers the platform they need to support the different types of energy and services they want. Our APS solar partner program where APS will be installing and owning rooftop solar on about 1500 homes equal to about 10 megawatts is now being rolled out. We've completed 2 of the 3 scheduled RFPs to select the Arizona-based companies that will be installing the systems, and we have began soliciting customers on the first group of feeders we've chosen for the program. This innovative program allows us to partner with the Electric Power Research Institute to conduct research on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. In working with various stakeholder groups for this pilot, including the Arizona solar deployment alliance, which represents Arizona-based solar installers, we're helping Arizona maintain its solar leadership, while ensuring our customers are served well. Our utilities scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 projects under construction in the Phoenix Metro area that will bring that program to 170 megawatts. Those projects are expected to be online this summer. In fact, our AZ Sun Program has largely contributed to another strong showing by APS and Arizona in the Solar Electric Power Association annual utilities solar rankings that were published this week. APS was ranked in the top 5 in 4 categories, including cumulative megawatts and annual and cumulative interconnections. The Ocotillo modernization project is an important investment to maintain reliability in the valley and support the growth in renewable generation.
We issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity at our Ocotillo peaking facility equivalent to 3 of the 5 new units. This was received in March and evaluated. The RFP affirmed that APS's bid at the existing Ocotillo site is most cost effective. Additionally, our analysis of the project, which was reflected in a bid determined that it was optimal from a customer impact standpoint, that has a project completed in 2019 instead of 2018. And Jim will discuss the financial implications of this change. There are a couple of transmissional related items to update you on also. First, we recently completed construction of, what we call, Hank 2 line or the output in north 2 500 kV transmission line. The project remains on schedule and is expected to be enerzined in the second quarter this year. After testing and commissioning of both the switch yards in the north substation is complete. In total, the 112-mile long line in Yuma required construction of 390 steel towers through some extremely terrains. It's a very important project for our company to meet our customer's energy needs in southwestern Arizona. And second, Delaney-Colorado transmission line decision is expected by the California ISO this summer. During the bidding collaboration period, TransCanyon and Southern California Edison submitted a joint proposal to the Cal-ISO for this project that replaces the individual bits, both parties submitted November of last year. The collaboration brings together the experience expertise and proven track record number each organization has in their respective states, TransCanyon and Arizona and Southern California Edison in California. Let me conclude by saying that our focus will continue to be to make decisions and investments that position APS in Arizona for sustainable success in a changing energy world. I will now -- excuse me, turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included a discussion for our financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ong",1308,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included a discussion for our financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16.1 million or $0.14 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $15.8 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter of 2014. Slide 4 outlines a very interest in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, largely due to Fossil Generation plant outages. Our depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This variance includes the absence of the 2014 cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the cost associated with the acquisition price.
G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant service. These higher costs were partially offset by the unit to lease extension we announced in July of last year. As included in our guidance, G&A will be higher all year largely due to Four Corners. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinanced long-term debt at a lower rate.
Turning to Slide 5 and the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. Collectively, the revenue adjustors continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin out design, including the Four Corners rate change that went to effect on January 1 and contributed $0.06 per share. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily, D&A DNA, which I mentioned earlier. The effective weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Although, weather in both 2015 and 2014 first quarters were less favorable than normal, the first quarter 2015 benefited from an unseasonably warm March compared to the same month in 2014. While residential heating degree-days, a measure of the effects of weather were 6% higher than last year's first quarter, heating degree-days were 51% below normal senior averages. As a result, weather negatively impacted 2015 first quarter by $0.06 per share compared with, historically, normal conditions.
Lower usage by APS customers compared with the first quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conversation and distribution generation, were down 8 tenths of 1% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014. The exploration of long-term wholesale contract at the end of 2014, which is included in guidance, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. There will be a similar variance each quarter this year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar the greater programs, all of which offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms. Also the impact of our noncontrolling interest for the polymer dailies extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed, exclude these items as there was no net impact on first quarter results.
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much likely in the past several quarters. Job growth in Arizona in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 15 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% year-over-year rate in the first quarter, the fastest rate of job growth since Q4 2006.
Notably, this job growth has occurred without relying on the construction sector. Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth and highlighted diversity of Arizona's economy. Additionally, several sources have recently raised the greater Phoenix area as one of the top places for small business and entrepreneurs. The environment for small business startups is very strong. As indicated before, we believe the job growth we're seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with a much lower cost structure. Of the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, the Phoenix Metro area rated second in publishing growth in 2014. This healthy population job growth is providing continued support for an improved real estate market. As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates for Marshall space continue to add down, and activity in the sectors has picked up with 2.8 million square foot of industrial space and 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction in the first quarter of 2015.
Residential housing demand and Metro Phoenix also continues to increase. As I mentioned on our last call, the increase in demand is, primarily, being met by multifamily development. Housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity. The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question, and is largely dependent on the degree of strength in the existing single-family home market. As you can see in the panel of the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from the recession lows and continue to increase year-over-year. The recovery in prices and rents reflects the continual absorption of vacant homes and apartments in Metro Phoenix. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and continue to recovery. We expect each successive year in the near term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.2% compared with the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support, future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 and $3.95 per share. The rated adjustors and cost management remained important drivers. A completeness of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 7, which are unchanged from our last confirmation to guidance.
Looking ahead to 2015 debt issuance, we plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in the second quarter and raise up to $325 million of additional long-term debt as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $45 million of commercial paper outstanding, included in the Phoenix today's presentation on our updated capital expenditures in rate-based slides. Based on our revised projections, the total CapEx for the Ocotillo modernization project is now about $500 million, which reflects a 2019 service day in a refined estimate from our previous total of $600 million to $700 million. Our rate base growth outlook is still 6% to 7%. As we continue to refine our forecast, we currently expect the equity component of the capital structure for APS will be approximately 54% at the end of this year. Therefore, we'll not need to issue equity to support the capital structure for this rate cycle. We now forecast that we'll not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

And so we've stayed within that framework and went up to the level of the great access charge that was supported in the decision, which was the $3 a lot level. All that is when that revenues are collected under that, they going into balancing account that reduces the amount of cost ship, and that basically offsets about 4x the cost shift that we're seeing today. That's different from the structural rate design issues, which is a more long-term issue. And so that we expect to be addressed in the rate case. And we expect to be continued discussions around rate designs as we lead that to the rate case. And you also seeing now more debate around the region, California has got a proposed decision out. All those are talking about the long-term. The long-term ways to address the cost issue, but that's very different from the grid access charge.

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station continues to deliver excellent results and is also preparing for the summer with Unit 3 in a planned refueling outage that began Easter weekend. 
Before Jim discusses the first quarter results and our updated financial outlook, there are few regulatory and strategic developments I will update you on. First, rate design continues to be a priority for APS and it is so increasingly across the country. We have seen progressive steps in other states as well as by our peer utilities here in Arizona. Salt River Project's Board approved a broad-rate design change in February, while Trico, Sulphur Springs, UniSource and TEP, all filed for net metering-related changes earlier this year. The steps each utility is taking varies, but appropriately addressing the cost shift and lining the fixed and variable cost discrepancy as a top priority. On April 2, APS asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to increase the grid access charge for future residential solar customer from $0.70 per kilowatt to $3 per kilowatt or approximately $21 per month. We've asked the ACC to have this effective August 1. In its 2013 decision, the ACC found that an interim monthly charge of $3 per kilowatt was reasonable to cover the cost to operate and maintain the electric grid, but decided to begin with a smaller charge of $0.70 per kilowatt and monitor the issue. APS is simply asking the Commission to implement its 2013 decision. Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but is rather intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case or another preceding.
RUCO agrees that this interim solution should be approved to help mitigate some of the cost shift before the issue can be dealt with more fully in a rate case. New solar customers would have the option of selecting an existing rate that includes the demand charge. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of used rate structures. Since 2013, rooftop solar has seen steady growth. Now over 31,000 customers in our service territories have a rooftop solar system installed. This level of activity reinforces our commitment to modernizing our grid and updating our pricing structures to give customers the platform they need to support the different types of energy and services they want. Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning rooftop solar on about 1,500 homes equaled to about 10 megawatts, is now being rolled out. We've completed 2 of the 3 scheduled RFPs to select the Arizona-based companies that will be installing the systems. And we began soliciting customers on the first group of feeders we've chosen for the program. This innovative program allows us to partner with the Electric Power Research Institute to conduct research on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. In working with various stakeholder groups for this pilot, including the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance, which represents Arizona-based solar installers, we're helping Arizona maintain its solar leadership while ensuring our customers are served well. Our utilities scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 projects under construction in the Phoenix Metro area that will bring that program to 170 megawatts. Those projects are expected to be online this summer. In fact, our AZ Sun Program has largely contributed to another strong showing by APS and Arizona in the Solar Electric Power Association Annual Utilities Solar Rankings that were published this week. APS was ranked in the top 5 in 4 categories, including cumulative megawatts and annual and cumulative interconnections. The Ocotillo modernization project is an important investment to maintain reliability in the valley and support the growth in renewable generation.
We issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity at our Ocotillo peaking facility, equivalent to 3 of the 5 new units. Bids were received in March and have been evaluated. The RFP affirmed that APS's bid at the existing Ocotillo site is the most cost effective. Additionally, our analysis of the project, which was reflected in the bid, determined that it was optimal from a customer-impact standpoint. That has a project completed in 2019, instead of 2018. And Jim will discuss the financial implications of this change. There are a couple of transmission-related items to update you on also. First, we recently completed construction of the, what we call, HANG2 line, or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2, 500 kV transmission line. The project remains on schedule and is expected to be energized in the second quarter this year after testing and commissioning of both the Hassayampa switchyard and the North Gila substation is complete. In total, the 112-mile long line in the Yuma required construction of 390 steel towers through some extremely difficult terrains. This is a very important project for our company to meet customers' energy needs in southwestern Arizona. 
And second, Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision is expected by the California ISO this summer. During the bidding collaboration period, TransCanyon and Southern California Edison submitted a joint proposal to the Cal-ISO for this project. That replaces the individual bids, both parties submitted in November of last year. The collaboration brings together the experience expertise and proven-track record each organization has in their respective states, TransCanyon in Arizona; and Southern California Edison in California. 
Let me conclude by saying that our focus will continue to be -- to make decisions and investments that position APS in Arizona for sustainable success in a changing energy world. 
I will now -- excuse me, turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included first quarter's financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoin",1313,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included first quarter's financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16.1 million or $0.14 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $15.8 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter of 2014. Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, largely due to Fossil Generation planned outages. Our depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price.
G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. These higher costs were partially offset by the Palo Verde Unit to lease extension we announced in July of last year. As included in our guidance, G&A will be higher all year largely due to Four Corners. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinanced long-term debt at a lower rate.
Turning to Slide 5 and the components of it. Net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. Collectively, the revenue adjustors continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, including the Four Corners rate change that went to effect on January 1 and contributed $0.06 per share. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily, D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effective weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Although weather on both 2015 and 2014 first quarters were less favorable than normal, the first quarter 2015 benefited from an unseasonably warm March compared to the same month in 2014. While residential heating degree-days, a measure of the effects of weather, were 6% higher than last year's first quarter. Heating degree-days were 51% below normal 10-year averages. As a result, weather negatively impacted 2015 first quarter by $0.06 per share compared with, historically, normal conditions.
Lower usage by APS customers compared with the first quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conversation and distributed generation, were down 0.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014. The exploration of a long-term wholesale contract at the end of 2014, which is included in guidance, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. There will be a similar variance each quarter this year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms. Also, the impact of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers, I discussed, exclude these items as there was no net impact on first quarter results.
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much likely it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in the Arizona in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 15 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% year-over-year rate in the first quarter, the fastest rate of job growth since Q4 2006.
Notably, this job growth has occurred without relying on the construction sector. Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth and highlight the diversity of Arizona's economy. Additionally, several sources have recently raised the Greater Phoenix area as one of the top places for small business and entrepreneurs. The environment for small business startups is very strong. As I indicated before, we believe that job growth we're seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with a much lower cost structure. Of the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, the Phoenix Metro area ranks second in population growth in 2014. This healthy population job growth is providing continued support for an improved real estate market. As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates for commercial space continue to edge down. And activity in these sectors has picked up with 2.8 million square foot of industrial space and 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction in the first quarter of 2015.
Residential housing demand and Metro Phoenix also continues to increase. As I mentioned on our last call, the increase in demand is, primarily, being met by multi-family development. Housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies, and believe that these trends will translate into the higher overall housing activity. The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question, and is largely dependent on the degree of strength in the existing single-family home markets. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-over-year. The recovery in prices and rents reflects a continual absorption of vacant homes and apartments in Metro Phoenix. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and continued recovery. We expect each successive year in the near-term will be stronger, as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.2% compared with the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support, future population, job growth and economic development in the Arizona appeared to be in place.
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 and $3.95 per share. The rated adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 7, which are unchanged from our last confirmation to guidance.
Looking ahead to 2015 debt issuance. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in the second quarter and raise up to $325 million of additional long-term debt, as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $45 million of commercial paper outstanding. Included in the appendix, today's presentation are our updated capital expenditures in rate-based slides. Based on our revised projections, the total CapEx for the Ocotillo modernization project is now about $500 million, which reflects a 2019 in-service date and a refined estimate from our previous total of $600 million to $700 million. Our rate-base growth outlook is still 6% to 7%. As we continue to refine our forecast, we currently expect the equity component of the capital structure for APS will be approximately 54% at the end of this year. Therefore, we'll not need to issue equity to support the capital structure for this rate cycle. We now forecast that we'll not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. 
Operator, we'll now take questions."

One of the things to consider with that, is when we went to the $0.70 charge, that was static. And there was originally a proposal in the recommended order they were considering the time they would step that up as installations continued and we continued to meet the distributed energy carve out in the RPS. And essentially, if we've to follow that, if that would have been adopted, and we've to follow that, we would be at the $3 charge. So the challenge right now is that when you don't adjust that charge and you've got no upfront incentives, every time there's a cost reduction on the installed cost of solar, we're not able to capture that. And so we're paying too much today for the solar that's going in our territory."

And so we stayed within that frame work and went up to the level of a great access charge that was supported in that decision, which was the $3 a lot level. All that is interim. All it does is when that revenues are collected under that, they going into a balancing account that reduces the amount of the cost ship, and that basically offsets about 4x the cost shift that we're seeing today. That's different from the structural rate design issues, which is a more long-term issue. And so that we expect to be addressed in the rate case. And we expect there to be continued discussions around rate design as we lead up to the rate case. And you are also seeing now more debate around the region, California has got a proposed decision out. All those are talking about the long-term. The long-term ways to address the cost shifting issue. But that's very different from the grid access charge. There's an oral argument that will be heard in our case in June -- on June 12, and we'll get more visibility after that oral argument as to how that case will precede. Staff is recommending that nothing happen in -- occur in a rate case. But we pointed out that what's happening is, we're continuing to see that cost shift and it's building up in front of that next rate case.

Our operations are running well and preparing for the summer peak. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station continues to deliver excellent results and is also preparing for the summer with Unit 3 in a planned refueling outage that began Easter weekend. 
Before Jim discusses the first quarter results and our updated financial outlook, there are a few regulatory and strategic developments I will update you on. First, rate design continues to be a priority for APS and it is so increasingly across the country. We have seen progressive steps in other states as well as by our peer utilities here in Arizona. Salt River Project's Board approved a broad-rate design change in February, while Trico, Sulphur Springs, UniSource and TEP all filed for net metering-related changes earlier this year. The steps each utility is taking varies, but appropriately addressing the cost shift and lining the fixed and variable cost discrepancy is a top priority. On April 2, APS asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to increase the grid access charge per future residential solar customer from $0.70 per kilowatt to $3 per kilowatt or approximately $21 per month. We've asked the ACC to have this effective August 1. In its 2013 decision, the ACC found that an interim monthly charge of $3 per kilowatt was reasonable to cover the cost to operate and maintain the electric grid, but decided to begin with a smaller charge of $0.70 per kilowatt and monitor the issue. APS is simply asking the Commission to implement its 2013 decision. Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but is rather intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case or another proceeding.
RUCO agrees that this interim solution should be approved to help mitigate some of the cost shift before the issue can be dealt with more fully in a rate case. New solar customers would have the option of selecting an existing rate that includes the demand charge. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of use rate structures. Since 2013, rooftop solar has seen steady growth. Now over 31,000 customers in our service territories have a rooftop solar system installed. This level of activity reinforces our commitment to modernizing our grid and updating our pricing structures to give customers the platform they need to support the different types of energy and services they want. Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning rooftop solar on about 1,500 homes equal to about 10 megawatts, is now being rolled out. We've completed 2 of the 3 scheduled RFPs to select the Arizona-based companies that will be installing the systems. And we begun soliciting customers on the first group of feeders we've chosen for the program. This innovative program allows us to partner with the Electric Power Research Institute to conduct research on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. In working with various stakeholder groups for this pilot, including the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance, which represents Arizona-based solar installers, we're helping Arizona maintain its solar leadership while ensuring our customers are served well. Our utilities scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 projects under construction in the Phoenix Metro area that will bring that program to 170 megawatts. Those projects are expected to be online this summer. In fact, our AZ Sun Program has largely contributed to another strong showing by APS and Arizona in the Solar Electric Power Association Annual Utilities Solar Rankings that were published this week. APS was ranked in the top 5 in 4 categories, including cumulative megawatts and annual and cumulative interconnections. The Ocotillo modernization project is an important investment to maintain reliability in the valley and support the growth in renewable generation.
We issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity at our Ocotillo peaking facility, equivalent to 3 of the 5 new units. Bids were received in March and have been evaluated. The RFP affirmed that APS's bid at the existing Ocotillo site is the most cost effective. Additionally, our analysis of the project, which was reflected in the bid, determined that it was optimal, from a customer-impact standpoint, to have the project completed in 2019 instead of 2018. And Jim will discuss the financial implications of this change. There are a couple of transmission-related items to update you on also. First, we recently completed construction of the, what we call, HANG2 line, or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2, 500 kV transmission line. The project remains on schedule and is expected to be energized in the second quarter this year after testing and commissioning of both the Hassayampa switchyard and the North Gila substation is complete. In total, the 112-mile long line in the Yuma required construction of 390 steel towers through some extremely difficult terrains. This is a very important project for our company to meet customers' energy needs in southwestern Arizona. 
And second, the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision is expected by the California ISO this summer. During the bidding collaboration period, TransCanyon and Southern California Edison submitted a joint proposal to the Cal-ISO for this project. That replaces the individual bids both parties submitted in November of last year. The collaboration brings together the experience, expertise and proven-track record each organization has in their respective states, TransCanyon in Arizona; and Southern California Edison in California. 
Let me conclude by saying that our focus will continue to be -- to make decisions and investments that position APS in Arizona for sustainable success in a changing energy world. 
I will now -- excuse me, turn the call over to Jim."

For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoin",1313,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included first quarter's financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16.1 million or $0.14 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $15.8 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter of 2014. Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, largely due to Fossil Generation planned outages. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price.
G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. These higher costs were partially offset by the Palo Verde Unit to lease extension we announced in July of last year. As included in our guidance, G&A will be higher all year largely due to Four Corners. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinanced long-term debt at a lower rate.
Turning to Slide 5 and the components of it. Net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. Collectively, the revenue adjustors continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, including the Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1 and contributed $0.06 per share. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effective weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Although weather on both 2015 and 2014 first quarters were less favorable than normal, the first quarter 2015 benefited from an unseasonably warm March compared to the same month in 2014. While residential heating degree-days, a measure of the effects of weather, were 6% higher than last year's first quarter, heating degree-days were 51% below normal 10-year averages. As a result, weather negatively impacted 2015 first quarter by $0.06 per share compared with historically normal conditions.
Lower usage by APS customers compared with the first quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were down 0.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014. The exploration of a long-term wholesale contract at the end of 2014, which is included in guidance, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. There will be a similar variance each quarter this year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms. Also, the impact of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discuss exclude these items, as there was no net impact on first quarter results.
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in Arizona in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 15 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% year-over-year rate in the first quarter, the fastest rate of job growth since Q4 2006.
Notably, this job growth has occurred without relying on the construction sector. Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth and highlight the diversity of Arizona's economy. Additionally, several sources have recently ranked the Greater Phoenix area as one of the top places for small business and entrepreneurs. The environment for small business startups is very strong. As I indicated before, we believe that job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with a much lower cost structure. Of the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, the Phoenix Metro area ranks second in population growth in 2014. This healthy population and job growth is providing continued support for an improved real estate market. As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates for commercial space continue to edge down. And activity in these sectors has picked up with 2.8 million square foot of industrial space and 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction in the first quarter of 2015.
Residential housing demand in Metro Phoenix also continues to increase. As I mentioned on our last call, the increase in demand is primarily being met by multi-family development. Housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies, and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity. The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question, and is largely dependent on the degree of strength in existing single-family home markets. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-over-year. The recovery in prices and rents reflects a continual absorption of vacant homes and apartments in Metro Phoenix. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and continued recovery. We expect each successive year in the near-term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.2% compared with the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support, future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 7, which are unchanged from our last confirmation to guidance.
Looking ahead to 2015 debt issuance. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in the second quarter and raise up to $325 million of additional long-term debt, as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $45 million of commercial paper outstanding. Included in the appendix, today's presentation, are our updated capital expenditures and rate-based slides. Based on our revised projections, the total CapEx for the Ocotillo modernization project is now about $500 million, which reflects a 2019 in-service date and a refined estimate from our previous total of $600 million to $700 million. Our rate-based growth outlook is still 6% to 7%. As we continue to refine our forecast, we currently expect the equity component of the capital structure for APS will be approximately 54% at the end of this year. Therefore, we will not need to issue equity to support the capital structure for this rate cycle. We now forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. 
Operator, we'll now take questions."

And essentially, if we'd have followed that, if that would have been adopted, and we'd have followed that, we would be at the $3 charge. So the challenge right now is that when you don't adjust that charge and you've got no upfront incentives, every time there's a cost reduction on the installed cost of solar, we're not able to capture that.

And they came back. And they're looking at using batteries to install in customers' homes along with solar and to be able to shift the solar production from, maybe, mid-day just a few hours to cover the real peak hours, which the issue we have. Reality is, as the solar production is more towards the mid-day and diminishes significantly by about 4:00, where as our actual peak and peak in the area, so it'll be same for solar project, it's typically in the 4:30 to 7:30 time frame.

Our operations are running well and preparing for the summer peak. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station continues to deliver excellent results and is also preparing for the summer with Unit 3 in a planned refueling outage that began Easter weekend. 
Before Jim discusses the first quarter results and our updated financial outlook, there are a few regulatory and strategic developments I will update you on. First, rate design continues to be a priority for APS and it is so increasingly across the country. We have seen progressive steps in other states as well as by our peer utilities here in Arizona. Salt River Project's Board approved a broad-rate design change in February, while Trico, Sulphur Springs, UniSource and TEP all filed for net metering-related changes earlier this year. The steps each utility is taking varies, but appropriately addressing the cost shift and lining the fixed and variable cost discrepancy is a top priority. On April 2, APS asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to increase the grid access charge per future residential solar customer from $0.70 per kilowatt to $3 per kilowatt or approximately $21 per month. We've asked the ACC to have this effective August 1. In its 2013 decision, the ACC found that an interim monthly charge of $3 per kilowatt was reasonable to cover the cost to operate and maintain the electric grid, but decided to begin with a smaller charge of $0.70 per kilowatt and monitor the issue. APS is simply asking the Commission to implement its 2013 decision. Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but is rather intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case or another proceeding.
RUCO agrees that this interim solution should be approved to help mitigate some of the cost shift before the issue can be dealt with more fully in a rate case. New solar customers would have the option of selecting an existing rate that includes the demand charge. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of use rate structures. Since 2013, rooftop solar has seen steady growth. Now over 31,000 customers in our service territories have a rooftop solar system installed. This level of activity reinforces our commitment to modernizing our grid and updating our pricing structures to give customers the platform they need to support the different types of energy and services they want. Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning rooftop solar on about 1,500 homes equal to about 10 megawatts, is now being rolled out. We've completed 2 of the 3 scheduled RFPs to select the Arizona-based companies that will be installing the systems. And we begun soliciting customers on the first group of feeders we've chosen for the program. This innovative program allows us to partner with the Electric Power Research Institute to conduct research on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. In working with various stakeholder groups for this pilot, including the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance, which represents Arizona-based solar installers, we're helping Arizona maintain its solar leadership while ensuring our customers are served well. Our utilities scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 projects under construction in the Phoenix Metro area that will bring that program to 170 megawatts. Those projects are expected to be online this summer. In fact, our AZ Sun Program has largely contributed to another strong showing by APS and Arizona in the Solar Electric Power Association Annual Utilities Solar Rankings that were published this week. APS was ranked in the top 5 in 4 categories, including cumulative megawatts and annual and cumulative interconnections. The Ocotillo modernization project is an important investment to maintain reliability in the valley and support the growth in renewable generation.
We issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity at our Ocotillo peaking facility, equivalent to 3 of the 5 new units. Bids were received in March and have been evaluated. The RFP affirmed that APS's bid at the existing Ocotillo site is the most cost effective. Additionally, our analysis of the project, which was reflected in the bid, determined that it was optimal, from a customer-impact standpoint, to have the project completed in 2019 instead of 2018. And Jim will discuss the financial implications of this change. There are a couple of transmission-related items to update you on also. First, we recently completed construction of the, what we call, HANG2 line, or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2, 500 kV transmission line. The project remains on schedule and is expected to be energized in the second quarter this year after testing and commissioning of both the Hassayampa switchyard and the North Gila substation is complete. In total, the 112-mile long line in the Yuma required construction of 390 steel towers through some extremely difficult terrains. This is a very important project for our company to meet customers' energy needs in southwestern Arizona. 
And second, the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision is expected by the California ISO this summer. During the bidding collaboration period, TransCanyon and Southern California Edison submitted a joint proposal to the Cal-ISO for this project. That replaces the individual bids both parties submitted in November of last year. The collaboration brings together the experience, expertise and proven-track record each organization has in their respective states, TransCanyon in Arizona; and Southern California Edison in California. 
Let me conclude by saying that our focus will continue to be -- to make decisions and investments that position APS in Arizona for sustainable success in a changing energy world. 
I will now -- excuse me, turn the call over to Jim."

For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoin",1313,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included first quarter's financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16.1 million or $0.14 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $15.8 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter of 2014. Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, largely due to Fossil Generation planned outages. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price.
G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. These higher costs were partially offset by the Palo Verde Unit to lease extension we announced in July of last year. As included in our guidance, G&A will be higher all year largely due to Four Corners. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinanced long-term debt at a lower rate.
Turning to Slide 5 and the components of it. Net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. Collectively, the revenue adjustors continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, including the Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1 and contributed $0.06 per share. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effective weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Although weather on both 2015 and 2014 first quarters were less favorable than normal, the first quarter 2015 benefited from an unseasonably warm March compared to the same month in 2014. While residential heating degree-days, a measure of the effects of weather, were 6% higher than last year's first quarter, heating degree-days were 51% below normal 10-year averages. As a result, weather negatively impacted 2015 first quarter by $0.06 per share compared with historically normal conditions.
Lower usage by APS customers compared with the first quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were down 0.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014. The exploration of a long-term wholesale contract at the end of 2014, which is included in guidance, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. There will be a similar variance each quarter this year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms. Also, the impact of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discuss exclude these items, as there was no net impact on first quarter results.
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in Arizona in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 15 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% year-over-year rate in the first quarter, the fastest rate of job growth since Q4 2006.
Notably, this job growth has occurred without relying on the construction sector. Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth and highlight the diversity of Arizona's economy. Additionally, several sources have recently ranked the Greater Phoenix area as one of the top places for small business and entrepreneurs. The environment for small business startups is very strong. As I indicated before, we believe that job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with a much lower cost structure. Of the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, the Phoenix Metro area ranks second in population growth in 2014. This healthy population and job growth is providing continued support for an improved real estate market. As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates for commercial space continue to edge down. And activity in these sectors has picked up with 2.8 million square foot of industrial space and 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction in the first quarter of 2015.
Residential housing demand in Metro Phoenix also continues to increase. As I mentioned on our last call, the increase in demand is primarily being met by multi-family development. Housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies, and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity. The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question, and is largely dependent on the degree of strength in existing single-family home markets. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-over-year. The recovery in prices and rents reflects a continual absorption of vacant homes and apartments in Metro Phoenix. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and continued recovery. We expect each successive year in the near-term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.2% compared with the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support, future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 7, which are unchanged from our last confirmation to guidance.
Looking ahead to 2015 debt issuance. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in the second quarter and raise up to $325 million of additional long-term debt, as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $45 million of commercial paper outstanding. Included in the appendix, today's presentation, are our updated capital expenditures and rate-based slides. Based on our revised projections, the total CapEx for the Ocotillo modernization project is now about $500 million, which reflects a 2019 in-service date and a refined estimate from our previous total of $600 million to $700 million. Our rate-based growth outlook is still 6% to 7%. As we continue to refine our forecast, we currently expect the equity component of the capital structure for APS will be approximately 54% at the end of this year. Therefore, we will not need to issue equity to support the capital structure for this rate cycle. We now forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. 
Operator, we'll now take questions."

One of the things to consider with that is when we went to the $0.70 charge, that was static.

And essentially, if we'd have followed that, if that would have been adopted, and we'd have followed that, we would be at the $3 charge. So the challenge right now is that when you don't adjust that charge and you've got no upfront incentives, every time there's a cost reduction on the installed cost of solar, we're not able to capture that. And so we're paying too much today for the solar that's going in our territory."

And so we stayed within that frame work and went up to the level of a grid access charge that was supported in that decision, which was the $3 a lot level. All that is interim. All it does is when that revenues are collected under that, they going into a balancing account that reduces the amount of the cost shift, and that basically offsets about 4x the cost shift that we're seeing today. That's different from the structural rate design issues, which is a more long-term issue. And so that we expect to be addressed in the rate case. And we expect there to be continued discussions around rate design as we lead up to the rate case. And you are also seeing now more debate around the region, California has got a proposed decision out. All those are talking about the long-term. The long-term ways to address the cost-shifting issue. But that's very different from the grid access charge.

Our operations are running well and preparing for the summer peak. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station continues to deliver excellent results and is also preparing for the summer with Unit 3 in a planned refueling outage that began Easter weekend. 
Before Jim discusses the first quarter results and our updated financial outlook, there are a few regulatory and strategic developments I will update you on. First, rate design continues to be a priority for APS and it is so increasingly across the country. We have seen progressive steps in other states as well as by our peer utilities here in Arizona. Salt River Project's board approved a broad-rate design change in February, while Trico, Sulphur Springs, UniSource and TEP all filed for net metering-related changes earlier this year. The steps each utility is taking varies, but appropriately addressing the cost shift and lining the fixed and variable cost discrepancy as a top priority. On April 2, APS asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to increase the grid access charge per future residential solar customer from $0.70 per kilowatt to $3 per kilowatt or approximately $21 per month. We've asked the ACC to have this effective August 1. In its 2013 decision, the ACC found that an interim monthly charge of $3 per kilowatt was reasonable to cover the cost to operate and maintain the electric grid, but decided to begin with a smaller charge of $0.70 per kilowatt and monitor the issue. APS is simply asking the Commission to implement its 2013 decision. Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but is rather intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case or another proceeding.
RUCO agrees that this interim solution should be approved to help mitigate some of the cost shift before the issue can be dealt with more fully in a rate case. New solar customers would have the option of selecting an existing rate that includes the demand charge. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of use rate structures. Since 2013, rooftop solar has seen steady growth. Now over 31,000 customers in our service territories have a rooftop solar system installed. This level of activity reinforces our commitment to modernizing our grid and updating our pricing structures to give customers the platform they need to support the different types of energy and services they want. Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning rooftop solar on about 1,500 homes equal to about 10 megawatts, is now being rolled out. We've completed 2 of the 3 scheduled RFPs to select the Arizona-based companies that will be installing the systems. And we began soliciting customers on the first group of feeders we've chosen for the program. This innovative program allows us to partner with the Electric Power Research Institute to conduct research on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. In working with various stakeholder groups for this pilot, including the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance, which represents Arizona-based solar installers, we're helping Arizona maintain its solar leadership while ensuring our customers are served well. Our utilities scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 projects under construction in the Phoenix Metro area that will bring that program to 170 megawatts. Those projects are expected to be online this summer. In fact, our AZ Sun Program has largely contributed to another strong showing by APS and Arizona in the Solar Electric Power Association Annual Utilities Solar Rankings that were published this week. APS was ranked in the top 5 in 4 categories, including cumulative megawatts and annual and cumulative interconnections. The Ocotillo modernization project is an important investment to maintain reliability in the valley and support the growth in renewable generation.
We issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity at our Ocotillo peaking facility, equivalent to 3 of the 5 new units. Bids were received in March and have been evaluated. The RFP affirmed that APS's bid at the existing Ocotillo site is the most cost effective. Additionally, our analysis of the project, which was reflected in the bid, determined that it was optimal, from a customer-impact standpoint, to have the project completed in 2019 instead of 2018. And Jim will discuss the financial implications of this change. There are a couple of transmission-related items to update you on also. First, we recently completed construction of the, what we call, HANG2 line, or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2, 500 kV transmission line. The project remains on schedule and is expected to be energized in the second quarter this year after testing and commissioning of both the Hassayampa switchyard and the North Gila substation is complete. In total, the 112-mile long line into Yuma required construction of 390 steel towers through some extremely difficult terrains. This is a very important project for our company to meet customers' energy needs in southwestern Arizona. 
And second, the Delaney-Colorado transmission line decision is expected by the California ISO this summer. During the bidding collaboration period, TransCanyon and Southern California Edison submitted a joint proposal to the Cal-ISO for this project. That replaces the individual bids both parties submitted in November of last year. The collaboration brings together the experience, expertise and proven-track record each organization has in their respective states, TransCanyon in Arizona; and Southern California Edison in California. 
Let me conclude by saying that our focus will continue to be -- to make decisions and investments that position APS in Arizona for sustainable success in a changing energy world. 
I will now -- excuse me, turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included first quarter's financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoin",1313,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3, and included first quarter's financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. 
For the first quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16.1 million or $0.14 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $15.8 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter of 2014. Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, largely due to Fossil Generation planned outages. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price.
G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. These higher costs were partially offset by the Palo Verde Unit to lease extension we announced in July of last year. As included in our guidance, G&A will be higher all year largely due to Four Corners. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinanced long-term debt at a lower rate.
Turning to Slide 5 and the components of net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. Collectively, the revenue adjustors continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, including the Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1 and contributed $0.06 per share. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Although weather on both 2015 and 2014 first quarters were less favorable than normal, the first quarter 2015 benefited from an unseasonably warm March compared to the same month in 2014. While residential heating degree-days, a measure of the effects of weather, were 6% higher than last year's first quarter, heating degree-days were 51% below normal 10-year averages. As a result, weather negatively impacted 2015 first quarter by $0.06 per share compared with historically normal conditions.
Lower usage by APS customers compared with the first quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were down 0.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014. The expiration of a long-term wholesale contract at the end of 2014, which is included in guidance, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. There will be a similar variance each quarter this year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms. Also, the impact of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, as there was no net impact on first quarter results.
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 15 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% year-over-year rate in the first quarter, the fastest rate of job growth since Q4 2006.
Notably, this job growth has occurred without relying on the construction sector. Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth and highlight the diversity of Arizona's economy. Additionally, several sources have recently ranked the Greater Phoenix area as one of the top places for small business and entrepreneurs. The environment for small business startups is very strong. As I indicated before, we believe that job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix in Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with a much lower cost structure. Of the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, the Phoenix Metro area ranks second in population growth in 2014. This healthy population and job growth is providing continued support for an improved real estate market. As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates for commercial space continue to edge down. And activity in these sectors has picked up with 2.8 million square foot of industrial space and 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction in the first quarter of 2015.
Residential housing demand in Metro Phoenix also continues to increase. As I mentioned on our last call, the increase in demand is primarily being met by multi-family development. Housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies, and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity. The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question, and is largely dependent on the degree of strength in existing single-family home markets. As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-over-year. The recovery in prices and rents reflects a continual absorption of vacant homes and apartments in Metro Phoenix. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and continued recovery. We expect each successive year in the near-term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.2% compared with the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support, future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 7, which are unchanged from our last confirmation to guidance.
Looking ahead to 2015 debt issuance. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in the second quarter and raise up to $325 million of additional long-term debt, as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $45 million of commercial paper outstanding. Included in the appendix, today's presentation, are our updated capital expenditures and rate-based slides. Based on our revised projections, the total CapEx for the Ocotillo modernization project is now about $500 million, which reflects a 2019 in-service date and a refined estimate from our previous total of $600 million to $700 million. Our rate-based growth outlook is still 6% to 7%. As we continue to refine our forecast, we currently expect the equity component of the capital structure for APS will be approximately 54% at the end of this year. Therefore, we will not need to issue equity to support the capital structure for this rate cycle. We now forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. 
Operator, we'll now take questions."

One of the things to consider with that is when we went to the $0.70 charge, that was static.

And essentially, if we'd have followed that, if that would have been adopted, and we'd have followed that, we would be at the $3 charge. So the challenge right now is that when you don't adjust that charge and you've got no upfront incentives, every time there's a cost reduction on the installed cost of solar, we're not able to capture that.

And so we stayed within that frame work and went up to the level of a grid access charge that was supported in that decision, which was the $3 a lot level. All that is interim. All it does is when that revenues are collected under that, they going into a balancing account that reduces the amount of the cost shift, and that basically offsets about 4x the cost shift that we're seeing today. That's different from the structural rate design issues, which is a more long-term issue. And so that we expect to be addressed in the rate case. And we expect there to be continued discussions around rate design as we lead up to the rate case. And you are also seeing now more debate around the region, California has got a proposed decision out. All those are talking about the long-term ways to address the cost-shifting issue. But that's very different from the grid access charge. There's an oral argument that will be heard in our case in June -- on June 12, and we'll get more visibility after that oral argument as to how that case will proceed. Staff is recommending that nothing happen in -- occur in a rate case.

Before Jim discusses the second quarter results and our updated financial outlook, I'll provide a few operational and regulatory developments. Our operations continue to be strong this summer, despite a couple of short-lived powerful storms here in Arizona. 
On the regulatory front, we are focused on a rate modernization and exploring technologies that may improve customer options, while maintaining the reliability of our system. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had a solid first half of the year. In early May, Palo Verde completed the Unit 3 plant refueling outage in less than 30 days. This is the third time Palo Verde has completed  a plant outage in less than 30 days and the first time for Unit 3. We have 2 transmission projects to update you on. First is as we call it Hang 2 or the Hassayampa to North 2 line, a 500 KB transmission line was energized in late May, as we plan. This is a 112 mile line is an important project for reliability in Southwest Arizona. 
Second, CAL ISO announced the winner of the bidding process for Colorado River transmission line earlier this month. Our bid submitted by transcanyon was not selected. The winning bid was decided by the CAL ISO as having the lowest revenue requirement of the 5 bids received. We're analyzing the process to inform our bids on other projects, but we were comfortable with the discipline our team demonstrated on the DCR bid. We did not have CapEx for this project in our projections. We will continue to pursue transmission development opportunities in the Western United States, consistent with our strategy and look forward to future successes with this team and our counterparts at U.S. transmission. Solar also continues to be an important area of investment and research. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun has 2 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix Metropolitan area that are expected online in the third quarter. These 2 projects will bring the program total to 170 megawatts. 
Our APS Solar Partner Program, or APS, will be installing and owning residential rooftop solar on 1,500 homes equal to 10-megawatt is now being rolled out. We had our first insulation earlier this month, completed by one of the local Arizona installers who is also a member of the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance. Our team continues to sign up customers on the selected feeders we've chosen for this program. This innovative program allows us to conduct research in collaboration with EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customer energy needs. On a related note, we are in the early stages of a 200-home rate study intended to provide insights on how solar, storage and another technologies interact with demand rates in that reducing electricity use during peak period. Similar to our 10-megawatt program, we will work with local Arizona installers on this program. APS will own 75 of the systems, while another 125 systems will be customer-owned, with those customers receiving incentive for their participation in the research project. This is an exciting new program that will allow us to realize several benefits. First customers can take charge of their energy envelope by learning how to manage their energy use during peak times. Next local installers can remain viable in our economy and evolve as the market and new technologies evolve. And hear at APS, we can better learn how to manage these advanced technologies and the demands they place on our system, all of which will enable us to continue to safely provide our customers with the reliable electricity they have come to expect. 
Both of these programs are leading edge in our industry and will be the first time utilities have full control of a large number of advanced inverters in the field to perform testing. APS is partnering with several providers to drive this technology in a direction that makes it easier to integrate and results in greater benefits for both customers and grid reliability. On a unrelated note, the recent J.D. Power Residential Service, APS it's improved score in all 6 of the studies categorized and ranked in the top quartile among 54 large investor-owned utilities. 
On the regulatory front, we're focused on advocating for rate modernization and laying the groundwork for our rate case filing, which we still expect to file next year. Rate design continues to be an important priority across the country. Other Arizona utilities have made filings to modernize their rates and California has taken steps to begin modernizing their rate structure. Unyson rate application on May 5, which includes several proposed changes in ray design in line with what we have advocated for and similar solar project implemented this past spring. 
electric and Trico were expected to file a rate application later this year, so both of them recently were through their net metering specific filings. The proceedings at each of these companies will be interesting to monitor. However, our grid access charge filing is based on present we have from 2013 net metering decision. Since then we have been steady -- we have seen steady growth in roof top solar applications and installations with May and June showing record levels. 
Our proposal will not fully resolve the cost shift, but rather is intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case. Other components of the future rate design would include: use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals customers by modifying the time of use rate structure. Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We have a clear investment plan, which gives me confidence in our rate base Given the unique strength of our balance sheet, we're well-positioned to execute on our plan and also return capital to shareholders in a predictable and sustainable manner. I'll now turn the call over to Jim"

Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the secon",1786,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today include: a discussion of our second quarter financial results and update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the second quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $123 million or $1.10 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $132 million or $1.19 per share for the second quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 outlines a very  in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I will highlight a few of the most significant drivers. Lower gross margin decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variants on the next life. 
Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Similar to the first quarter, this variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and cost associated with the acquisition price. 
G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from the financing long-term debt at a lower rate. There is not an operations and maintenance expense variance on this slide, so it is flat year-over-year, as higher generation expenses primarily due to the effects of plant maintenance were offset by lower employee benefit cost. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll cover a few of the key components of net decrease of $0.02 in our gross margin. Weather normalized retail 10-kilowatt sales our sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation, increased 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015 versus 2014, although their earnings impact was immaterial. Collectively, the adjusted mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.10 per share, primary the Four Corners adjusted that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A which I mentioned earlier. 
The effect of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This year's second quarter was milder are less favorable than normal, while the second quarter 2014 was warmer or more favorable when compared to normal condition. 
In total for the quarter, cooling degree days on an 80 degree base were on par with normal conditions, but this one statistic does not do justice to the variance and daily weather we experienced throughout the quarter. 
In particular, the entire month of May and the first half of June were quite mild followed by a snap to hot temperatures in the second half of June. While we saw usage behavior very much in line with expectations once the hot weather arrived in mid-June, prior to that period weather-sensitive usage remained well below our models that are predicted, and indication that our customers took advantage of the mild conditions to essentially not use much air condition at all. 
With 21 days in May below 95 decrease for the high temperature and most overnight low in the low 70s or 60s, the typical heat though that we would expect to see did not materialize, lot of customers ignore the handful of warm days that did occur in the month. The net effect of low transmission revenues decreased quarterly results by $0.04, driven by a formula rate true up in the second quarter of this year included in our annual filing in May. 
We anticipate transmission revenue can be a positive driver for the full year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also the impacts of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers, I discussed exclude these items there was no impact on second quarter results. 
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in the second quarter in Arizona and the Phoenix metro area remained at or above the national average as they have for '14 over the last 16 quarters. As you on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.2% year-over-year rate. For the first 6 months of 2015, Arizona has added jobs at a fastest rate since the first half of 2007. 
As I mentioned before, business services, health care, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth. Each of the sectors is adding jobs at a rate of between 3% and 7% over the prior year and is helping to continued demand for space in Metro Phoenix and elsewhere. 
Absorption of vacant office space in Metro Phoenix has averaged between 2 million and 3 million square feet for 2011 and similarly absorption of vacant retail space as run at about 2 million square feet per year. As seen in the upper right-hand side on of Slide 6, vacancy rates in the sectors continue to work to way down from the highs in 2010 and new investment activity in these sectors has picked up. Almost 4 million square feet of office space is currently under construction, virtually all of which is scheduled to come online in late 2015 or 2016. A multibillion development by Lake accounts for half of this activity. At only 0.5 million square feet, retail consideration can be considered soft at the moment, but with the vacancy rates below 8% and several within the metal area and strengthening single-family home market, we expect retail construction to accelerate in the coming quarters. 
Finally as I have described before, the industrial building sector remains a source of strength for the valley. Over the last couple of years, the amount of new industrial space added to the market has ranged from 4 million to 8 million square foot per year, all of which has been absorbed. At 11%, the industrial vacancy rate is at it's slowest since the beginning of 2008. Only 2 million square feet of industrial space is under construction currently, so we fully expect industrial vacancy to continue to decline and motivate additional construction in the coming quarters. 
Turning to the residential sector. Metro Phoenix has permit are relatively flat for the first 6 months of 2015 on year-over-year basis. However, there were some sizable shifts between the single family and multifamily sectors. Single-family sales and permit activity were up about 35% over the prior year, while new development in the apartment sector slowed considerably. Our expectation for year-end housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. But the dynamics we are seeing in the residential housing market today are influenced by incredibly tight vacancy levels in apartments, rapidly increasing apartment rental rates, continued low interest rates maintaining a higher level of single-family home affordability and the expiration of the mortgage blackout period for the first substantial way foreclosed homeowners. Back in 2008, 37,000 homeowners lost their homes before closure in Metro Phoenix alone. In 2009, 43,000 homes were foreclosed upon. After 7 years, these families will now have much more accessibility to owning a home, while homes remain quite affordable. 
In adjusting to the favorable trends and job growth and the prospects for new construction, Arizona consumers are also participating in the recovery. Real consumer spending on retail and restaurant and bar sales increased by 10% in the second quarter, the best rate in 10 years years. Purchase were led by home and garden sector and new auto sales. Steady income growth, improving consumer confidence and lower gas prices are all contributors to this most recent search. 
In summary, we can see continued healthy job growth, especially in certain sectors providing the momentum for absorption in commercial space and vacant housing, which in turn is providing for an environment of increased investment in new development. As I have mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive to live and do business, especially as its position relative to the high-cost California market. 
We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, EPS retail customer base grew 1.2% compared with the second quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate and respond to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth development and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Slide 7 outlines our financing activities. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry. We are now rated A- or better at all 3 rating agencies. In May, Fitch announced its upgrade to APS as senior unsecured rating to A from A- as well as similar upgrades to Pinnacle West in APS's corporate credit rating. Additionally in June, Moody's upgraded APS as senior unsecured in corporate ratings to A2 and Pinnacle West corporate credit rating to A3. In connection with these rating actions, the rating agencies cited the company's financial and credit profile as well as increasing constructive and supportive regulatory environment in Arizona. In terms of our recent financing on May 19, APS issued $300 million of tenure, 3.15% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to refinance the $300 million, 4.65% maturity. Also in May, APS purchased all 32 million of the American County 2009 series bonds, which means we may later remark it. 
Overall liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the second quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding and APS had $158 million of commercial paper outstanding. Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 8. The mechanisms and cost management remain important drivers. Particularly in the second half of the year, we have maintained our earnings per share guidance, but adjusted certain line items primarily due to what we have realized year-to-date for gross margin and interest saving, while moving plant unit outage spend for 2015 and 2016. Our guidance assumes normal weather. Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018 and we continue to forecast that will not need any additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Before Jim discusses the second quarter results and our updated financial outlook, I'll provide a few operational and regulatory developments. Our operations continue to be strong this summer despite a couple of short-lived but powerful storms here in Arizona. 
On the regulatory front, we are focused on rate modernization and exploring technologies that may improve customer options while maintaining the reliability of our system. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had a solid first half of the year. In early May, Palo Verde completed the Unit 3 plant refueling outage in less than 30 days. This is the third time that Palo Verde has completed  a plant outage in less than 30 days and the first time for Unit 3. 
We have 2 transmission projects to update you on. First, as we call it, HANG2 or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2 line. A 500 kV transmission line was energized in late May, as we planned. This  112-mile line is an important project for reliability in Southwest Arizona. Second, Cal ISO announced the winner of the bidding process for the Delaney to Colorado River transmission line earlier this month. Our bid submitted by TransCanyon was not selected. The winning bid was cited by the Cal ISO as having the lowest revenue requirement of the 5 bids received. We are analyzing the process to inform our bids on other projects, but we were comfortable with the discipline our team demonstrated on the DCR bid. We did not have CapEx for this project in our projections. We will continue to pursue transmission development opportunities in the Western United States, consistent with our strategy, and look forward to future successes with this team and our counterparts at BHE U.S. Transmission. 
Solar also continues to be an important area of investment and research. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix Metropolitan area that are expected online in the third quarter. These 2 projects will bring the program total to 170 megawatts. 
Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning residential rooftop solar on 1,500 homes equal to 10 megawatt, is now being rolled out. We had our first installation earlier this month, completed by one of the local Arizona installers, who is also a member of the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance. Our team continues to sign up customers on the selected feeders we've chosen for this program. This innovative program allows us to conduct research in collaboration with EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers' energy needs. 
On a related note, we are in the early stages of a 200-home rate study intended to provide insights on how solar, storage and another technologies interact with demand rates aimed at reducing electricity use during peak period. Similar to our 10-megawatt program, we will work with local Arizona installers on this program. APS will own 75 of the systems, while another 125 systems will be customer-owned, with those customers receiving an incentive for their participation in the research project. This is an exciting new program that will allow us to realize several benefits. First, customers can take charge of their energy envelope by learning how to manage their energy use during peak times. Next, local installers can remain viable in our economy and evolve as the market and new technologies evolve. And here at APS, we can better learn how to manage these advanced technologies and the demands they place on our system, all of which will enable us to continue to safely provide our customers with the reliable electricity they've come to expect. 
Both of these programs are leading edge in our industry and will be the first time the utilities have full control of a large number of advanced inverters in the field to perform testing. APS is partnering with several providers to drive this technology in a direction that makes it easier to integrate and results in greater benefits for both customers and grid reliability. On a related note, in the recent J.D. Power residential survey, APS improved its score in all 6 of the study's categories and ranked in the top quartile among 54 large investor-owned utilities. 
On the regulatory front, we're focused on advocating for rate modernization and laying the groundwork for a rate case filing, which we still expect to file next year. Rate design continues to be an important priority across the country. Other Arizona utilities have made filings to modernize their rates, and California has taken steps to begin modernizing their rate structure. UniSource Electric filed a rate application on May 5, which includes several proposed changes to rate design, in line with what we have advocated for and similar to what Salt River Project implemented this past spring. Tucson Electric and Trico are expected to file a rate application later this year, so both of them recently withdrew their net metering specific filings. The proceedings at each of these companies will be interesting to monitor. However, our grid access charge filing is based on a precedent we have from the 2013 net metering decision. Since then, we have been steady -- we have seen steady growth in rooftop solar applications and installations, with May and June showing record levels. 
Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but rather is intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time-of-use rate structure. 
Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We have a clear investment plan, which gives me confidence in our rate base growth. Given the unique strength of our balance sheet, we are well positioned to execute on our plan and also return capital to shareholders in a predictable and sustainable manner. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

The topics I will cover today include a discussion of our second quarter financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the seco",1798,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today include a discussion of our second quarter financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. 
Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the second quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $123 million or $1.10 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $132 million or $1.19 per share for the second quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. Lower gross margin decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Similar to the first quarter, this variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price. G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. Lower interest expense net of AFUDC benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing the long-term debt at a lower rate. There is not an operations and maintenance expense variance on this slide, so it is flat year-over-year as higher generation expenses, primarily due to the effects of plant maintenance, were offset by lower employee benefit cost. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll cover a few of the key components of net decrease of $0.02 in our gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation increased 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015 versus 2014, although their earnings impact was immaterial. Collectively, the adjustor mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.10 per share, primarily the Four Corners adjustor that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. 
The effect of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This year's second quarter was milder or less favorable than normal, while the second quarter 2014 was warmer or more favorable compared to normal conditions. 
In total, for the quarter, cooling degree days on an 80-degree base were on par with normal conditions, but this one statistic does not do justice to the variance in daily weather we experienced throughout the quarter. In particular, the entire month of May and the first half of June were quite mild, followed by a snap to hot temperatures in the second half of June. While we saw usage behavior very much in line with expectations once the hot weather arrived in mid-June, prior to that period, weather-sensitive usage remained well below where our models would have predicted, an indication that our customers took advantage of the mild conditions to essentially not use much air-conditioning at all.  With 21 days in May below 95 degrees for the high temperature and most overnight low in the low 70s or 60s, the typical heat buildup we would expect to see did not materialize and allowed customers to ignore the handful of warm days that did occur during the month. The net effect of lower transmission revenues decreased quarterly results by $0.04, driven by a formula rate true-up in the second quarter of this year included in our annual filing in May. We anticipate transmission revenues will be a positive driver for the full year. 
As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustor mechanisms. Also, the impacts of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in the similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, so there was no net impact on second quarter results. 
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in the second quarter in Arizona and the Phoenix metro area remained at or above the national average, as they have for 14 of the last 16 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.2% year-over-year rate. For the first 6 months of 2015, Arizona has added jobs at the fastest rate since the first half of 2007. 
As I have mentioned before, business services, health care, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth. Each of these sectors is adding jobs at a rate of between 3% and 7% over the prior year and is helping to fuel continued demand for office and retail space in Metro Phoenix and elsewhere. Absorption of vacant office space in Metro Phoenix has averaged between 2 million and 3 million square feet per year since 2011, and similarly, absorption of vacant retail space has run at about 2 million square feet per year. As seen on the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates in these sectors continue to work their way down from their highs in 2010, and new investment activity in these sectors has picked up. Almost 4 million square feet of office space is currently under construction, virtually all of which is scheduled to come online in late 2015 or 2016. A multibuilding development by State Farm Insurance at Tempe Town Lake accounts for half of this activity. At only 0.5 million square feet, retail construction can be considered soft at the moment, but with the vacancy rates below 8% in several subregions within the metro area and strengthening single-family home market, we expect retail construction to accelerate in the coming quarters. 
Finally, as I have described before, the industrial building sector remains a source of strength for the valley. Over the last couple of years, the amount of new industrial space added to the market has ranged from 4 million to 8 million square foot per year, all of which has been absorbed. At 11%, the industrial vacancy rate is at its lowest level since the beginning of 2008. Only 2 million square feet of industrial space is under construction currently, so we fully expect industrial vacancy to continue to decline and motivate additional construction in the coming quarters. 
Turning to the residential sector. Metro Phoenix housing permits were relatively flat for the first 6 months of 2015 on a year-over-year basis. However, there were some sizable shifts between the single family and multifamily sectors. Single-family sales and permit activity were up about 35% over the prior year, while new development in the apartment sector slowed considerably. Our expectation for year-end housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. The dynamics we are seeing in the residential housing market today are influenced by incredibly tight vacancy levels in apartments; rapidly increasing apartment rental rates; continued low interest rates, maintaining a higher level of single-family home affordability; and the expiration of the mortgage blackout period for the first substantial wave of foreclosed homeowners. Back in 2008, 37,000 homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure in Metro Phoenix alone. In 2009, 43,000 homes were foreclosed upon. After 7 years, these families will now have much more accessibility to owning a home, while homes remain quite affordable. 
In addition to the favorable trends in job growth and the prospects for new construction, Arizona consumers are also participating in the recovery. Real consumer spending on retail and restaurant and bar sales increased by 10% in the second quarter, the best rate in 10 years. Purchases were led by home and garden sector and new auto sales. Steady income growth, improving consumer confidence and lower gas prices are all contributors to this most recent surge. 
In summary, we can see continued healthy job growth, especially in certain sectors, providing the momentum for absorption of commercial space and vacant housing, which, in turn, is providing for an environment of increased investment and new development. As I have mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is positioned relative to the high-cost California market. 
We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.2% compared with the second quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Slide 7 outlines our financing activities. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry. We are now rated A- or better at all 3 rating agencies. In May, Fitch announced its upgrade to APS's senior unsecured rating to A from A- as well as similar upgrades to Pinnacle West and APS's corporate credit rating. Additionally, in June, Moody's upgraded APS's senior unsecured and corporate ratings to A2 and Pinnacle West Corporate credit rating to A3. In connection with these rating actions, the rating agencies cited the company's strong financial and credit profile as well as increasingly constructive and supportive regulatory environment in Arizona. 
In terms of our recent financings, on May 19, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 3.15% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to refinance the $300 million 4.65% May maturity. Also in May, APS purchased all $32 million of the Maricopa County 2009 series B  pollution control bonds, which we may later remarket. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the second quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $158 million of commercial paper outstanding. 
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 8. The adjustor mechanisms and cost management remain important drivers, particularly in the second half of the year. We have maintained our earnings per share guidance but adjusted certain line items primarily due to what we have realized year-to-date for gross margin and interest savings while moving planned unit outage spend from 2015 into 2016. Our guidance assumes normal weather. Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018, and we continue to forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

We expect to see positive usage in the second half year-over-year. We are -- as I said in my remarks, we have moved the possible outage, so we expect O&M would be down as we have less plant maintenance in the fossil fleet this year, and then we expect the interest savings to continue throughout the year. So that's really what's driving the second half of the year. In terms of weather, I'd just say this. If you remember 2011, we were $30 million under on weather in the second quarter.

Before Jim discusses the second quarter results and our updated financial outlook, I'll provide a few operational and regulatory developments. Our operations continue to be strong this summer despite a couple of short-lived but powerful storms here in Arizona. 
On the regulatory front, we are focused on rate modernization and exploring technologies that may improve customer options while maintaining the reliability of our system. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had a solid first half of the year. In early May, Palo Verde completed the Unit 3 planned refueling outage in less than 30 days. This is the third time that Palo Verde has completed a planned outage in less than 30 days and the first time for Unit 3. 
We have 2 transmission projects to update you on. First, as we call it, HANG2 or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2 line. A 500 kV transmission line was energized in late May, as we planned. This  112-mile line is an important project for reliability in Southwest Arizona. Second, the Cal ISO announced the winner of the bidding process for the Delaney to Colorado River transmission line earlier this month. Our bid submitted by TransCanyon was not selected. The winning bid was cited by the Cal ISO as having the lowest revenue requirement of the 5 bids received. We are analyzing the process to inform our bids on other projects, but we were comfortable with the discipline our team demonstrated on the DCR bid. We did not have CapEx for this project in our projections. We will continue to pursue transmission development opportunities in the Western United States, consistent with our strategy, and look forward to future successes with this team and our counterparts at BHE U.S. Transmission. 
Solar also continues to be an important area of investment and research. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix Metropolitan area that are expected online in the third quarter. These 2 projects will bring the program total to 170 megawatts. 
Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning residential rooftop solar on 1,500 homes equal to 10 megawatt, is now being rolled out. We had our first installation earlier this month, completed by one of the local Arizona installers, who is also a member of the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance. Our team continues to sign up customers on the selected feeders we've chosen for this program. This innovative program allows us to conduct research in collaboration with EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers' energy needs. 
On a related note, we are in the early stages of a 200-home rate study intended to provide insights on how solar, storage and other technologies interact with demand rates aimed at reducing electricity use during peak period. Similar to our 10-megawatt program, we will work with local Arizona installers on this program. APS will own 75 of the systems, while another 125 systems will be customer-owned, with those customers receiving an incentive for their participation in the research project. This is an exciting new program that will allow us to realize several benefits. First, customers can take charge of their energy envelope by learning how to manage their energy use during peak times. Next, local installers can remain viable in our economy and evolve as the market and new technologies evolve. And here at APS, we can better learn how to manage these advanced technologies and the demands they place on our system, all of which will enable us to continue to safely provide our customers with the reliable electricity they've come to expect. 
Both of these programs are leading edge in our industry and will be the first time the utilities have full control of a large number of advanced inverters in the field to perform testing. APS is partnering with several providers to drive this technology in a direction that makes it easier to integrate and results in greater benefits for both customers and grid reliability. On a related note, in the recent J.D. Power residential survey, APS improved its score in all 6 of the study's categories and ranked in the top quartile among 54 large investor-owned utilities. 
On the regulatory front, we're focused on advocating for rate modernization and laying the groundwork for a rate case filing, which we still expect to file next year. Rate design continues to be an important priority across the country. Other Arizona utilities have made filings to modernize their rates, and California has taken steps to begin modernizing their rate structure. UniSource Electric filed a rate application on May 5, which includes several proposed changes to rate design, in line with what we have advocated for and similar to what Salt River Project implemented this past spring. Tucson Electric and Trico are expected to file a rate application later this year, so both of them recently withdrew their net metering specific filings. The proceedings at each of these companies will be interesting to monitor. However, our grid access charge filing is based on a precedent we have from the 2013 net metering decision. Since then, we have been steady -- we have seen steady growth in rooftop solar applications and installations, with May and June showing record levels. 
Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but rather is intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time-of-use rate structure. 
Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We have a clear investment plan, which gives me confidence in our rate base growth. Given the unique strength of our balance sheet, we are well positioned to execute on our plan and also return capital to shareholders in a predictable and sustainable manner. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the seco",1799,"Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today include a discussion of our second quarter financial results, an update on the Arizona economy and a review of our financial outlook. 
Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the second quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $123 million or $1.10 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $132 million or $1.19 per share for the second quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. Lower gross margin decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Similar to the first quarter, this variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price. G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. Lower interest expense net of AFUDC benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing the long-term debt at a lower rate. There is not an operations and maintenance expense variance on this slide, so it is flat year-over-year as higher generation expenses, primarily due to the effects of plant maintenance, were offset by lower employee benefit cost. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll cover a few of the key components of net decrease of $0.02 in our gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation increased 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015 versus 2014, although their earnings impact was immaterial. Collectively, the adjustor mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.10 per share, primarily the Four Corners adjustor that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. 
The effect of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This year's second quarter was milder or less favorable than normal, while the second quarter 2014 was warmer or more favorable compared to normal conditions. 
In total, for the quarter, cooling degree days on an 80-degree base were on par with normal conditions, but this one statistic does not do justice to the variance in daily weather we experienced throughout the quarter. In particular, the entire month of May and the first half of June were quite mild, followed by a snap to hot temperatures in the second half of June. While we saw usage behavior very much in line with expectations once the hot weather arrived in mid-June, prior to that period, weather-sensitive usage remained well below where our models would have predicted, an indication that our customers took advantage of the mild conditions to essentially not use much air-conditioning at all. With 21 days in May below 95 degrees for the high temperature and most overnight low in the low 70s or 60s, the typical heat buildup we would expect to see did not materialize and allowed customers to ignore the handful of warm days that did occur during the month. The net effect of lower transmission revenues decreased quarterly results by $0.04, driven by a formula rate true-up in the second quarter of this year included in our annual filing in May. We anticipate transmission revenues will be a positive driver for the full year. 
As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the impacts of our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in the similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, so there was no net impact on second quarter results. 
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in the second quarter in Arizona and the Phoenix metro area remained at or above the national average, as they have for 14 of the last 16 quarters. As seen on the lower right-hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.2% year-over-year rate. For the first 6 months of 2015, Arizona has added jobs at the fastest rate since the first half of 2007. 
As I have mentioned before, business services, health care, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth. Each of these sectors is adding jobs at a rate of between 3% and 7% over the prior year and is helping to fuel continued demand for office and retail space in Metro Phoenix and elsewhere. Absorption of vacant office space in Metro Phoenix has averaged between 2 million and 3 million square feet per year since 2011, and similarly, absorption of vacant retail space has run at about 2 million square feet per year. As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates in these sectors continue to work their way down from their highs in 2010, and new investment activity in these sectors has picked up. Almost 4 million square feet of office space is currently under construction, virtually all of which is scheduled to come online in late 2015 or 2016. A multibuilding development by State Farm Insurance at Tempe Town Lake accounts for half of this activity. At only 0.5 million square feet, retail construction can be considered soft at the moment, but with the vacancy rates below 8% in several subregions within the metro area and strengthening single-family home market, we expect retail construction to accelerate in the coming quarters. 
Finally, as I have described before, the industrial building sector remains a source of strength for the valley. Over the last couple of years, the amount of new industrial space added to the market has ranged from 4 million to 8 million square foot per year, all of which has been absorbed. At 11%, the industrial vacancy rate is at its lowest level since the beginning of 2008. Only 2 million square feet of industrial space is under construction currently, so we fully expect industrial vacancy to continue to decline and motivate additional construction in the coming quarters. 
Turning to the residential sector. Metro Phoenix housing permits were relatively flat for the first 6 months of 2015 on a year-over-year basis. However, there were some sizable shifts between the single family and multifamily sectors. Single-family sales and permit activity were up about 35% over the prior year, while new development in the apartment sector slowed considerably. Our expectation for year-end housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. The dynamics we are seeing in the residential housing market today are influenced by incredibly tight vacancy levels in apartments; rapidly increasing apartment rental rates; continued low interest rates, maintaining a higher level of single-family home affordability; and the expiration of the mortgage blackout period for the first substantial wave of foreclosed homeowners. Back in 2008, 37,000 homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure in Metro Phoenix alone. In 2009, 43,000 homes were foreclosed upon. After 7 years, these families will now have much more accessibility to owning a home, while homes remain quite affordable. 
In addition to the favorable trends in job growth and the prospects for new construction, Arizona consumers are also participating in the recovery. Real consumer spending on retail and restaurant and bar sales increased by 10% in the second quarter, the best rate in 10 years. Purchases were led by home and garden sector and new auto sales. Steady income growth, improving consumer confidence and lower gas prices are all contributors to this most recent surge. 
In summary, we can see continued healthy job growth, especially in certain sectors, providing the momentum for absorption of commercial space and vacant housing, which, in turn, is providing for an environment of increased investment and new development. As I have mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is positioned relative to the high-cost California market. 
We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.2% compared with the second quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Slide 7 outlines our financing activities. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry. We are now rated A- or better at all 3 rating agencies. In May, Fitch announced its upgrade to APS's senior unsecured rating to A from A- as well as similar upgrades to Pinnacle West and APS's corporate credit rating. Additionally, in June, Moody's upgraded APS's senior unsecured and corporate ratings to A2 and Pinnacle West Corporate credit rating to A3. In connection with these rating actions, the rating agencies cited the company's strong financial and credit profile as well as increasingly constructive and supportive regulatory environment in Arizona. 
In terms of our recent financings, on May 19, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 3.15% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to refinance the $300 million 4.65% May maturity. Also in May, APS purchased all $32 million of the Maricopa County 2009 series B pollution control bonds, which means we may later remarket. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the second quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $158 million of commercial paper outstanding. 
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 8. The adjustor mechanisms and cost management remain important drivers, particularly in the second half of the year. We have maintained our earnings per share guidance but adjusted certain line items primarily due to what we have realized year-to-date for gross margin and interest savings while moving planned unit outage spend from 2015 into 2016. Our guidance assumes normal weather. Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018, and we continue to forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Pinnacle West delivered a solid quarter with several financial and operational highlights keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year and setting us up well for next year. The Board also approved a 5% dividend increase last week effective with the December dividend payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. Jim will discuss the financial results and guidance. 
Our operations team did an excellent job of maintaining the fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde nuclear generation station performed well. Unit 2 entered its planned refueling outage on October 10. This outage marks an important milestone. It represents the completion of flex equipment installation at all 3 units. Flex addresses one of the main safety challenges at Fukushima, the loss of cooling capability and electrical power resulting from a severe event. Flex, short for diverse and flexible mitigation strategies, is an industry-wide initiative with site-specific applicability. It relies on portable equipment to protect against even the most unlikely scenarios. 
The transmission distribution and customer service teams also performed well. Similar to last year, we had a series of monsoon storms over the last few months. 50,000 customers were without power during the worst storm. The vast majority were back on within 24 hours. Due to the storm damage, our crews replaced 485 poles, nearly twice the number from the 2014 storm season. 
August was particularly hot this year. We hit our 2015 load peak on Saturday, August 15, after temperatures hit over 114 degrees for 3 consecutive days. This is the first time in modern era with air-conditioning that our peak has been on a Saturday. One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5:00 p.m. that day, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 38% of its capacity, supplying 75 megawatts of the 7,031-megawatt load since rooftop solar peaks around noon. However, in stark contrast, utility scale solar was producing 80% of its capacity, supplying 140 megawatts of the load because most utilities scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. Just a couple of hours later, when our system load was still high, rooftop solar production was at 0 and the only solar production was coming from Solana, our concentrated solar facility with thermal storage capabilities. This scenario is not unique to our peak load date and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day, along with a robust and modern grid, modernizing their rate structure is a necessary priority for which we have been advocating. 
Let me provide some perspective on how our recent regulatory filings have evolved. Our priority remains clear. We want to continue the dialogue on rate designs with the objective of thoughtfully evaluating these policy issues ahead of the rate case application we plan to file in June of next year. The grid access charge filing we made on April 2 was designed to take another step in this rate transition by increasing the fixed charge to $3 per KW or about $21 per month for solar customers. In August, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted 3-2 to move forward with an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The exact scope and timing of that process was to be determined at another meeting. 
Subsequent to that position, we saw an unprecedented display of political theater and character attacks by the rooftop solar lobby aimed at perilizing the Commission. Given that backdrop, we offer an alternative to the Commission in September to forgo the request to increase the grid access charge in exchange for a more narrow hearing on the cost to serve customers with and without solar. In connection with this alternative, we filed a summary of a recently concluded cost-of-service study on October 8. This study used a methodology that has been tried, tested and validated in utility proceedings across the country using actual verifiable data, and concluded that each month, APS incurs $67 to serve solar customers that those customers do not pay. This analysis credits solar customers for the measurable cost that APS avoids when a customer installs rooftop solar primarily reduce fuel costs. 
The Commission discussed how to proceed at the open meeting last week. In the end, they voted to move forward with a single generic docket that will investigate both the cost of service issues raised by APS and the value of solar. The procedural calendar will determine -- will be determined soo by the Commission staff. Although there has been a lot of noise around this issue, we believe moving forward is critical, and we will continue to work with the Commission in key stakeholders in this proceeding. 
In addition to the regulatory proceedings, we are also learning about the customer and grid impacts through our solar partner rooftop solar program. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers' energy needs. We've had a lot of interest and are in the process of signing up customers and installing rooftop systems. 
Let me now provide an update on a few other items related to our generation portfolio. Our utilities scale program, AZ Sun, has two 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix Metro area come online in December, bringing the total -- program total to 170 megawatts. We will assess the need for more utility scale solar through our resource planning process. We also retired Unit 2, one of our coal units, as of October 1, in line with our announcement a year ago as part of a broader environmental plant for the Choya site. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next couple of years, while the state addresses rate design modernization and we prepare for our rate case filing. We'll remain steadfast to find solutions that benefit all of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

We had a solid third quarter as we benefited from our continued cost management efforts and an improvement in our customer sales. Today, I'll discuss the details of our third quarter financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2016 guidance. 
Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP income and ongoing earnings. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $257 million or $2.30 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $244 million or $2.20 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight 2 primary drivers. Higher gross margin increased earnings by $0.28 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Going the other way, higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.12 per share. Similar to the first half of this year, the variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition. D&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant service. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll cover a few of the key components of the net increase of $0.28 in gross margin. Higher usage by APS customers compared to the third quarter a year ago contributed $0.08 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation, increased 2.1% in the third quarter of 2015 versus 2014. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.17 per share, primarily the Four Corners adjustor that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effects of weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. This year's third quarter was warmer or made more favorable than normal, while our third quarter 2014 was milder or less favorable compared to normal conditions. As Don mentioned, our August was hot this year, but for the first time since the advent of air-conditioning, we hit the peak on our weekend. 
As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. 
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in the third quarter in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 17 quarters. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 6, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial activity, system services and consumer service sector, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. 
Growth in consumer spending remains robust and expectations are improving for the housing market. Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 6. The housing market is on track to record its best year since 2007 for both bottle permits and the single family sector by itself. Total permits are up more than 12% this year, and notably, single-family permit activity is up over 40%. Permit activity in the third quarter was the highest we've seen since the middle of 2007 and homebuilders continue to report strong traffic and their sales offices. 
In summary, Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years as it tracks on the overbuilt real estate markets received into the past. As I've mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 
[indiscernible] '15 is turning out to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction, and we expect 2016 to be better than 2015, reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the lower half of the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share based on the negative effects of weather through September. Year-to-date unfavorable weather through September has impacted earnings by approximately $0.08 per share versus normal conditions. We adjusted our 2015 customer growth down slightly to 1% to 2% from 1.5% to 2.5%, although our sales outlook hasn't changed. We are introducing 2016 ongoing guidance of $3.90 [ph] to $4.10 per share, which assumes the normal weather. The adjust of mechanisms, particularly transmission and the LFCR, along with modest sales growth of the key gross margin drivers. 
O&M is about trend in 2016, however, non-outage O&M spending remains flat in 2016 compared to 2015 with planned possible outages representing the increase year-over-year. This includes major planned outages at Four Corners and Cholla, which occur roughly every 6 years. 
Separately, the new lease terms related to the Palo Verde sale-leaseback at Unit 2 will take effect on January 1, 2016, offset planted service impact in key depreciation and amortization relatively flat year-over-year. A complete list of the factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in our slides. 
Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018. We have included our updated rate base slide in the appendix. These estimates include bonus depreciation, which we are assuming will be extended for 2015 and 2016. And we continue to forecast that we will not give additional equity until 2017 at the earliest.

Unit 2 entered its planned refueling outage on October 10. This outage marks an important milestone. It represents the completion of flex equipment installation at all 3 units. Flex addresses one of the main safety challenges at Fukushima, the loss of cooling capability and electrical power resulting from a severe event. Flex, short for diverse and flexible mitigation strategies, is an industry-wide initiative with site-specific applicability. It relies on portable equipment to protect against even the most unlikely scenarios. 
The transmission, distribution and customer service teams also performed well. Similar to last year, we had a series of monsoon storms over the last few months. 50,000 customers were without power during the worst storm. The vast majority were back on within 24 hours. Due to the storm damage, our crews replaced 485 poles, nearly twice the number from the 2014 storm season. 
August was particularly hot this year. We hit our 2015 load peak on Saturday, August 15, after temperatures hit over 114 degrees for 3 consecutive days. This is the first time in modern era with air-conditioning that our peak has been on a Saturday. One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5:00 p.m. that day, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 38% of its capacity, supplying 75 megawatts of the 7,031-megawatt load since rooftop solar peaks around noon. However, in stark contrast, utility scale solar was producing 80% of its capacity, supplying 140 megawatts of the load because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. Just a couple of hours later, when our system load was still high, rooftop solar production was at 0, and the only solar production was coming from Solana, our concentrated solar facility with thermal storage capabilities. This scenario is not unique to our peak load date and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. Along with a robust and modern grid, modernizing the rate structure is a necessary priority for which we have been advocating. 
Let me provide some perspective on how our recent regulatory filings have evolved. Our priority remains clear. We want to continue the dialogue on rate design with the objective of thoughtfully evaluating these policy issues ahead of the rate case application we plan to file in June of next year. The grid access charge filing we made on April 2 was designed to take another step in this rate transition by increasing the fixed charge to $3 per kW or about $21 per month for solar customer. In August, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted 3-2 to move forward with an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The exact scope and timing of that process was to be determined at another meeting. 
Subsequent to that decision, we saw an unprecedented display of political theater and character attacks by the rooftop solar lobby aimed at paralyzing the Commission. Given that backdrop, we offered an alternative to the Commission in September to forgo the request to increase the grid access charge in exchange for a more narrow hearing on the cost to serve customers with and without solar. In connection with this alternative, we filed a summary of a recently concluded cost of service study on October 8. This study used a methodology that has been tried, tested and validated in utility proceedings across the country using actual verifiable data and concluded that each month, APS incurs $67 to serve solar customers that those customers do not pay. This analysis credits solar customers for the measurable cost that APS avoids when a customer installs rooftop solar, primarily reduced fuel cost. 
The Commission discussed how to proceed at the open meeting last week. In the end, they voted to move forward with a single generic docket that will investigate both the cost of service issue raised by APS and the value of solar. The procedural calendar will determine -- be determined soon by the Commission staff. Although there has been a lot of noise around this issue, we believe moving forward is critical, and we will continue to work with the Commission and key stakeholders in this proceeding. 
In addition to the regulatory proceedings, we are also learning about the customer and grid impacts through our Solar Partner rooftop solar program. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers' energy needs. We've had a lot of interest and are in the process of signing up customers and installing rooftop systems. 
Let me now provide an update on a few other items related to our generation portfolio. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun, has 2 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix Metro area come online in September, bringing the total program -- total to 170 megawatts. We will assess the need for more utility scale solar through our resource planning process. We also retired Cholla Unit 2, one of our coal units, as of October 1, in line with our announcement a year ago as part of a broader environmental plant for the Cholla site. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next couple of years, while the state addresses rate design modernization and we prepare for our rate case filings. We'll remain steadfast to find solutions that benefit all of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,312658434,887446,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2015",2015-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and welcome, everybody. We had a solid third quarter as we benefited from our continued cost management efforts and an improvement in our customer sales. Today, I'll discuss the details of our third quarter financial results, provide an up",1060,"Thank you, Don, and welcome, everybody. We had a solid third quarter as we benefited from our continued cost management efforts and an improvement in our customer sales. Today, I'll discuss the details of our third quarter financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2016 guidance. 
Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $257 million or $2.30 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $244 million or $2.20 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight 2 primary drivers. Higher gross margin increased earnings by $0.28 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Going the other way, higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.12 per share. Similar to the first half of this year, the variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition. D&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll cover a few of the key components of the net increase of $0.28 in gross margin. Higher usage by APS customers compared to the third quarter a year ago contributed $0.08 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation increased 2.1% in the third quarter of 2015 versus 2014. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.17 per share, primarily the Four Corners adjustor that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effects of weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. This year's third quarter was warmer or made more favorable than normal, while our third quarter 2014 was milder or less favorable compared to normal conditions. As Don mentioned, August was particularly hot this year, where, for the first time since the advent of air-conditioning, we hit our peak on a weekend. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. 
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has the past several quarters. Job growth in the third quarter in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 17 quarters. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 6, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial activity, system services and consumer service sector, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. 
Growth in consumer spending remains robust, and expectations are improving for the housing market. Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 6. The housing market is on track to record its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself. Total permits are up more than 12% this year, and notably, single-family permit activity is up over 40%. Permit activity in the third quarter was the highest we've seen since the middle of 2007, and homebuilders continue to report strong traffic in their sales offices. 
In summary, Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years as a drag from the overbuilt real estate markets recedes into the past. As I've mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 
2015 is turning out to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction, and we expect 2016 to be better than 2015. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the lower half of the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share based on the negative effects of weather through September. Year-to-date unfavorable weather through September has impacted earnings by approximately $0.08 per share versus normal conditions. We adjusted our 2015 customer growth down slightly to 1% to 2% from 1.5% to 2.5%, although our sales outlook hasn't changed. We are introducing 2016 ongoing guidance of $3.90 to $4.10 per share, which assumes normal weather. The adjustment mechanisms, particularly Transmission and the LFCR, along with modest sales growth, are the key gross margin drivers. O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spending remains flat in 2016 compared to 2015, with planned fossil outages representing the increase year-over-year. This includes major planned outages at Four Corners and Cholla, which occur roughly every 6 years. 
Separately, the new lease terms related to the Palo Verde sale leaseback at Unit 2 that take effect on January 1, 2016, offset plant in service impact and key depreciation and amortization relatively flat year-over-year. A complete list of the factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in our slides. 
Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018. We have included our updated rate base slide in the appendix. These estimates include bonus depreciation, which we are assuming will be extended for 2015 and 2016. And we continue to forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
Lastly, as Don discussed, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend last week by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.50 per share effective with the December payment. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

How it makes fair value findings in the context of adjustor mechanisms and things like that. So we get them in rate cases. We do typically fair value findings and provisions in almost everything that we do. And so what I think folks are looking for right now is clarify some of the things that were in the Court of Appeals decision.

Pinnacle West delivered a solid quarter with several financial and operational highlights, keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year and setting us up well for next year. The board also approved a 5% dividend increase last week effective with the December dividend payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. Jim will discuss the financial results and guidance. 
Our operations team did an excellent job maintaining the fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station performed well. Unit 2 entered its planned refueling outage on October 10. This outage marks an important milestone. It represents the completion of flex equipment installation at all three units. Flex addresses one of the main safety challenges at Fukushima, the loss of cooling capability and electrical power resulting from a severe event. Flex, short for diverse and flexible mitigation strategies, is an industry-wide initiative with site-specific applicability. It relies on portable equipment to protect against even the most unlikely scenarios. 
The transmission, distribution and customer service teams also performed well. Similar to last year, we had a series of monsoon storms over the last few months. 50,000 customers were without power during the worst storm. The vast majority were back on within 24 hours. Due to the storm damage, our crews replaced 485 poles, nearly twice the number from the 2014 storm season. 
August was particularly hot this year. We hit our 2015 load peak on Saturday, August 15, after temperatures hit over 114 degrees for three consecutive days. This is the first time in modern era with air-conditioning that our peak has been on a Saturday. One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5:00 p.m. that day, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 38% of its capacity, supplying 75 megawatts of the 7,031-megawatt load since rooftop solar peaks around noon. However, in stark contrast, utility scale solar was producing 80% of its capacity, supplying 140 megawatts of the load because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. Just a couple of hours later, when our system load was still high, rooftop solar production was at 0, and the only solar production was coming from Solana, our concentrated solar facility with thermal storage capabilities. This scenario is not unique to our peak load day and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. Along with a robust and modern grid, modernizing the rate structure is a necessary priority for which we have been advocating. 
Let me provide some perspective on how our recent regulatory filings have evolved. Our priority remains clear. We want to continue the dialogue on rate design with the objective of thoughtfully evaluating these policy issues ahead of the rate case application we plan to file in June of next year. The grid access charge filing we made on April 2 was designed to take another step in this rate transition by increasing the fixed charge to $3 per kW or about $21 per month per solar customer. In August, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted 3-2 to move forward with an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The exact scope and timing of that process was to be determined at another meeting. 
Subsequent to that decision, we saw an unprecedented display of political theater and character attacks by the rooftop solar lobby aimed at paralyzing the Commission. Given that backdrop, we offered an alternative to the Commission in September to forgo the request to increase the grid access charge in exchange for a more narrow hearing on the cost to serve customers with and without solar. In connection with this alternative, we filed a summary of a recently concluded cost of service study on October 8. This study used a methodology that has been tried, tested and validated in utility proceedings across the country using actual verifiable data. It concluded that each month, APS incurs $67 to serve solar customers that those customers do not pay. This analysis credits solar customers for the measurable cost that APS avoids when a customer installs rooftop solar, primarily reduced fuel cost. 
The Commission discussed how to proceed at the open meeting last week. In the end, they voted to move forward with a single generic docket that will investigate both the cost of service issue raised by APS and the value of solar. The procedural calendar will determine -- be determined soon by the Commission staff. Although there has been a lot of noise around this issue, we believe moving forward is critical, and we will continue to work with the Commission and key stakeholders in this proceeding. 
In addition to the regulatory proceedings, we are also learning about the customer and grid impacts through our Solar Partner rooftop solar program. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers' energy needs. We've had a lot of interest and are in the process of signing up customers and installing rooftop systems. 
Let me now provide an update on a few other items related to our generation portfolio. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun, has two 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix Metro area come online in September, bringing the total program -- total to 170 megawatts. We will assess the need for more utility scale solar through our resource planning process. We also retired Cholla Unit 2, one of our coal units, as of October 1, in line with our announcement a year ago as part of a broader environmental plant for the Cholla site. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next couple of years, while the state addresses rate design modernization and we prepare for our rate case filings. We'll remain steadfast to find solutions that benefit all of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

We had a solid third quarter as we benefited from our continued cost management efforts and an improvement in our customer sales. Today, I'll discuss the details of our third quarter financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2016 guidance. 
Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $257 million or $2.30 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $244 million or $2.20 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight two primary drivers. Higher gross margin increased earnings by $0.28 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Going the other way, higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.12 per share. Similar to the first half of this year, the variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition. D&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll cover a few of the key components of the net increase of $0.28 in gross margin. Higher usage by APS customers compared to the third quarter a year ago contributed $0.08 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation increased 2.1% in the third quarter of 2015 versus 2014. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.17 per share, primarily the Four Corners adjustor that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier. The effects of weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. This year's third quarter was warmer or made more favorable than normal, while our third quarter 2014 was milder or less favorable compared to normal conditions. As Don mentioned, August was particularly hot this year, where, for the first time since the advent of air-conditioning, we hit our peak on a weekend. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. 
Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow much like it has the past several quarters. Job growth in the third quarter in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average as they have for the past 17 quarters. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 6, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial activity, system services and consumer service sector, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. 
Growth in consumer spending remains robust, and expectations are improving for the housing market. Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 6. The housing market is on track to record its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself. Total permits are up more than 12% this year, and notably, single-family permit activity is up over 40%. Permit activity in the third quarter was the highest we've seen since the middle of 2007, and homebuilders continue to report strong traffic in their sales offices. 
In summary, Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years as a drag from the overbuilt real estate markets recedes into the past. As I've mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 
2015 is turning out to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction, and we expect 2016 to be better than 2015. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the lower half of the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share based on the negative effects of weather through September. Year-to-date unfavorable weather through September has impacted earnings by approximately $0.08 per share versus normal conditions. We adjusted our 2015 customer growth down slightly to 1% to 2% from 1.5% to 2.5%, although our sales outlook hasn't changed. We are introducing 2016 ongoing guidance of $3.90 to $4.10 per share, which assumes normal weather. The adjustment mechanisms, particularly Transmission and the LFCR, along with modest sales growth, are the key gross margin drivers. O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spending remains flat in 2016 compared to 2015, with planned fossil outages representing the increase year-over-year. This includes major planned outages at Four Corners and Cholla, which occur roughly every 6 years. 
Separately, the new lease terms related to the Palo Verde sale leaseback at Unit 2 that take effect on January 1, 2016, offset plan and service impact and keep depreciation and amortization relatively flat year-over-year. A complete list of the factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in our slides. 
Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018. We have included our updated rate base slide in the appendix. These estimates include bonus depreciation, which we are assuming will be extended for 2015 and 2016. And we continue to forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest. 
Lastly, as Don discussed, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend last week by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.50 per share effective with the December payment. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

How it makes fair value findings in the context of adjustor mechanisms and things like that. So we get them in rate cases. We do typically fair value findings and provisions in almost everything that we do.
