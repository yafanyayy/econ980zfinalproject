Sorry for the change of schedule but we have a feeling that will all the news we have to share with you today, it was better to organize it as early as possible in the morning. So I'm here wi",2134,"Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for joining this call. Sorry for the change of schedule but we have a feeling that will all the news we have to share with you today, it was better to organize it as early as possible in the morning. 
So I'm here with Karim Hajjar, our CFO; and Roger Kearns, who is a member of the Executive Committee who is currently supervising the Advanced Materials cluster and who is playing a key role in the Cytec integration project.
So what I suggest is to spend a few minutes to go over the Q2 results, which by the way, are pretty, in my view, at least simple and straightforward and then move into a full presentation of the Cytec project, which by the way, it's for me, a major milestone in the transformation of Solvay. And then we'll open to Q&A.
So quick overview of our results. Very similar -- Q2 very similar to Q1. We were able to post a solid 8% REBITDA increase versus last year, which means EUR 500 million of REBITDA. Sales up 4%. Margin, 19%, 66 basis points of improvement so overall solid. 
When we look at the components, clearly, we've benefited very much from ForEx, EUR 55 million of impact in this quarter, EUR 100 million of positive impact from ForEx for the full half year. Volumes were down slightly but down. In fact, if -- when we look across the board, we see 3 different situations, 2 specific issues, businesses where we have significant volume shortfalls, no surprises, Novecare oil and gas segment still at a very low level. Information there is not always simple to put together. We continue to see a strong production of tight oil and shale gas in the U.S. but little exploration activities. We see transformation in the supply chain. We think that we are strengthening our position but in a market where volumes are minimal.
Acetow, still feeling the impact of the destocking that started last year in China, although a slight improvement at the end of the quarter, which gives us a bit of hope that this situation will improve during the second half of the year. 
We have businesses which are doing very well, mostly the Advanced Materials cluster, where we have strong volume dynamic, which is based on innovation and then very strong pricing for oil across the board, EUR 57 million of impact in Q2, EUR 90 million for the first half, which means that even in markets where we are suffering from low volumes, we are able to defend prices and margins. And this, by the way, has been a feature for Solvay for many years. We put clearly price before volume, and I think that strategy is paying off. 
If you look at our segments, 3 of our 4 segments are showing very solid REBITDA improvement. Advanced Formulations is the only one which is down 12%, mostly linked to the oil and gas situation in Novecare that I was mentioning, unfortunately not helped by Coatis. The Brazilian situation is -- Brazil is the only region of the world where we see a very challenging macro environment. Aroma being a bit more positive. 
Advanced Materials is really the star segment if I may say so, 18% REBITDA improvement, another record. 9% volume dynamic and this is fully based on innovation, smart devices, lightweighting of various sorts. Ryton integration is also going well. 
Performance Chemicals up 9%, which is a very good performance despite the acetyl situation I was referring to. Solid pricing in soda ash and peroxide allowed us to achieve this result. And excellence initiatives are continuing to be the strong performance driver in this cluster. 
And then Functional Polymers up 23%. Market fundamentals are improving for our Polyamide business, both on the raw material and energy cost side but also on the market. And on top of this, the excellence initiatives that we have aggressively developed within this cluster are also paying off. 
Significant cash flow generation, EUR 167 million for the quarter so it shows that we are still very much focused on cash. So overall, solid results for Q2, which allow us to confirm our previous guidance, which called for strong growth of our REBITDA in 2015 versus 2014.
We've made also some progress in the portfolio during this second quarter. Obviously, we are all expecting the finalization of our PVC Europe deal. INOVYN was indeed created July 1. It really has been a very long, very painful project but we've stayed very committed to it, and we are very pleased to see that the divestiture of this PVC -- European PVC business is now becoming a reality. You know that we have already an exit, which is very well defined 3 years down the road and for us, this was really the best possible way to exit from this European PVC business while maximizing the positive impact for various stakeholders. 
But again, talking about portfolio, the key issue today is the presentation of the Cytec project, which in our view is an incredibly powerful opportunity to continue our portfolio transformation. I will now -- I suggest that you follow this presentation on the -- using the documents that we've made available. So you've seen the conference details link, which will allow you to follow the -- this presentation and I would try to refer to the slide I'm using to make it as clear as possible.
So we -- after some careful consideration, we considered that Cytec was indeed a perfect fit with Solvay's strategy. And we will try to explain you why. I will give you another view of the strategic rationale representation. Roger will develop the business case and the very significant opportunities we see on the 2 markets where Cytec will help us become a very significant player. And obviously, Karim will come on the transaction details and the financial impact.
So starting on Slide 5. I mean, since I took over as the CEO of Solvay, I told you that we would be transforming our portfolio quite aggressively. So 2011, the Rhodia acquisition; 2013, Chemlogics; '14, Ryton. We started also some divestiture, Eco Services in '14; INOVYN JV I just referred to it in '15. We are still working to finalize the exit of our Latin American PVC business. 
And today, we're seeing that Cytec is again a major milestone. Very much aligned, by the way, with I was telling you in the conclusion of our Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago. I was mentioning that our objective in 2015 was to accelerate the transformation, and I'm very pleased to see that a few weeks after, we are indeed coming to share with you this very important project. 
You've seen on Slide 5 the small matrix that we are using to present our portfolio, with value creation potential and ability to the extract values of our various businesses. Clearly for us, Cytec is on the upper right-hand corner and this is the direction in which we are driving Solvay's portfolio. 
And by the way, Cytec is not the final transaction regarding our portfolio. We think that we need to continue portfolio adjustment, portfolio changes, and Cytec is probably a great opportunity for us to continue to look at what can be done to improve the quality of our portfolio. 
The strategic fit for us is excellent. Just by this acquisition, Solvay will become the world #2 largest player in aerospace composite materials. This acquisition strengthens very much our Advanced Materials approach. You've heard us saying that lightweighting is a key driver for the group of Advanced Materials. We lacked a position in composites. Thanks to Cytec, we are becoming immediately a leader in composites. 
On the Advanced Formulations segment, same impact. Cytec is a global leader in mining chemical business, and we'll explain you later on why we think this mining chemical business is a great business. And thanks to Cytec and the integration of Cytec activities with Novecare, we will strengthen very significantly our position in mining and oil and gas.
Cytec is a company which is very much innovation-driven, very close to customers. Lightweighting but also mining chemicals allow customer to meet more effectively the sustainability challenges and this is for us a very important driver in our strategy too. 
From a financial standpoint, we will be able to strengthen our earnings momentum. We are very determined to extract pretax synergies of more than EUR 100 million per year. And this acquisition will be adjusted EPS accretive after year 1. And when we look at the objectives we had in the transformation of Solvay that we have stated several times, I think we tick all the boxes. Cytec will bring us growth, Cytec will bring us resilience and Cytec will bring us improved returns.
Moving on Slide 7, just to give you a bit more flavor of who Cytec is. Cytec is a $2 billion company, 20% REBITDA margin, 4,600 employees, 29 sites, with a strong focus on composites, which represent 2/3 of Cytec's activities, 1/3 being the position in mining chemical. 
And when we look at composites, strong position in aerospace. I mean, Composites today are a key element in the design of the newest generation of planes, but Composites is also an important element in the secondary structure of all currently produced airplanes. And Cytec was able to take another 2 global position in this market. 
Second important market for composites is automotive. Today, it's still a bit of a niche market, focused on very high-end vehicles or niche vehicles, mainly Ferraris, Lamborghinis or a very innovative vehicle like the BMW i3. These are made of composites. But there's really an opportunity to introduce composites in larger-volume vehicle, and this is something on which Cytec has been working, and we do believe that Solvay and Cytec's knowledge about the OEM market will allow us to be an effective partner in the introduction of these new technologies in larger volume vehicles. 
When it comes to mining chemicals, what Cytec does is bring the chemicals which allow to optimize the extraction of ore from the minerals which are being mined. And this is a very important element in the mining process, something which allows to improve our recovery, something which allows to limit the environmental impact. 
And whatever I would say the price of this commodities are, Cytec business is very much linked to volumes of production, and we are very confident if you look at copper, if you look at alumina, that indeed, the needs are growing. And Cytec's position in this business will benefit from this. 
And by the way, this is a very service-oriented business. Cytec people are on the mine sites working hands on hands with the engineers, working on ore extraction and treatment, and this is a business model which is very close to what we do in similar segments within Novecare.
So moving to Slide 8, just to give you a bit more color. I told you 2/3 of Cytec business in composites, aerospace materials representing EUR 1 billion of sales so 50% of Cytec sales. Cytec is selling to all the big names in commercial aircraft, so with stronger focus on Boeing but a presence with Airbus and the players in regional and smaller Jets. Cytec has made an entry into engines with Safran LEAP engine. And Cytec has also a presence in military aircraft and helicopters. 
Industrial materials using Cytec terminology, this is really the automotive market with a position in supercars plus a few other smaller segments. And there clearly the challenge is to participate in the development of composites as a new technology being used to develop lighter, more fuel efficient vehicle. 
In-process separation, this is the name of the mining chemical business. As I was describing, strong focus on copper and alumina, with technologies which allow us to optimize the output of ore. And again, a very close link with customers, which creates very significant barrier of entries.
So moving to how Solvay will look post-Cytec transaction. You see that in terms of exposure to different markets, we will significantly increase our exposure to automotive and aerospace. And this is something which is important because we consider that these 2 markets offer very interesting opportunities. 
And in terms of geography, we will refocus a bit more in North America, which post-transaction will represent 26% of our sales, which means that Solvay will become indeed an even more global chemical company than we were before. 
So these were really the headlines in terms of strategy, and I would like now to turn to Roger so that he can lead us through the market opportunities and the business case."
377837,306823230,871616,"Solvay SA, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Okay. Good morning, everyone. Yes, I'm going to try to take the overview that Jean-Pierre just gave and go into a bit more detail in the key markets they serve, give you a little bit more color on where they sit today. And we'll make a comment on where th",3696,"Okay. Good morning, everyone. Yes, I'm going to try to take the overview that Jean-Pierre just gave and go into a bit more detail in the key markets they serve, give you a little bit more color on where they sit today. And we'll make a comment on where the Solvay plus Cytec mix leads us into these positions. 
So if we look over on Slide 11, we start with an attractive opportunity in composites. And just in general, what are we talking about when we talk about composites? This is a very lightweight yet very strong material. And so this is actually something fundamentally tied to what we do already in specialty polymers. The idea of replacing metal with very high-technology plastics is something we do every day in Specialty Polymers. And this composites piece fits very, very well in that mindset and in that way of working. 
So w believe that this is a trend that's going to continue for quite a long time in this continual push to replace metals with lighter weight materials. When we look at this market, we see really double-digit growth rates in 2 key areas, and that is in aerospace and in automotive, which happens to be the 2 areas that Cytec is focused on. Still good growth in things like wind power and that is a market they serve, but we're going to focus today on aerospace today and automotive as the market of tomorrow.
So if we take a little bit of a deep dive into aerospace for a minute, I'll move over to Page 12. What you'll see here is on this drawing, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, the parts in blue are what are called secondary structures. Those are parts that have been on planes and yet growing on planes for many, many years. 
As we look at the new developments that are coming on, new projects like the A350 from Airbus or the 787 from Boeing, we are starting to move from airplanes with 5% to 10% composite structure, up to the new designs, which now have 50%-plus composites in the structure. So this is an absolute step change in the way in which planes are built and the materials that are used inside these planes. And so this is one of the key drivers that we see in the growth of aerospace for the coming years, even decades is this move to airplanes with a significantly higher percentage of composites in their construction.
The other thing we see here a little bit on this slide is that Cytec today has a clear #2 position in this market. They have been extremely strong in secondary structures for many, many years. And they are now moving to become a real player in the primary structures. Today, they have a position already in military aircraft, in commercial aircraft, in primary structures. They've mentioned before in their press releases, they believe they are very well situated to get a primary structure position on the Boeing 777X that continues to move them into a new area with future growth potential.
2 drivers of growth in aerospace: one is the more composites per plane, but the second piece that we need clearly is that there is a huge backlog of orders today in aerospace. There is a nearly 8-year backlog at current production rates from simply Boeing and Airbus of the world. Their focus today is on trying to determine how can they make more planes per year, because if you look at the production rate that is planned today all the way out to 2020, they would be able to deliver less than half of the planes in the backlog today. 
So this is a key need of this market, which is to determine how to make planes faster. And this mix of needing more planes, making them faster and more composites per plane lead us to believe very strongly in this double-digit growth in the aerospace market. 
Cytec is very well placed with all the major customers in aerospace. And we believe this has actually a very strong point that will help us when I mentioned here a little bit what does Solvay plus Cytec bring. This is going to be very helpful for developing our sales in Specialty Polymers. 
We have introduced and we showed a little bit at the Capital Markets Day several new products aimed at aerospace using thermoplastic composites, using foams. We believe having the credibility, the client intimacy, the ability to sit down with the designers and decision-makers in these large aerospace customers to show them not only what we can do from a thermoset point of view at Cytec but also a thermoplastic point of Solvay, is going to be a very strong position and a very key component of becoming more of a driver and more of a partner with the development. So overall, we see double-digit growth in automotive, lasting a very long time. 
If you look at a little bit the barriers to entry, this is a market where it takes significant work to get specified. But once you're specified, normally, you're in there for the life of the platform. And when we talk about life of a platform, just as an example, the Boeing 737 was launched in 1967. And I mean, the single-aisle planes are still the bread and butter of the Boeing and Airbus. So we see these as very long life, very resilient types of markets. 
We did quite a bit of study in looking over the last 20 years of what's gone on in this industry. And if I take back even to a period in the crisis of 2009, what you see is the backlog slows down or drops, but the production rate, in fact, continue on because the amount of need is -- far exceed the ability of supply. 
So all that to say we believe that the aerospace business is a very attractive, very resilient, and this will help us develop not only continue the Cytec strength but develop also our Specialty Polymers strength. 
So if I take aerospace as the really the market of today, I'll shift gears a little bit and let's talk about automotive as what we see as the market of tomorrow. We are really excited to look at what Cytec has been doing to prepare an ecosystem, I would say, to be able to serve this automotive market. 
And currently today, automotive is a key part of the Solvay portfolio, especially in Specialty Polymers and Engineering Plastics, where we work every day developing solutions in automobiles to make them lighter, more fuel efficient. 
This market is being driven by, I would say, basically by planetary need. Our need to move the world's population around but to have a less impact from CO2, and it's certainly supported by regulations. The United States CAFE standards that have been put in place that mandate much more fuel efficient cars if you want to sell cars in the United States, is a major driver for this. 
In the European Union, we see continued push for further CO2 emission reductions by 2020. Just to give you an example, in 2002, the regulations were at 260 grams of CO2 per kilometer. They're moving to 90 grams CO2 per kilometer. So we really are cutting by almost -- to 1/3 the level of where we can be on emission regulations. These regulations are driving the automotive manufacturers to look for solutions to make the cars still strong but very light. And that's where this mix of composites comes in to be a real solution provider for that automotive industry.
And it's this mix of very lightweight materials, yet maintaining very good strength, which makes this product, I would say, technically capable of becoming used in larger cars, larger serial cars. What we need to do today is to really work on the manufacturing processes, to make these products available at higher speeds, at higher outputs and reduce that system cost. That is a need of the industry and there are many people working on it, but we really believe that the mix of Cytec plus Solvay puts us in a very good position to be a partner of choice for that. 
We show on the graph a little bit the growth rates, 50% compounded growth a year from '10 to '20. Clearly, that's starting from a small base. But what we can say so far is from '10 to '15, we're seeing this, so this is real. We're seeing this kind of growth. And we believe we're really coming up to a tipping point, and a tipping point by which this growth would be much, much larger in the future. 
So we see automotive as a key market for the future. I would say today, we don't have a tremendous amount of this in the business plan. This is really an upside position for us. But we believe the world's going there, and this puts us in a very good position to be credible and bring solutions.
So on Slide 14, you'll see a little bit what Jean-Pierre mentioned. These materials are used today in very high-end cars. If you happen to own a Formula 1 or a Lamborghini, you're driving this every day. For the rest of us, we believe that there's work to do to help this move to first, serial production of quite high-end cars. I believe that's really the next step in which we'll be going in this market and this industry will be moving to. 
As I mentioned, we need to change the manufacturing processes, and this will take not only a material, but it will take links with those who are designing, those who are creating the processes. And the ecosystem that Cytec's been working on with not only the automotive companies but with engineering design houses. Even taking equity positions in engineering design houses sets them up well to succeed in this. 
So we look forward for Solvay and Cytec together to taking the extremely strong position we have in automotive, the relationship throughout the value chain in automotive, the credibility that Solvay has in the automotive industry and bringing in and introducing Cytec's products. So automotive, the market of tomorrow, is an upside in this deal that we'll work very hard to make sure we deliver.
The third main market that Jean-Pierre mentioned that we'll talk about is this idea of mining chemicals. When we put this to maybe -- to be more clear on what this is, we have a bit of an addiction today as a world. On our smart devices, on our technology that ties us together and these require mined elements. 
And so the business that Cytec has is creating surfactants and materials which allow the separation of the metal from the rest of the waste that you get when you mine. This is a market that's heavily focused first on copper, so they have about 45% of their business in copper. And second in alumina, 25% of their market is in alumina. 
Both of these elements are extremely needed today. And what we see in the last several years is a demand that is increasing for the chemicals needed to produce these. There are 2 drivers of the demand on chemicals. One is clearly the volume of material that's needed in the world. So as the volumes increase, certainly, that drives a demand for increased chemicals. 
But a second demand, which is actually we're seeing maybe even more important today is that the quality of the ore slowly deteriorates. And as we mine around the world, we take the nice ore first, and over time, it gets more and more difficult to find good mines. As a quality of the ore deteriorates, this idea of being more effective and more efficient in getting the material out of the mix becomes even more important. 
And so what we're seeing is a demand that is increasing over time for these innovative materials, which allow the efficiency and the effectiveness to increase. And in fact, it allows a mine to stay in life longer, so that rather than needing to create a brand new greenfield mine, which is extremely important, our customers can continue to push and squeeze out more from existing mines using these materials and this technology. 
It's a business model that we're well aware of. It's a business model in which you have people at the mines, technical service helping to solve the problems, watching how it works day-to-day. And so it's very much a customer-touching, business-focused, I would call it a service business model that leverages the use of the chemicals that you're making in your sites on site with the users of the materials. 
So we believe this is a good business for us. We believe it reinforces our Advanced Formulations and our Novecare business quite strongly. And in fact, this mix of Solvay plus Cytec really enhances our leadership globally and what I would say natural resource chemicals. And so as we continue to drive natural resources out of the ground, it will become more and more rigorous, more and more environmentally sensitive. And we believe this is a place where we can add value and mix with Novecare plus what Cytec has is a very strong powerful mix.
So I mentioned a little bit the 3 main markets that we're focused on. Aerospace today, automotive tomorrow and the mining mixed with our energy resources of Novecare. But there's an intangible also when I look at this deal is that how do these businesses fit together? 
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, we started already 18 months ago when we were discussing the transformation of Solvay of what type of businesses we would want to bring into our portfolio. We screened hundreds of chemical and advanced materials companies from around the world. 
And as we really narrowed this down to just a very small handful, Cytec started to rise above the crowd and for 2 reasons for us: one, it's a very unique opportunity for us to reinforce both of our growth engines. So from making one single acquisition and one single integration to buy a company that reinforces very strongly our Advanced Materials cluster with the aerospace focus with the composites, and yet at the same time has a sister business that perfectly fits inside our Advanced Formulations business. 
So for us, this was a perfect fit to bring in to reinforce both growth engines. And quite honestly, there's little to nothing at Cytec that today we would say we have to get rid of because in fact, it fits very well in our portfolio. And this was a differentiator on this business, both in terms of fit inside the company and in terms of creation of synergies. We believe that this fit allows us to have a stronger lever on synergy potential than many of the other companies we looked at.
From a culture point of view, we've been able to have some significant discussions with Cytec in the past few weeks. What we found is people of a culture that would be very similar to Solvay, a people of a culture who understand the way to do business and taking intimacy with our customers, understanding their needs and replacing metal with very lightweight combinations. We understand that very well. 
And so I think they're going to fit extremely well into our business. As we mentioned on Slide 16, we will take the aerospace composite piece and put it in the Advanced Materials segment, and we will take the in-process separation, additive technologies piece and put it into the formation segment. So they will be housed in a structure in which they have very similar businesses around them.
What I would say a little bit on the culture as well that a little bit of the intangible. One of the items that's extremely important in a Cytec-type business is a focus on quality and minimization of waste and making sure that it's right the first time. So we have found in Cytec an extremely strong Six Sigma culture, an extremely strong focus on quality that actually, we believe, will be very good to help stretch us in, I would say, Solvay legacy businesses. 
On the other side, over the last few years, we have been developing an extremely strong focus on manufacturing excellence, on operational excellence or commercial excellence. And we believe the focus of Solvay on excellence, blended with the focus of Cytec on -- from a Six Sigma quality point of view, will be a very strong lever in continuing to drive the performance in this combined business. 
So overall, we see this fitting really hand-in-glove with our business, a perfect strategic fit, really a unique opportunity. We did not find others that brought this, to strengthen our growth engines and to deliver for us a level of performance that exceeds where we have been in the past. So putting all that together, we believe this is a very strong project for us. 
There is one more intangible that really came to us more as we got deeper into this business, understand -- understood much more about the business in our presentations and discussions with the management, is an idea of a technical know-how and extremely strong complementarity in technology. 
Cytec's aerospace thermoset materials is their bread and butter. They have been working to try to develop new thermoplastics for aerospace. This is a perfect complementarity to Specialty Polymers. And by putting these teams together, we believe that the technology bases we have in these 2 businesses will drive future growth that is not at all in our business plan. 
I mentioned this technology in automotive that we need to change and develop a new process, falls very well with the strong position of Specialty Polymers, we will drive that together. 
And the mining and phosphine chemicals, we specifically mentioned mining. There are other parts of the Cytec business that are very nice business, very nice value-added, very nice margins, in the use of phosphine chemicals, that leverage very well with Novecare's current existing phosphine-based formulations. So we believe there's technology synergies that will drive new products and innovation and growth in the future that once again is an upside, that is not in our business plan today.
So one of the designs of our strategy in Solvay has been very clear, to focus on sustainability. And why do we want to talk about sustainability? We've made a very strong decision to say that if we are going to be investing, whether that is in CapEx, whether that is in new markets, whether that is in acquisitions, we want to make sure that those investments are in markets that will be there long term and that have very strong growth drivers long term. Thus, they need to be sustainable. 
So when we find markets that are desperately needed by the planet, that offer solutions that support these changes in regulations to help drive that, we believe that's a very long range, resilient, sustainable market, and we believe we found that with Cytec. And so when we really look at these solutions that Cytec is bringing, it's really responding to the stringent regulatory environment, we believe, that's only going in one direction, the environmental regulations will become more and more stringent. And so this is a key area of ours that we believe is a very long-term driver.
So let's talk a moment on synergies. Synergies is a key aspect of this deal, and in fact, we have been working on this, as I mentioned, for 18 months. And a question of what kind of deal can we create where we can be confident and deliver the synergies was key. When we did, looking at Cytec, we've done a really an in-depth analysis. We've worked for months with several consultants who know Cytec extremely well, with industry consultants. 
We've worked with our own experts. We had tested this with banks. We've tested it with others to see -- have great confidence in our ability to deliver these synergies. This is a line-by-line synergy plan. This is not a percent of sales. We've gone into great detail with this. And the main part of this is clearly cost synergies. We've identified over EUR 100 million of annual recurring synergies. This is really on the low side of our range, but this is identified, heavily focused on certainly general administrative, simply delisting a company in the U.S., simplifying the corporate structure. Those are all very big pieces. 
We see certainly advantages in purchasing glass fiber. These are products that we use every day in many of our businesses. We believe that the excellence practices that I mentioned earlier will allow us to drive still significant gains. And if we take simply the experience we've had in Specialty Polymers in the last 3 years, it gives us tremendous confidence to deliver those. 
So cost synergies are, by far, the largest part of what we're talking about here. We have identified line by line and we believe that we can realize a substantial part of these by year 3. We do have an implementation cost of about EUR 75 million over the first 2 years to drive this. 
On top of the cost synergies, which is, by far, what we have here in the main part, we do see revenue synergies, as I mentioned, in this complementarity between Specialty Polymers lightweight position in aerospace, moving Cytec faster into automotive and the cross-selling opportunities with Novecare. So all in all, we have a very strong belief we will deliver these synergies. 
Last piece is that Cytec is just finalizing their ERP process, which for the first time will give us the data to really put in place as well our commercial excellence synergies, our more sophisticated pricing mechanisms, and that will be a key driver of growth as well. So overall, we love the deal. We think it's very good and unique."

Let me start by just stating to you that yesterday's share price for Cytec closed at $58.39. Our cash offer of $75.25 equates to a premium of just under 29% based on yesterday's price, 26.9% if we look at a 3-month average. That's the fact. 
As you look at that and you see the enterprise value of $6.4 billion, it's actually worthwhile to take a step back and remembering that companies that have a predictable, sustainable, high sales growth, high earnings growth trajectory typically trade at a much higher multiple than companies that don't. That is a fact. Why? Because we like resilience and growth combined together. This is why the offer that we're putting on the table equates to 14.7x the consensus 2015 EBITDA, excluding synergies, including, as Roger said, our conservative view of the synergies, it's 11.7x.
This is a cash merger that only requires a simple majority vote by Cytec's shareholders. The closing conditions are very standard and customary, and we have high confidence this will be achieved.
I'd like to highlight one thing in particular as well, and that is that our reference shareholder, Solvac, that owns 30.2% of our shares, are very supportive of this deal. And for the first time ever, they've confirmed this morning that they will take up their rights in our eventual capital increase.
What's the impact on Solvay going to be? I'd like to remind you, just as Jean-Pierre did, in June, we talked about value. Value, we look at with 3 lenses: earnings growth, cash conversion and returns. I'll take them in turn. 
This deal will improve our REBITDA margin. This transaction will improve our capacity to grow REBITDA. That momentum will be much more sustainable and will really enhance what we have. 
Adjusted EPS will be positive after year 1. It would enhance our free cash flow, and our returns will be accretive though in the medium term, which is very normal, given the significant goodwill that, as you know, we conservatively add into our CFROI calculation. So the blend of high returns, cash conversion and returns absolutely give us the conviction this is a very strong and value-creating deal. And as you're aware, that has obviously been recommended unanimously by Cytec's board as well. 
So how are we going to fund this? Well, first and foremost, we've secured $5.8 billion of bridge financing for 100% of the needs to buy the equity. That bridge financing is available for 2 years. We've also secured contingent hedges to really ensure that we can protect the euro cost essentially, the dollar cost of this acquisition as well through hedges. So again, what we've tried to do is to make sure that we secured the funding and protected the pricing. Security at low cost has also driven that particular strategy.
On closing, we are looking clearly at a capital structure, and as you can see in front of you, EUR 1.5 billion of equity, EUR 1 billion of hybrid and the balance will come in senior debt, which will be U.S. dollar-denominated. It will be a blend of U.S. native bonds and Eurobonds swapped into dollars. We'll decide and we'll find the precise blend and the tenors nearer the time, given the market conditions. 
Now why do you see that capital structure? Essentially, we have 1 simple goal: absolutely committed to maintaining our investment grade and also to do so that remain efficient and cautious. And that requires us to almost optimize and minimize the equity and maximize the use of debt once we're achieving that balance between caution and value. 
The dollar debt costs a little more obviously than euro-denominated debt, but it makes a lot of sense because it gives us a natural hedge by blending basically the funding cost with the other debt with the cash flows to our dollar debt as well. 
We fully expect rating agencies to confirm during the course of the next day that we will maintain our investment grade ratings on close. And in fact, we also anticipate some very, very positive comments on how they see this enhancement of this deal on our business profile. 
This is how we're going to pay for it. Fundamentally, the value expect to generate will enable us to maintain a long-standing policy of stable to growing dividends. That is really important to us. Rewarding our shareholders is obviously driver for Solvay. 
Now I talked about or we've talked about strong track record. I'd like to add 1 or 2 facts to those you see on Page 23. Historically, Cytec has grown over the period 2012 to 2015. It has grown its sales by 12.6% compound annual growth rate. Its REBITDA has grown by 18%, 18.4% to be precise. If I looked at the market expectations, the analysts that follow the company, they also predict very strong double-digit earnings growth and I think 9% sales growth looking forward. This is very, very attractive.
What we anticipate on a pro forma basis, clearly, if you consider that history will have a tendency to repeat itself, we expect improvement potential, absolutely our confidence of the margin enhancement with an eventual -- I'm going to come back to eventual high cash generation. 
I'd like to focus for a moment or 2 on the CapEx. There are times if you look at 2013 quite a significant jump in CapEx relative to Cytec. This is a feature of this business, whereby where there are strong contractual demand by customers, particularly in aeronautics, you invest in that. There's a very strong quality and predictability of the earnings that come from these investments. We will absolutely ensure that we can accompany the needs of the customer of Cytec to grow that value. And fundamentally, this will result in a very strong cash conversion. 
With that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

So maybe just a few words before we open to questions. So for us clearly, the key headline is that with this acquisition, we immediately get the $1 billion position as a key supplier of Advanced Materials to the aerospace industry. And for us, this is clearly a major step in a market where we see a lot of potentials with composites but also with our Specialty Polymers businesses. 
We strengthen both of Solvay growth engines. We improve our sustainability offering and our environmental profile. And indeed, this provides very significant earnings momentum, and this creates value for our shareholders. And by the way, just to insist on the fact that our reference shareholder, Solvac, has just announced that they will be supporting the project and that they will participate in the rights issue.
So for us, I think that the combination of Solvay and Cytec creates a platform which will allow us to continue and to accelerate our portfolio reshaping. And indeed in the next couple of years, the group profile will demonstrate that we have the ability to grow significantly, that we have improved our resilience tremendously and that we can indeed generate higher returns.

Moving forward, it's back to normal in the next few weeks and seeing that we are seeing a demand picking up, again very much in line with the expectation we had. On Novecare, more prudent. I think oil prices of continue to be quite volatile.

Fundamentally, this balance sheet is sustainable. We cannot absolutely service the debt at the high levels and eventually pay down debt if we choose to.

Want to make the math, I use the consensus Solvay this year. It's EUR 2 billion.

So maybe time just to bring this call to conclusion. Thank you very much for your time. I think we have -- we are very pleased with the Cytec acquisition. To come up with what I think is a great strategic opportunity for Solvay. It's really a milestone in the transformation of a portfolio of the company but this is not the endgame. We -- I do believe I said it several times in several ways that on the contrary, this is really a trigger for us to continue and to accelerate the portfolio reshaping with really a view to turn, as we will conclude the integration of Cytec, to turn Solvay into indeed a group with a different profile than the one it had a few years ago, much more focused around growth, much more resilient and with significantly higher returns for its shareholders.

Sorry for the change of schedule, but we had a feeling that with all the news we have to share with you today, it was better to organize it as early as possible in the morning. 
So I'm here with Karim Hajjar, our CFO; and Roger Kearns, who is the member of the Executive Committee who is currently supervising the Advanced Materials cluster and who is playing a key role in the Cytec integration project.
So what I suggest is to spend a few minutes to go over the Q2 results, which, by the way, are pretty, in my view, at least, simple and straightforward, and then move into a full presentation of the Cytec project, which, by the way, is for me, a major milestone in the transformation of Solvay. And then we'll open to Q&A.
So quick overview of our results. Very similar -- Q2 very similar to Q1. We were able to post a solid 8% REBITDA increase versus last year, which means EUR 500 million of REBITDA. Sales up 4%; margin, 19%, 66 basis points of improvement, so overall solid. 
When we look at the components, clearly, we've benefited very much from ForEx, EUR 55 million of impact in this quarter, EUR 100 million of positive impact from ForEx for the full half year. Volumes were down, slightly, but down. In fact, if -- when we look across the board, we see 3 different situations, 2 specific issues, businesses where we have significant volume shortfalls, no surprises. Novecare oil and gas segment still at a very low level. Information there is not always simple to put together. We continue to see strong production of tight oil and shale gas in the U.S. but little exploration activities. We see transformation in the supply chain. We think that we are strengthening our positions, but in a market where volumes are minimal.
Acetow, still feeling the impact of the destocking that started last year in China, although a slight improvement at the end of the quarter, which gives us a bit of hope that the situation will improve during the second half of the year. 
We have businesses which are doing very well, mostly the Advanced Materials cluster, where we have strong volume dynamic, which is based on innovation. And then, very strong pricing power across the board, EUR 57 million of impact in Q2, EUR 90 million for the first half, which means that even in markets where we are suffering from low volumes, we are able to defend prices and margins. And this, by the way, has been a feature for Solvay for many years. We put, clearly, price before volume, and I think that this strategy is paying off. 
If you look at our segments, 3 of our 4 segments are showing very solid REBITDA improvement. Advanced Formulations is the only one which is down 12%, mostly linked to the oil and gas situation in Novecare that I was mentioning, unfortunately, not helped by Coatis. The Brazilian situation is -- Brazil is, really, the only region of the world where we see a very challenging macro environment, Aroma being a bit more positive. 
Advanced Materials is really the star segment, if I may say so. 18% REBITDA improvement, another record; 9% volume dynamic and this is fully based on innovation, smart devices, lightweighting of various sorts. Ryton integration is also going well. 
Performance Chemicals, up 9%, which is a very good performance despite the Acetow situation I was referring to. Solid pricing in soda ash and peroxide allowed us to achieve this result, and excellence initiatives are continuing to be the strong performance driver in this cluster. 
And then, Functional Polymers, up 23%. Market fundamentals are improving for our Polyamide business, both on the raw material and energy cost side but also on the market. And on top of this, the excellence initiatives that we have aggressively developed within this cluster are also paying off. 
Significant cash flow generation, EUR 167 million for the quarter. So it shows that we are still very much focused on cash. So overall, solid results for Q2, which allow us to confirm our previous guidance, which call for strong growth of our REBITDA in 2015 versus 2014.
We've made also some progress in the portfolio during the -- during this second quarter. Obviously, the -- we are all expecting the finalization of our PVC Europe deal. INOVYN is -- was indeed created July 1. It's really -- has been a very long, very painful project, but we've stayed very committed to it, and we are very pleased to see that the divestiture of this PVC -- European PVC business is now becoming a reality. You know that we have already an exit, which is very well defined 3 years down the road, and for us, this was really the best possible way to exit from this European PVC business while maximizing the positive impact for various stakeholders. 
But again, talking about portfolio, the key issue today is the presentation of the Cytec project, which, in our view, is an incredibly powerful opportunity to continue our portfolio transformation. I will now -- I suggest that you follow this presentation on the -- using the documents that we've made available. So you've seen the conference details link, which will allow you to follow the -- to follow this presentation. And I will try to refer to the slides I'm using to make it as clear as possible.
So we -- after some careful consideration, we considered that Cytec was indeed a perfect fit with Solvay's strategy, and we will try to explain you why. I will give you another view of the strategic rationale representation. Roger will develop the business case and the very significant opportunities we see on the 2 markets where Cytec will help us become a very significant player. And obviously, Karim will come on the transaction details and the financial impact.
So starting on Slide 5. I mean, since I took over as the CEO of Solvay, I told you that we will be transforming our portfolio quite aggressively. So 2011, the Rhodia acquisition; 2013, Chemlogics; '14, Ryton. We started also some divestiture: Eco Services in '14; INOVYN JV, I just referred to it, in '15. We are still working to finalize the exit of our Latin American PVC business. 
And today, we're seeing that Cytec is, again, a major milestone. Very much aligned, by the way, with what I was telling you in the conclusion of our Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago. I was mentioning that our objective in 2015 was to accelerate the transformation, and I'm very pleased to see that a few weeks after, we are indeed coming to share with you this very important project. 
You've seen on Slide 5 the small matrix that we are using to present our portfolio, with value-creation potential and ability to extract values of our various businesses. Clearly, for us, Cytec is on the upper right-hand corner, and this is the direction in which we are driving Solvay's portfolio. 
And by the way, Cytec is not the final transaction regarding our portfolio. We think that we need to continue portfolio adjustment, portfolio changes, and Cytec is probably a great opportunity for us to continue to look at what can be done to improve the quality of our portfolio. 
The strategic fit for us is excellent. Just by this acquisition, Solvay will become the world #2 largest player in aerospace composite materials. This acquisition strengthens very much our Advanced Materials approach. You've heard us saying that lightweighting is a key driver for the growth of Advanced Materials. We lacked a position in composites. Thanks to Cytec, we are becoming immediately a leader in composites. 
On the Advanced Formulations segment, same impact. Cytec is a global leader in mining chemical business, and we'll explain you later on why we think this mining chemical business is a great business. And thanks to Cytec and the integration of Cytec activities with Novecare, we will strengthen very significantly our position in mining and oil and gas.
Cytec is a company which is very much innovation-driven, very close to customers. Lightweighting but also mining chemicals allow customer to meet more effectively the sustainability challenges, and this is, for us, a very important driver in our strategy, too. 
From a financial standpoint, we will be able to strengthen our earnings momentum. We are very determined to extract pretax synergies of more than EUR 100 million per year, and this acquisition will be adjusted-EPS-accretive after year 1. 
And when we look at the objectives we had in the transformation of Solvay that we have stated several times, I think, we tick all the boxes. Cytec will bring us growth, Cytec will bring us resilience and Cytec will bring us improved returns.
Moving on Slide 7, just to give you a bit more flavor of who Cytec is. Cytec is a $2 billion company, 20% REBITDA margin, 4,600 employees, 29 sites, with a strong focus on composites, which represent 2/3 of Cytec's activities, 1/3 being their position in mining chemical. 
And when we look [ph] at composites, strong position in aerospace. I mean, composites today are a key element in the design of the newest generation of planes, but composites is also an important element in the secondary structure of all currently produced airplanes. And Cytec was able to take a #2 global position in this market. 
Second important market for composites is automotive. Today, it's still a bit of a niche market, focused on very high-end vehicles or niche vehicles, mainly Ferraris, Lamborghinis or a very innovative vehicle like the BMW i3. These are made of composites. But there's really an opportunity to introduce composites in larger-volume vehicle, and this is something on which Cytec has been working, and we do believe that Solvay and Cytec's knowledge about the OEM market will allow us to be an effective partner in the introduction of these new technologies in larger-volume vehicles. 
When it comes to mining chemical, what Cytec does is bring the chemicals which allow it to optimize the extraction of ore from the minerals which are being mined. And this is a very important element in the mining process, something which allows to improve our recovery, something which allows to limit the environmental impact. 
And whatever, I would say, the price of these commodities are, Cytec business is very much linked to volumes of production, and we are very confident, if we look at copper, if you look at -- if we look at alumina, that indeed, the needs are growing. And Cytec's position in this business will benefit from this. 
And by the way, this is a very service-oriented business. Cytec people are on the mine sites working hands on hands with the engineers who are working on ore extraction and treatment, and this is a business model which is very close to what we do in other -- or similar segments within Novecare.
So moving to Slide 8. Just to give you a bit more color, I told you, 2/3 of Cytec business in composites, aerospace materials representing EUR 1 billion of sales, so 50% of Cytec sales. Cytec is selling to all the big names in commercial aircraft. So with stronger focus on Boeing, but a presence with Airbus and the players in regional and smaller Jets. Cytec has made an entry into engines with Safran LEAP engine, and Cytec has also a presence in military aircraft and helicopters. 
Industrial materials, using Cytec terminology, this is really the automotive market with a position in supercars plus a few other smaller segments. And there, clearly, the challenge is to participate in the development of composites as a new technology being used to develop lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicle. 
In-process separation, this is the name of the mining chemical business, as I was describing, strong focus on copper and alumina, with technologies which allow us to optimize the output of ore. And again, a very close link with customers, which create very significant barrier of entries.
So moving to how Solvay will look post-Cytec transaction. You see that, in terms of exposure to different markets, we will significantly increase our exposure to automotive and aerospace, and this is something which is important, because we consider that these 2 markets offer very interesting opportunities. 
And in terms of geography, we will refocus a bit more in North America, which, post-transaction, will represent 26% of our sales, which means that Solvay will become, indeed, an even more global chemical company than we were before. 
So these were really the headlines in terms of strategy, and I would like now to turn to Roger so that he can lead us through the market opportunities and the business case."

Good morning, everyone. Yes, I'm going to try to take the overview that Jean-Pierre just gave and go into a bit more detail in the key markets they serve, give you a little bit more color on where they sit today, and we'll make a comment on where the Solvay-plus-Cytec mix leads us into these positions. 
So if we look over on Slide 11, we start with an attractive opportunity in composites. And just in general, what are we talking about when we talk about composites? This is a very lightweight yet very strong material. And so this is actually something fundamentally tied to what we do already in specialty polymers. The idea of replacing metal with a very high-technology plastics is something we do every day in Specialty Polymers, and this composites piece fits very, very well in that mindset and in that way of working. 
So we believe that this is a trend that's going to continue for quite a long time in this continual push to replace metals with lighter-weight materials. 
When we look at this market, we see, really, double-digit growth rates in 2 key areas, and that is in aerospace and in automotive, which happens to be the 2 areas that Cytec is focused on. Still good growth in things like wind power, and that is a market they serve, but we're going to focus today -- on aerospace today and automotive as the market of tomorrow.
So if we take a little bit of a deep dive into aerospace for a minute, I'll move over to Page 12. What you'll see here is, on this drawing, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, the parts in blue are what are called secondary structures. Those are parts that have been on planes and yet growing on planes for many, many years. 
As we look at the new developments that are coming on, new projects like the A350 from Airbus or the 787 from Boeing, we are starting to move from airplanes with 5% to 10% composite structure up to the new designs, which now have 50%-plus composites in the structure. So this is an absolute step-change in the way in which planes are built and the materials that are used inside these planes. And so this is one of the key drivers that we see in the growth of aerospace for the coming years, even decades, is this move to airplanes with a significantly higher percentage of composites in their construction.
The other thing we see here a little bit on this slide is that Cytec today has a clear #2 position in this market. They have been extremely strong in secondary structures for many, many years, and they are now moving to become a real player in the primary structures. Today, they have a position already in military aircraft, in commercial aircraft, in primary structures. They'd mentioned before in their press releases, they believe they are very well situated to get a primary structure position on the Boeing 777X that continues to move them into a new area with future growth potential.
Two drivers of growth in aerospace: one is the -- more composites per plane, but the second piece that we need -- leat's go back. The second piece that we need, clearly, is that there is a huge backlog of orders today in aerospace. There is a nearly 8-year backlog at current production rates from simply the Boeing and Airbus of the world. Their focus today is on trying to determine how can they make more planes per year, because if you look at the production rate that is planned today all the way out to 2020, they would be able to deliver less than half of the planes in the backlog today. 
So this is a key need of this market, which is to determine how to make planes faster. And this mix of needing more planes, making them faster and more composites per plane leads us to believe very strongly in this double-digit growth in the aerospace market. 
Cytec is very well placed with all the major customers in aerospace. And we believe this is actually a very strong point that will help us. When I mentioned here a little bit, what does Solvay plus Cytec bring? This is going to be very helpful for developing our sales in Specialty Polymers. 
We have introduced and we showed a little bit at the Capital Markets Day several new products aimed at aerospace using thermoplastic composites, using foams. We believe having the credibility, the client intimacy, the ability to sit down with the designers and decision-makers in these large aerospace customers to show them not only what we can do from a thermoset point of view at Cytec, but also a thermoplastic point of Solvay, is going to be a very strong position and a very key component of becoming more of a driver and more of a partner with the development. So overall, we see double-digit growth in automotive lasting a very long time. 
If you look at a little bit the barriers to entry, this is a market where it takes significant work to get specified. But once you're specified, normally, you are in there for the life of the platform. And when we talk about life of a platform, just as an example, the Boeing 737 was launched in 1967. And I mean, the single-aisle planes are still the bread and butter of a Boeing and Airbus. So we see these as very long life, very resilient types of markets. 
We did quite a bit of study and looking over the last 20 years of what's gone on in this industry. And if I take back even to a period in the crisis of 2009, what you see is the backlog slows down or drops, but the production rate, in fact, continue on, because the amount of need is -- far exceeds the ability to supply. 
So all that to say we believe that the aerospace business is very attractive, very resilient, and this will help us develop -- not only continue the Cytec strength but develop also our Specialty Polymers strength. 
So if I take aerospace as the -- really, the markets of today, I'll shift gears a little bit, and let's talk about automotive as what we see as the markets of tomorrow. We are really excited to look at what Cytec has been doing to prepare an ecosystem, I would say, to be able to serve this automotive market. 
And currently, today, automotive is the key part of the Solvay portfolio, especially in Specialty Polymers and Engineering Plastics, where we work every day developing solutions in automobiles to make them lighter, more fuel-efficient. 
This market is being driven by, I would say, basically, by planetary need. Our need to move the world's population around but to have less impact from CO2, and it's certainly supported by regulations. The United States CAFE standards that had been put in place that mandate much more fuel-efficient cars, if you want to sell cars in the United States, is a major driver for this. 
In the European Union, we see continued push for further CO2 emission reductions by 2020. Just to give you an example, in 2002, the regulations were at 260 grams of CO2 per kilometer. They're moving to 90 grams CO2 per kilometer. So we really are cutting by almost -- to 1/3 the level of where we can be on emission regulations. These regulations are driving the automotive manufacturers to look for solutions to make the cars still strong but very light, and that's where this mix of composites comes in to be a real solution provider for that automotive industry.
And it's this mix of very lightweight materials, yet maintaining very good strength, which makes this product, I would say, technically capable of becoming used in larger cars, larger serial cars. What we need to do today is to really work on the manufacturing processes to make these products available at higher speeds, at higher outputs and reduce that system cost. That is a need of the industry, and there are many people working on it, but we really believe that the mix of Cytec plus Solvay puts us in a very good position to be a partner of choice for that. 
We show on the graph a little bit the growth rates. So 50% compounded growth a year from '10 to '20. Clearly, that's starting from a small base. But what we can say so far is from '10 to '15, we're seeing this. So this is real. We're seeing this kind of growth. And we believe we're really coming up to a tipping point, and a tipping point by which this growth would be much, much larger in the future. 
So we see automotive as a -- is a key market for the future. I would say, today, we don't have a tremendous amount of this in the business plan. This is really an upside position for us. But we believe the world's going there, and this puts us in a very good position to be credible and bring solutions.
So on Slide 14, you'll see a little bit what Jean-Pierre mentioned. These materials are used today in very high-end cars. If you happen to own a Formula One or a Lamborghini, you're driving this every day. For the rest of us, we believe that there's work to do to help this move to, first, serial production of quite high-end cars, and we believe that's really the next step in which we'll be going in -- this market and this industry will be moving to. 
As I mentioned, we need to change the manufacturing processes, and this will take not only a material, but it will take -- links with those who are designing, those who are creating the processes. And the ecosystem that Cytec's been working on with not only the automotive companies but with engineering design houses, even taking equity positions at engineering design houses sets, them up well to succeed in this. 
So we look forward for Solvay and Cytec together to taking the extremely strong position we have in automotive, the relationship throughout the value chain in automotive, the credibility that Solvay has in the automotive industry and bringing in and introducing Cytec's products. So automotive, the market of tomorrow, is an upside in this deal that we will work very hard to make sure we deliver.
The third main market that Jean-Pierre mentioned that we'll talk about is this idea of mining chemicals. When we put this to maybe -- to be more clear on what this is, we have a bit of an addiction today as a world on our smart devices, on our technology which ties us together, and these require mined elements. 
And so the business that Cytec has is it's creating surfactants and materials which allow the separation of the metal from the rest of the waste that you get when you mine. And this is a market that's heavily focused, first, on copper, so they have about 45% of their business in copper; and second, in alumina, 25% of their market is in alumina. 
Both of these elements are extremely needed today. And what we see in the last several years is a demand that is increasing for the chemicals needed to produce these. There are 2 drivers of the demand on chemicals: One is clearly the volume of material that's needed in the world. So as the volumes increase, certainly, that drives a demand for increased chemicals. 
But a second demand, which is actually -- we're seeing as maybe even more important today, is that the quality of the ore slowly deteriorates. And as we mine around the world, we take the nice ore first, and over time, it gets more and more difficult to find good mines. As the quality of the ore deteriorates, this idea of being more effective and more efficient in getting the material out of the mix becomes even more important. 
And so what we're seeing is a demand that is increasing over time for these innovative materials, which allow the efficiency and the effectiveness to increase. And in fact, it allows a mine to stay in life longer, so that rather than needing to create a brand-new greenfield mine, which is extremely important, our customers can continue to push and squeeze out more from existing mines using these materials and this technology. 
It's a business model that we're well aware of. It's a business model in which you have people at the mines, technical service, helping to solve the problems, watching how it works day-to-day. And so it's very much a customer-touching, business-focused, I would call it, service business model that leverages the use of the chemicals that you're making in your sites on-site with the users of the materials. 
So we believe this is a good business for us. We believe it reinforces our Advanced Formulations and our Novecare business quite strongly. And in fact, this mix of Solvay plus Cytec really enhances our leadership globally and, what I would say, natural resource chemicals. And so as we continue to drive natural resources out of the ground, it will become more and more rigorous, more and more environmentally sensitive. And we believe this is a place where we can add value, and mix with Novecare plus what Cytec has is a very strong powerful mix.
So I mentioned a little bit the 3 main markets that we're focused on. Aerospace today, automotive tomorrow and the mining mixed with our energy resources of Novecare. But there's an intangible also as when I look at this deal is that how do these businesses fit together? 
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, we started already 18 months ago when we were discussing the transformation of Solvay of what type of businesses we would want to bring into our portfolio. We screened hundreds of chemical and advanced materials companies from around the world. 
And as we really narrowed this down to just a very small handful, Cytec started to rise above the crowd and for 2 reasons for us: one, it's a very unique opportunity for us to reinforce both of our growth engines. So to make one single acquisition and one single integration to buy a company that reinforces very strongly our Advanced Materials cluster with the aerospace focus with the composites, and yet at the same time has a sister business that perfectly fits inside our Advanced Formulations business. 
So for us, this was a perfect fit to bring in to reinforce both growth engines. And quite honestly, there's little to nothing of Cytec that today we would say we have to get rid of because in fact, it fits very well in our portfolio. And this was a differentiator on this business, both in terms of fit inside the company and in terms of creation of synergies. We believe that this fit allows us to have a stronger lever on synergy potential than many of the other companies we looked at.
From a culture point of view, we've been able to have some significant discussions with Cytec in the past few weeks. What we found is people of a culture that would be very similar to Solvay, a people of a culture who understand the way to do business in taking intimacy with our customers, understanding their needs and replacing metal with very lightweight combinations. We understand that very well. 
And so I think they're going to fit extremely well into our business. As we mentioned on Slide 16, we will take the aerospace composite piece and put it in the Advanced Materials segment, and we will take the in-process separation, added to a technology piece and put it into the formulation segment. So they will be housed in a structure in which they have very similar businesses around them.
What I would say a little bit on the culture as well that's a little bit of the intangible. One of the items that's extremely important in a Cytec-type business is a focus on quality and minimization of waste and making sure that it's right the first time. So we have found in Cytec an extremely strong Six Sigma culture, an extremely strong focus on quality that actually, we believe, will be very good to help stretch us in, I would say, Solvay legacy businesses. 
On the other side, over the last few years, we have been developing an extremely strong focus on manufacturing excellence, on operational excellence or commercial excellence. And we believe the focus of Solvay on excellence, blended with the focus of Cytec on -- from a Six Sigma quality point of view, will be a very strong lever in continuing to drive the performance in this combined business. 
So overall, we see this fitting really hand-in-glove with our business, a perfect strategic fit, really a unique opportunity. We did not find others that brought this, to strengthen our growth engines and to deliver for us a level of performance that exceeds where we have been in the past. So putting all that together, we believe this is a very strong project for us. 
There is one more intangible that really came to us more as we got deeper into this business, understand the -- understood much more about the business in our presentations and discussions with the management, is an idea of a technical know-how and extremely strong complementarity in technology. 
Cytec's aerospace thermoset materials is their bread and butter. They have been working to try to develop new thermoplastics for aerospace. This is a perfect complementarity to Specialty Polymers. And by putting these teams together, we believe that the technology bases we have in these 2 businesses will drive future growth that is not at all in our business plan. 
I mentioned this technology in automotive that we need to change and develop a new process, falls very well with the strong position of Specialty Polymers, we'll drive that together. 
And the mining and phosphine chemicals, we specifically mentioned mining. There are other parts of the Cytec business that are very nice business, very nice value-added, very nice margins, in the use of phosphine chemicals, that leverage very well with Novecare's current existing phosphine-based formulations. So we believe there's technology synergies that will drive new products and innovation and growth in the future that once again is an upside, that is not in our business plan today.
So one of the designs of our strategy in Solvay has been very clear, to focus on sustainability. And why do we want to talk about sustainability? We've made a very strong decision to say that if we are going to be investing, whether that is in CapEx, whether that is in new markets, whether that is in the acquisitions, we want to make sure that those investments are in markets that will be there long term and that have very strong growth drivers long term. Thus, they need to be sustainable. 
So when we find markets that are desperately needed by the planet, that offer solutions that support these changes in regulations to help drive that, we believe that's a very long range, resilient, sustainable market, and we believe we found that with Cytec. And so when we really look at these solutions that Cytec is bringing, it's really responding to the stringent regulatory environment, we believe, that's only going in one direction, the environmental regulations will become more and more stringent. And so this is a key area of us that we believe is a very long-term driver.
So let's talk a moment on synergies. Synergies is a key aspect of this deal, and in fact, we have been working on this, as I mentioned, for 18 months. And the question of what kind of deal can we create where we can be confident and deliver the synergies was key. When we did, looking at Cytec, we've done a really an in-depth analysis. We've worked for months with several consultants who know Cytec extremely well, with industry consultants. 
We've worked with our own experts. We have tested this with banks. We've tested it with others to see -- have great confidence in our ability to deliver these synergies. This is a line-by-line synergy plan. This is not a percent of sales. We've gone into great detail with this. And the main part of this is clearly cost synergies. We've identified over EUR 100 million of annual recurring synergies. This is really on the low side of our range, but this is identified, heavily focused on certainly general administrative, simply delisting a company in the U.S., simplifying their corporate structure. Those are all very big pieces. 
We see certainly advantages in purchasing glass fiber. These are products that we use every day in many of our businesses. We believe that the excellence practices that I mentioned earlier will allow us to drive still significant gains. And if we take simply the experience we've had in Specialty Polymers in the last 3 years, it gives us tremendous confidence to deliver those. 
So cost synergies are, by far, the largest part of what we're talking about here. We have identified line-by-line and we believe that we can realize a substantial part of these by year 3. We do have an implementation cost of about EUR 75 million over the first 2 years to drive this. 
On top of the cost synergies, which is, by far, what we have here in the main part, we do see revenue synergies, as I mentioned, in this complementarity between Specialty Polymers lightweight position in aerospace, moving Cytec faster into automotive and the cross-selling opportunities with Novecare. So all in all, we have a very strong belief we will deliver these synergies. 
Last piece is that Cytec is just finalizing their ERP process, which for the first time will give us the data to really put in place as well our commercial excellence synergies, our more sophisticated pricing mechanisms, and that will be a key driver of growth as well. So overall, we love the deal. We think it's very good and unique."

Let me start by just stating to you that yesterday's share price for Cytec closed at $58.39. Our cash offer of $75.25 equates to a premium of just under 29% based on yesterday's price, 26.9% because of the 3-month a",1000,"Indeed I will. Good morning, everybody. Let me start by just stating to you that yesterday's share price for Cytec closed at $58.39. Our cash offer of $75.25 equates to a premium of just under 29% based on yesterday's price, 26.9% because of the 3-month average. That's the fact. 
Now as you look at that and you see the enterprise value $6.4 billion, it's actually worthwhile take a step back and remembering that companies that have a predictable, sustainable, high sales growth, high earnings growth trajectory typically trade at a much higher multiple than companies that don't. That is a fact. Why? Because we like resilience and growth combined together. This is why the offer that we're putting on the table equates to 14.7x the consensus 2015 EBITDA, excluding synergies, including, as Roger said, our conservative view of the synergies, it's 11.7x.
This is a cash merger that only requires a simple majority vote by Cytec's shareholders. The closing conditions are very standard and customary in here, and we have high confidence this will be achieved.
I'd like to highlight one thing in particular as well, and that is that our reference shareholder, Solvac, that owns 30.2% of our shares, are very supportive of this deal. And for the first time ever, they've confirmed this morning that they will take up their rights in our eventual capital increase.
What's the impact on Solvay going to be? I'd like to remind you, just as Jean-Pierre did, in June, we talked about value. Value, we look at with 3 lenses: earnings growth, cash conversion and returns. I'll take them in turn. 
This deal will improve our REBITDA margin. This transaction will improve our capacity to grow REBITDA. That momentum will be much more sustainable and will really enhance what we have. 
Adjusted EPS will be positive after year 1. It would enhance our free cash flow, and our returns will be accretive though in the medium term, which is very normal, given the significant goodwill that, as you know, we conservatively added into our CFROI calculation. So the blend of high returns, cash conversion and returns absolutely give us the conviction this is a very strong and value-creating deal. And as you're aware, that this deal has obviously been recommended unanimously by Cytec's board as well. 
So how are we going to fund this? Well, first and foremost, we've secured $5.8 billion of bridge financing for 100% of the needs to buy the equity. That bridge financing is available for 2 years. We've also secured contingent hedges to really ensure that we can protect the euro cost essentially, the dollar cost of this acquisition as well through hedges. So again, what we try to do is to make sure that we secure the funding and protected the pricing. Security at low cost has also driven that particular strategy.
On closing, we are looking clearly at a capital structure, and as you can see in front of you, EUR 1.5 billion of equity, EUR 1 billion of hybrid and the balance will come in senior debt, which will be U.S. dollar-denominated. It will be a blend of U.S. native bonds and Eurobonds swapped into dollars. We'll decide and we'll find the precise blend and the tenors nearer the time, given the market conditions. 
Now why do you see that capital structure? Essentially, we have 1 simple goal: absolutely committed to maintaining our investment grade and also to do so knowing that remain efficient and cautious. And that requires us to almost optimize and minimize the equity and maximize the use of debt whilst maintaining that balance between caution and value. 
The dollar debt costs a little more obviously than euro-denominated debt, but it makes a lot of sense because it gives us a natural hedge by blending basically the funding cost with the -- on the other debt, with the cash flows are bound to our U.S. dollar debt as well. 
We fully expect rating agencies to confirm during the course of the next day that we will maintain our investment grade ratings on close. And in fact, we also anticipate some very, very positive comments on how they see this enhancement of this deal on our business profile. 
This is how we're going to pay for it. Fundamentally, the value expect to generate will enable us to maintain a long-standing policy of stable to growing dividends. That is really important to us. Rewarding our shareholders is always been a strong driver for Solvay. 
Now I talked about or we've talked about this has a very strong track record. I'd like to add 1 or 2 facts to those we see on Page 23. Historically, Cytec has grown over the period 2012 to 2015. It has grown its sales by 12.6% compound annual growth rate. Its REBITDA has grown by 18%, 18.4% to be precise. If one looks at the market expectations, the analysts that follow that company, they also predict very strong double-digit earnings growth and I think 9% sales growth looking forward. This is very, very attractive.
What we anticipate on a pro forma basis, clearly, if you consider that history will have a tendency to repeat itself, we expect improvement potential, absolutely our confidence of the margin enhancement with an eventual -- I'm going to come back to an eventual high cash generation. 
I'd like to focus for a moment or 2 on the CapEx. There are times if you look at 2013, there was quite a significant jump in CapEx relative to Cytec. This is a feature of this business, whereby where there are strong contractual demand by customers, particularly in aeronautics, you invest in that. There's a very strong quality and predictability of the earnings that come from these investments. We will absolutely ensure that we can accompany the needs of the customers of Cytec to grow that value. And fundamentally, this will result in a very strong cash conversion. 
With that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

So maybe just a few words before we open to questions. So for us clearly, the key headline is that with this acquisition, we immediately get the $1 billion position as a key supplier of Advanced Materials to the aerospace industry. And for us, this is clearly a major step in a market where we see a lot of potentials with composites but also with our Specialty Polymers businesses. 
We strengthen both of Solvay growth engines. We improve our sustainability offering and our environmental profile. And indeed, this provides very significant earnings momentum, and this creates value for our shareholders. And by the way, just to insist on the fact that our reference shareholder, Solvac, has just announced that they will be supporting the project and that they will participate in the rights issue.
So for us, I think that the combination of Solvay and Cytec creates a platform which will allow us to continue and to accelerate our portfolio reshaping. And indeed in the next couple of years, the group profile will demonstrate that we have the ability to grow significantly, that we have improved our resilience tremendously and that we can indeed generate higher returns.

Moving forward, I'm not saying that it's back to normal in the next few weeks, I'm saying that we are seeing a demand picking up, again very much in line with the expectation we had. On Novecare, we will be more prudent. I think oil prices have continued to be quite volatile. Again, we have a complex situation in North America, where production is holding up quite nicely but soon, there will be a need for companies either to refrac or to drill more oil to continue with this production. We think that we are gaining market share in our supply chain which is transforming itself. We have adjusted our product offering to the fact that customers today are very focused on competitiveness. All of this being said, I will be prudent on regarding any statement on the next quarter. I think it's a -- the situation is probably too complex and too volatile to make a clear statement. Overall, you see that despite this challenge in oil and gas, and I could probably say despite this challenge on Acetow, we are able to produce solid results. And yet, I mean, our outlook for the second half of the year is confident also. On Cytec, and I will let Karim answer on the return on capital. Regarding 2016, I think clearly, our objectives were at constant perimeter, so I don't see that changing. The way we look at the delivery of the current Solvay portfolio for 2016.

I mean, the ones we've presented when we were in Bollate a few weeks ago, the deal with interior of airplanes and there, the development time is much shorter than it is for structural parts of a primary or secondary structure.

On automotive, the situation is a bit different. There too, Cytec, has position in some supercars. The challenge is to move into larger -- into vehicles which are produced at a larger number and there too I think we should get some visibility probably in a couple of years.

What we see today is what's really going to, I would say, slow down, or we need to make sure that the mass adoption is an increase in production process speed to make this online fast so that the solution cost is compatible with the cars. It's much less about recyclability, quite honestly, in this. These products can be recycled by grinding, by putting in as fillers and things, it's not high value-added recycling but it's possible to do. So the limit is changing the production processes."

From Cytec's standpoint, they are very much an aerospace company. They bought Umeco a few years ago, a couple of years ago to enter into the automotive market. And the integration was a little bit difficult, as Roger hinted. Clearly, it's an area where we think we can bring significant support to this type of approach. We are already a very significant player in engineering plastics. In automotive, we have a position in lightweighting materials, thanks to our Specialty Polymer business. So clearly, we organize ourselves to maximize potential with this opportunity [indiscernible] opportunities.

We are signaling that we are confident that for the whole year 2015, we'll show solid growth versus last year. I mean, in a nutshell, we are very much in line with our 2016 objectives. And this leaving the Cytec acquisition on the side. 
So maybe time just to bring this call to a conclusion. Thank you very much for your time. I think, we have -- we are very pleased with the Cytec acquisition. To come up with what I think is a great strategic opportunity for Solvay, it's really a milestone in the transformation of the portfolio of the company but this is not the endgame. We -- I do believe I said it several times in several ways that on the contrary, this is really a trigger for us to continue and to accelerate the portfolio reshaping with really a view to turn, as we will conclude the integration of Cytec, to turn Solvay into indeed a group with a different profile than the one it had a few years ago, much more focused around growth, much more resilient and with significantly higher returns for its shareholders. 
So with that, thank you very much. We'll be in London, Karim, Roger and myself tonight. We'll be in London tomorrow and certainly willing to interact with you. So you can -- if there is an opportunity for you to meet with us, just let Maria and the team know and we'll try to make sure we can find space in our schedule to discuss with you.

Sorry for the change of schedule, but we had a feeling that with all the news we have to share with you today, it was better to organize it as early as possible in the morning. So I'm here wi",2151,"Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for joining this call. Sorry for the change of schedule, but we had a feeling that with all the news we have to share with you today, it was better to organize it as early as possible in the morning. 
So I'm here with Karim Hajjar, our CFO; and Roger Kearns, who is the member of the Executive Committee who is currently supervising the Advanced Materials cluster and who is playing a key role in the Cytec integration project.
So what I suggest is to spend a few minutes to go over the Q2 results, which, by the way, are pretty, in my view, at least, simple and straightforward, and then move into a full presentation of the Cytec project, which, by the way, is for me, a major milestone in the transformation of Solvay. And then we'll open to Q&A.
So quick overview of our results. Very similar -- Q2 very similar to Q1. We were able to post a solid 8% REBITDA increase versus last year, which means EUR 500 million of REBITDA. Sales up 4%; margin, 19%, 66 basis points of improvement, so overall solid. 
When we look at the components, clearly, we've benefited very much from ForEx, EUR 55 million of impact in this quarter, EUR 100 million of positive impact from ForEx for the full half year. Volumes were down, slightly, but down. In fact, if -- when we look across the board, we see 3 different situations, 2 specific issues, businesses where we have significant volume shortfalls, no surprises. Novecare oil and gas segment still at a very low level. Information there is not always simple to put together. We continue to see strong production of tight oil and shale gas in the U.S. but little exploration activities. We see transformation in the supply chain. We think that we are strengthening our positions, but in a market where volumes are minimal.
Acetow, still feeling the impact of the destocking that started last year in China, although a slight improvement at the end of the quarter, which gives us a bit of hope that the situation will improve during the second half of the year. 
We have businesses which are doing very well, mostly the Advanced Materials cluster, where we have strong volume dynamic, which is based on innovation. And then, very strong pricing power across the board, EUR 57 million of impact in Q2, EUR 90 million for the first half, which means that even in markets where we are suffering from low volumes, we are able to defend prices and margins. And this, by the way, has been a feature for Solvay for many years. We put, clearly, price before volume, and I think that this strategy is paying off. 
If you look at our segments, 3 of our 4 segments are showing very solid REBITDA improvement. Advanced Formulations is the only one which is down 12%, mostly linked to the oil and gas situation in Novecare that I was mentioning, unfortunately, not helped by Coatis. The Brazilian situation is -- Brazil is, really, the only region of the world where we see a very challenging macro environment, Aroma being a bit more positive. 
Advanced Materials is really the star segment, if I may say so. 18% REBITDA improvement, another record; 9% volume dynamic and this is fully based on innovation, smart devices, lightweighting of various sorts. Ryton integration is also going well. 
Performance Chemicals, up 9%, which is a very good performance despite the Acetow situation I was referring to. Solid pricing in soda ash and peroxide allowed us to achieve this result, and excellence initiatives are continuing to be the strong performance driver in this cluster. 
And then, Functional Polymers, up 23%. Market fundamentals are improving for our Polyamide business, both on the raw material and energy cost side but also on the market. And on top of this, the excellence initiatives that we have aggressively developed within this cluster are also paying off. 
Significant cash flow generation, EUR 167 million for the quarter. So it shows that we are still very much focused on cash. So overall, solid results for Q2, which allow us to confirm our previous guidance, which called for strong growth of our REBITDA in 2015 versus 2014.
We've made also some progress in the portfolio during the -- during this second quarter. Obviously, the -- we are all expecting the finalization of our PVC Europe deal. INOVYN is -- was indeed created July 1. It's really -- has been a very long, very painful project, but we've stayed very committed to it, and we are very pleased to see that the divestiture of this PVC -- European PVC business is now becoming a reality. You know that we have already an exit, which is very well defined 3 years down the road, and for us, this was really the best possible way to exit from this European PVC business while maximizing the positive impact for various stakeholders. 
But again, talking about portfolio, the key issue today is the presentation of the Cytec project, which, in our view, is an incredibly powerful opportunity to continue our portfolio transformation. I will now -- I suggest that you follow this presentation on the -- using the documents that we've made available. So you've seen the conference details link, which will allow you to follow the -- to follow this presentation. And I will try to refer to the slides I'm using to make it as clear as possible.
So we -- after some careful consideration, we considered that Cytec was indeed a perfect fit with Solvay's strategy, and we will try to explain you why. I will give you another view of the strategic rationale representation. Roger will develop the business case and the very significant opportunities we see on the 2 markets where Cytec will help us become a very significant player. And obviously, Karim will come on the transaction details and the financial impact.
So starting on Slide 5. I mean, since I took over as the CEO of Solvay, I told you that we will be transforming our portfolio quite aggressively. So 2011, the Rhodia acquisition; 2013, Chemlogics; '14, Ryton. We started also some divestiture: Eco Services in '14; INOVYN JV, I just referred to it, in '15. We are still working to finalize the exit of our Latin American PVC business. 
And today, we're seeing that Cytec is, again, a major milestone. Very much aligned, by the way, with what I was telling you in the conclusion of our Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago. I was mentioning that our objective in 2015 was to accelerate the transformation, and I'm very pleased to see that a few weeks after, we are indeed coming to share with you this very important project. 
You've seen on Slide 5 the small metrics that we are using to present our portfolio, with value-creation potential and ability to extract values of our various businesses. Clearly, for us, Cytec is on the upper right-hand corner, and this is the direction in which we are driving Solvay's portfolio. 
And by the way, Cytec is not the final transaction regarding our portfolio. We think that we need to continue portfolio adjustment, portfolio changes, and Cytec is probably a great opportunity for us to continue to look at what can be done to improve the quality of our portfolio. 
The strategic fit for us is excellent. Just by this acquisition, Solvay will become the world #2 largest player in aerospace composite materials. This acquisition strengthens very much our Advanced Materials approach. You've heard us saying that lightweighting is a key driver for the growth of Advanced Materials. We lacked a position in composites. Thanks to Cytec, we are becoming immediately a leader in composites. 
On the Advanced Formulations segment, same impact. Cytec is a global leader in mining chemical business, and we'll explain you later on why we think this mining chemical business is a great business. And thanks to Cytec and the integration of Cytec activities with Novecare, we will strengthen very significantly our position in mining and oil and gas.
Cytec is a company which is very much innovation-driven, very close to customers. Lightweighting but also mining chemicals allow customer to meet more effectively the sustainability challenges, and this is, for us, a very important driver in our strategy, too. 
From a financial standpoint, we will be able to strengthen our earnings momentum. We are very determined to extract pretax synergies of more than EUR 100 million per year, and this acquisition will be adjusted-EPS-accretive after year 1. 
And when we look at the objectives we had in the transformation of Solvay that we have stated several times, I think, we tick all the boxes. Cytec will bring us growth, Cytec will bring us resilience and Cytec will bring us improved returns.
Moving on Slide 7, just to give you a bit more flavor of who Cytec is. Cytec is a $2 billion company, 20% REBITDA margin, 4,600 employees, 29 sites, with a strong focus on composites, which represent 2/3 of Cytec's activities, 1/3 being their position in mining chemical. 
And when we look [ph] at composites, strong position in aerospace. I mean, composites today are a key element in the design of the newest generation of planes, but composites is also an important element in the secondary structure of all currently produced airplanes. And Cytec was able to take a #2 global position in this market. 
Second important market for composites is automotive. Today, it's still a bit of a niche market, focused on very high-end vehicles or niche vehicles, mainly Ferraris, Lamborghinis or a very innovative vehicle like the BMW i3. These are made of composites. But there's really an opportunity to introduce composites in larger-volume vehicle, and this is something on which Cytec has been working, and we do believe that Solvay and Cytec's knowledge about the OEM market will allow us to be an effective partner in the introduction of these new technologies in larger-volume vehicles. 
When it comes to mining chemical, what Cytec does is bring the chemicals which allow it to optimize the extraction of ore from the minerals which are being mined. And this is a very important element in the mining process, something which allows to improve our recovery, something which allows to limit the environmental impact. 
And whatever, I would say, the price of these commodities are, Cytec business is very much linked to volumes of production, and we are very confident, if we look at copper, if you look at -- if we look at alumina, that indeed, the needs are growing. And Cytec's position in this business will benefit from this. 
And by the way, this is a very service-oriented business. Cytec people are on the mine sites working hands on hands with the engineers who are working on ore extraction and treatment, and this is a business model which is very close to what we do in other -- or similar segments within Novecare.
So moving to Slide 8. Just to give you a bit more color, I told you, 2/3 of Cytec business in composites, aerospace materials representing EUR 1 billion of sales, so 50% of Cytec sales. Cytec is selling to all the big names in commercial aircraft. So with stronger focus on Boeing, but a presence with Airbus and the players in regional and smaller Jets. Cytec has made an entry into engines with Safran LEAP engine, and Cytec has also a presence in military aircraft and helicopters. 
Industrial materials, using Cytec terminology, this is really the automotive market with a position in supercars plus a few other smaller segments. And there, clearly, the challenge is to participate in the development of composites as a new technology being used to develop lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicle. 
In-process separation, this is the name of the mining chemical business, as I was describing, strong focus on copper and alumina, with technologies which allow us to optimize the output of ore. And again, a very close link with customers, which create very significant barrier of entries.
So moving to how Solvay will look post-Cytec transaction. You see that, in terms of exposure to different markets, we will significantly increase our exposure to automotive and aerospace, and this is something which is important, because we consider that these 2 markets offer very interesting opportunities. 
And in terms of geography, we will refocus a bit more in North America, which, post-transaction, will represent 26% of our sales, which means that Solvay will become, indeed, an even more global chemical company than we were before. 
So these were really the headlines in terms of strategy, and I would like now to turn to Roger so that he can lead us through the market opportunities and the business case."

Yes, I'm going to try to take the overview that Jean-Pierre just gave and go into a bit more detail in the key markets they serve, give you a little bit more color on where they sit today, and we'll make a comment on where th",3715,"Okay. Good morning, everyone. Yes, I'm going to try to take the overview that Jean-Pierre just gave and go into a bit more detail in the key markets they serve, give you a little bit more color on where they sit today, and we'll make a comment on where the Solvay-plus-Cytec mix leads us into these positions. 
So if we look over on Slide 11, we start with an attractive opportunity in composites. And just in general, what are we talking about when we talk about composites? This is a very lightweight yet very strong material. And so this is actually something fundamentally tied to what we do already in specialty polymers. The idea of replacing metal with a very high-technology plastics is something we do every day in Specialty Polymers, and this composites piece fits very, very well in that mindset and in that way of working. 
So we believe that this is a trend that's going to continue for quite a long time in this continual push to replace metals with lighter-weight materials. 
When we look at this market, we see, really, double-digit growth rates in 2 key areas, and that is in aerospace and in automotive, which happens to be the 2 areas that Cytec is focused on. Still good growth in things like wind power, and that is a market they serve, but we're going to focus today -- on aerospace today and automotive as the market of tomorrow.
So if we take a little bit of a deep dive into aerospace for a minute, I'll move over to Page 12. What you'll see here is, on this drawing, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, the parts in blue are what are called secondary structures. Those are parts that have been on planes and yet growing on planes for many, many years. 
As we look at the new developments that are coming on, new projects like the A350 from Airbus or the 787 from Boeing, we are starting to move from airplanes with 5% to 10% composite structure up to the new designs, which now have 50%-plus composites in the structure. So this is an absolute step-change in the way in which planes are built and the materials that are used inside these planes. And so this is one of the key drivers that we see in the growth of aerospace for the coming years, even decades, is this move to airplanes with a significantly higher percentage of composites in their construction.
The other thing we see here a little bit on this slide is that Cytec today has a clear #2 position in this market. They have been extremely strong in secondary structures for many, many years, and they are now moving to become a real player in the primary structures. Today, they have a position already in military aircraft, in commercial aircraft, in primary structures. They'd mentioned before in their press releases, they believe they are very well situated to get a primary structure position on the Boeing 777X that continues to move them into a new area with future growth potential.
Two drivers of growth in aerospace: one is the -- more composites per plane, but the second piece that we need -- let's go back. The second piece that we need, clearly, is that there is a huge backlog of orders today in aerospace. There is a nearly 8-year backlog at current production rates from simply the Boeing and Airbus of the world. Their focus today is on trying to determine how can they make more planes per year, because if you look at the production rate that is planned today all the way out to 2020, they would be able to deliver less than half of the planes in the backlog today. 
So this is a key need of this market, which is to determine how to make planes faster. And this mix of needing more planes, making them faster and more composites per plane leads us to believe very strongly in this double-digit growth in the aerospace market. 
Cytec is very well placed with all the major customers in aerospace. And we believe this is actually a very strong point that will help us. When I mentioned here a little bit, what does Solvay plus Cytec bring? This is going to be very helpful for developing our sales in Specialty Polymers. 
We have introduced and we showed a little bit at the Capital Markets Day several new products aimed at aerospace using thermoplastic composites, using foams. We believe having the credibility, the client intimacy, the ability to sit down with the designers and decision-makers in these large aerospace customers to show them not only what we can do from a thermoset point of view at Cytec, but also a thermoplastic point of Solvay, is going to be a very strong position and a very key component of becoming more of a driver and more of a partner with the development. So overall, we see double-digit growth in automotive lasting a very long time. 
If you look at a little bit the barriers to entry, this is a market where it takes significant work to get specified. But once you're specified, normally, you are in there for the life of the platform. And when we talk about life of a platform, just as an example, the Boeing 737 was launched in 1967. And I mean, the single-aisle planes are still the bread and butter of Boeing and Airbus. So we see these as very long life, very resilient types of markets. 
We did quite a bit of study and looking over the last 20 years of what's gone on in this industry. And if I take back even to a period in the crisis of 2009, what you see is the backlog slows down or drops, but the production rate, in fact, continue on, because the amount of need is -- far exceeds the ability to supply. 
So all that to say we believe that the aerospace business is very attractive, very resilient, and this will help us develop -- not only continue the Cytec strength but develop also our Specialty Polymers strength. 
So if I take aerospace as the -- really, the markets of today, I'll shift gears a little bit, and let's talk about automotive as what we see as the markets of tomorrow. We are really excited to look at what Cytec has been doing to prepare an ecosystem, I would say, to be able to serve this automotive market. 
And currently, today, automotive is a key part of the Solvay portfolio, especially in Specialty Polymers and Engineering Plastics, where we work every day developing solutions in automobiles to make them lighter, more fuel-efficient. 
This market is being driven by, I would say, basically, by planetary need. Our need to move the world's population around but to have less impact from CO2, and it's certainly supported by regulations. The United States CAFE standards that have been put in place that mandate much more fuel-efficient cars, if you want to sell cars in the United States, is a major driver for this. 
In the European Union, we see continued push for further CO2 emission reductions by 2020. Just to give you an example, in 2002, the regulations were at 260 grams of CO2 per kilometer. They're moving to 90 grams CO2 per kilometer. So we really are cutting by almost -- to 1/3 the level of where we can be on emission regulations. These regulations are driving the automotive manufacturers to look for solutions to make the cars still strong but very light, and that's where this mix of composites comes in to be a real solution provider for that automotive industry.
And it's this mix of very lightweight materials, yet maintaining very good strength, which makes this product, I would say, technically capable of becoming used in larger cars, larger serial cars. What we need to do today is to really work on the manufacturing processes to make these products available at higher speeds, at higher outputs and reduce that system cost. That is a need of the industry, and there are many people working on it, but we really believe that the mix of Cytec plus Solvay puts us in a very good position to be a partner of choice for that. 
We show on the graph a little bit the growth rates. So 50% compounded growth a year from '10 to '20. Clearly, that's starting from a small base. But what we can say so far is from '10 to '15, we're seeing this. So this is real. We're seeing this kind of growth. And we believe we're really coming up to a tipping point, and a tipping point by which this growth would be much, much larger in the future. 
So we see automotive as a -- is a key market for the future. I would say, today, we don't have a tremendous amount of this in the business plan. This is really an upside position for us. But we believe the world's going there, and this puts us in a very good position to be credible and bring solutions.
So on Slide 14, you'll see a little bit what Jean-Pierre mentioned. These materials are used today in very high-end cars. If you happen to own a Formula One or a Lamborghini, you're driving this every day. For the rest of us, we believe that there's work to do to help this move to, first, serial production of quite high-end cars, and we believe that's really the next step in which we'll be going in -- this market and this industry will be moving to. 
As I mentioned, we need to change the manufacturing processes, and this will take not only a material, but it will take -- links with those who are designing, those who are creating the processes. And the ecosystem that Cytec's been working on with not only the automotive companies but with engineering design houses, even taking equity positions at engineering design houses, sets them up well to succeed in this. 
So we look forward from Solvay and Cytec together to taking the extremely strong position we have in automotive, the relationship throughout the value chain in automotive, the credibility that Solvay has in the automotive industry and bringing in and introducing Cytec's products. So automotive, the market of tomorrow, is an upside in this deal that we will work very hard to make sure we deliver.
The third main market that Jean-Pierre mentioned that we'll talk about is this idea of mining chemicals. When we put this to maybe -- to be more clear on what this is, we have a bit of an addiction today as a world on our smart devices, on our technology which ties us together, and these require mined elements. 
And so the business that Cytec has is it's creating surfactants and materials which allow the separation of the metal from the rest of the waste that you get when you mine. And this is a market that's heavily focused, first, on copper, so they have about 45% of their business in copper; and second, in alumina, 25% of their market is in alumina. 
Both of these elements are extremely needed today. And what we see in the last several years is a demand that is increasing for the chemicals needed to produce these. There are 2 drivers of the demand on chemicals: One is clearly the volume of material that's needed in the world. So as the volumes increase, certainly, that drives a demand for increased chemicals. 
But a second demand, which is actually -- we're seeing as maybe even more important today, is as the quality of the ore slowly deteriorates, and as we mine around the world, we take the nice ore first, and over time, it gets more and more difficult to find good mines. As the quality of the ore deteriorates, this idea of being more effective and more efficient in getting the material out of the mix becomes even more important. 
And so what we're seeing is a demand that is increasing over time for these innovative materials, which allow the efficiency and the effectiveness to increase. And in fact, it allows a mine to stay in life longer, so that rather than needing to create a brand-new greenfield mine, which is extremely important, our customers can continue to push and squeeze out more from existing mines using these materials and this technology. 
It's a business model that we're well aware of. It's a business model in which you have people at the mines, technical service, helping to solve the problems, watching how it works day-to-day. And so it's very much a customer-touching, business-focused, I would call it a service business model that leverages the use of the chemicals that you're making in your sites on-site with the users of the materials. 
So we believe this is a good business for us. We believe it reinforces our Advanced Formulations and our Novecare business quite strongly. And in fact, this mix of Solvay plus Cytec really enhances our leadership globally and, what I would say, natural resource chemicals. And so as we continue to drive natural resources out of the ground, it will become more and more rigorous, more and more environmentally sensitive. And we believe this is a place where we can add value, and mix with Novecare plus what Cytec has is a very strong powerful mix.
So I mentioned a little bit the 3 main markets that we're focused on. Aerospace today, automotive tomorrow and the mining mixed with our energy resources of Novecare. But there's an intangible also as when I look at this deal is that how do these businesses fit together? 
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, we started already 18 months ago when we were discussing the transformation of Solvay of what type of businesses we would want to bring into our portfolio. We screened hundreds of chemical and advanced materials companies from around the world. 
And as we really narrowed this down to just a very small handful, Cytec started to rise above the crowd and for 2 reasons for us: one, it's a very unique opportunity for us to reinforce both of our growth engines. So to make in one single acquisition and one single integration to buy a company that reinforces very strongly our Advanced Materials cluster with the aerospace focus with the composites, and yet at the same time has a sister business that perfectly fits inside our Advanced Formulations business. 
So for us, this was a perfect fit to bring in to reinforce both growth engines. And quite honestly, there's little to nothing of Cytec that today we would say we have to get rid of because in fact, it fits very well in our portfolio. And this was a differentiator on this business, both in terms of fit inside the company and in terms of creation of synergies. We believe that this fit allows us to have a stronger lever on synergy potential than many of the other companies we looked at.
From a culture point of view, we've been able to have some significant discussions with Cytec in the past few weeks. What we found is people of a culture that would be very similar to Solvay, a people of a culture who understand the way to do business in taking intimacy with our customers, understanding their needs and replacing metal with very lightweight combinations. We understand that very well. 
And so I think they're going to fit extremely well into our business. As we mentioned on Slide 16, we will take the aerospace composite piece and put in the Advanced Materials segment, and we will take the in-process separation, as a technology piece and put it into the formulation segment. So they will be housed in a structure in which they have very similar businesses around them.
What I would say a little bit on the culture as well that's a little bit of the intangible. One of the items that's extremely important in a Cytec-type business is a focus on quality and minimization of waste and making sure that it's right the first time. So we have found in Cytec an extremely strong Six Sigma culture, an extremely strong focus on quality that actually, we believe, will be very good to help stretch us in, I would say, Solvay legacy businesses. 
On the other side, over the last few years, we have been developing an extremely strong focus on manufacturing excellence, on operational excellence or commercial excellence. And we believe the focus of Solvay on excellence, blended with the focus of Cytec on -- from a Six Sigma quality point of view, will be a very strong lever in continuing to drive the performance in this combined business. 
So overall, we see this fitting really hand-in-glove with our business, a perfect strategic fit, really a unique opportunity. We did not find others that brought this, to strengthen our growth engines and to deliver for us a level of performance that exceeds where we have been in the past. So putting all that together, we believe this is a very strong project for us. 
There is one more intangible that really came to us more as we got deeper into this business, understand the -- understood much more about the business in our presentations and discussions with the management, is an idea of a technical know-how and extremely strong complementarity in technology. 
Cytec's aerospace thermoset materials is their bread and butter. They have been working to try to develop new thermoplastics for aerospace. This is a perfect complementary to Specialty Polymers. And by putting these teams together, we believe that the technology basis we have in these 2 businesses will drive future growth that is not at all in our business plan. 
I mentioned this technology in automotive that we need to change and develop a new process, falls very well with the strong position of Specialty Polymers, we'll drive that together. 
And the mining and phosphine chemicals, we specifically mentioned mining. There are other parts of the Cytec business that are very nice business, very nice value-added, very nice margins, in the use of phosphine chemicals, that leverage very well with Novecare's current existing phosphine-based formulations. So we believe there's technology synergies that will drive new products and innovation and growth in the future that once again is an upside, that is not in our business plan today.
So one of the designs of our strategy in Solvay has been very clear, to focus on sustainability. And why do we want to talk about sustainability? We've made a very strong decision to say that if we are going to be investing, whether that is in CapEx, whether that is in new markets, whether that is in the acquisitions, we want to make sure that those investments are in markets that will be there long term and that have very strong growth drivers long term. Thus, they need to be sustainable. 
So when we find markets that are desperately needed by the planet, that offer solutions that support these changes in regulations to help drive that, we believe that's a very long range, resilient, sustainable market, and we believe we found that with Cytec. And so when we really look at these solutions that Cytec is bringing, it's really responding to the stringent regulatory environment, we believe, that's only going in one direction, the environmental regulations will become more and more stringent. And so this is a key area of us that we believe is a very long-term driver.
So let's talk a moment on synergies. Synergies is a key aspect of this deal, and in fact, we have been working on this, as I mentioned, for 18 months. And the question of what kind of deal can we create where we can be confident and deliver the synergies was key. When we did, looking at Cytec, we've done a really an in-depth analysis. We've worked for months with several consultants who know Cytec extremely well, with industry consultants. 
We've worked with our own experts. We have tested this with banks. We've tested it with others to see -- have great confidence in our ability to deliver these synergies. This is a line-by-line synergy plan. This is not a percent of sales. We've gone into great detail with this. And the main part of this is clearly cost synergies. We've identified over EUR 100 million of annual recurring synergies. This is really on the low side of our range, but this is identified, heavily focused on certainly general administrative, simply delisting a company in the U.S., simplifying their corporate structure. Those are all very big pieces. 
We see certainly advantages in purchasing glass fiber. These are products that we use every day in many of our businesses. We believe that the excellence practices that I mentioned earlier will allow us to drive still significant gains. And if we take simply the experience we've had in Specialty Polymers in the last 3 years, it gives us tremendous confidence to deliver those. 
So cost synergies are, by far, the largest part of what we're talking about here. We have identified line-by-line and we believe that we can realize a substantial part of these by year 3. We do have an implementation cost of about EUR 75 million over the first 2 years to drive this. 
On top of the cost synergies, which is, by far, what we have here in the main part, we do see revenue synergies, as I mentioned, in this complementarity between Specialty Polymers lightweight position in aerospace, moving Cytec faster into automotive and the cross-selling opportunities with Novecare. So all in all, we have a very strong belief we will deliver these synergies. 
Last piece is that Cytec is just finalizing their ERP process, which for the first time will give us the data to really put in place as well our commercial excellence synergies, our more sophisticated pricing mechanisms, and that will be a key driver of growth as well. So overall, we love the deal. We think it's very good and unique."

Let me start by just stating to you that yesterday's share price for Cytec closed at $58.39. Our cash offer of $75.25 equates to a premium of just under 29% based on yesterday's price, 26.9% because of the 3-month a",998,"Indeed I will. Good morning, everybody. Let me start by just stating to you that yesterday's share price for Cytec closed at $58.39. Our cash offer of $75.25 equates to a premium of just under 29% based on yesterday's price, 26.9% because of the 3-month average. That's the fact. 
Now as you look at that and you see the enterprise value $6.4 billion, it's actually worthwhile take a step back and remembering that companies that have a predictable, sustainable, high sales growth, high earnings growth trajectory typically trade at a much higher multiple than companies that don't. That is a fact. Why? Because we like resilience and growth combined together. This is why the offer that we're putting on the table equates to 14.7x the consensus 2015 EBITDA, excluding synergies, including, as Roger said, our conservative view of the synergies, it's 11.7x.
This is a cash merger that only requires a simple majority vote by Cytec's shareholders. The closing conditions are very standard and customary in here, and we have high confidence this will be achieved.
I'd like to highlight one thing in particular as well, and that is that our reference shareholder, Solvac, that owns 30.2% of our shares, are very supportive of this deal. And for the first time ever, they've confirmed this morning that they will take up their rights in our eventual capital increase.
What's the impact on Solvay going to be? I'd like to remind you, just as Jean-Pierre did, in June, we talked about value. Value, we look at through 3 lenses: earnings growth, cash conversion and returns. I'll take them in turn. 
This deal will improve our REBITDA margin. This transaction will improve our capacity to grow REBITDA. That momentum will be much more sustainable and will really enhance what we have. 
Adjusted EPS will be positive after year 1. It would enhance our free cash flow, and our returns will be accretive though in the medium term, which is very normal, given the significant goodwill that, as you know, we conservatively added into our CFROI calculation. So the blend of high returns, cash conversion and returns absolutely give us the conviction this is a very strongly value-creating deal. And as you're aware, that this deal has obviously been recommended unanimously by Cytec's board as well. 
So how are we going to fund this? Well, first and foremost, we've secured $5.8 billion of bridge financing for 100% of the needs to buy the equity. That bridge financing is available for 2 years. We've also secured contingent hedges to really ensure that we can protect the euro cost essentially, the dollar cost of this acquisition as well through hedges. So again, what we try to do is to make sure that we secured the funding and protected the pricing. Security at low cost has also driven that particular strategy.
On closing, we are looking clearly at a capital structure, and as you can see in front of you, EUR 1.5 billion of equity, EUR 1 billion of hybrid and the balance will come in senior debt, which will be U.S. dollar-denominated. It will be a blend of U.S. native bonds and Eurobonds swapped into dollars. We'll decide and we'll find the precise blend and the tenors nearer the time, given the market conditions. 
Now why do you see that capital structure? Essentially, we have 1 simple goal: absolutely committed to maintaining our investment grade and also to do so knowing that remain efficient and cautious. And that requires us to almost optimize and minimize the equity and maximize the use of debt whilst maintaining that balance between caution and value. 
The dollar debt costs a little more obviously than euro-denominated debt, but it makes a lot of sense because it gives us a natural hedge by blending basically the funding cost with the -- on the debt, with the cash flows are bound to our U.S. dollar debt as well. 
We fully expect rating agencies to confirm during the course of the next day that we will maintain our investment grade ratings on close. And in fact, we also anticipate some very, very positive comments on how they see this enhancement of this deal on our business profile. 
This is how we're going to pay for it. Fundamentally, the value expect to generate will enable us to maintain a long-standing policy of stable to growing dividends. That is really important to us. Rewarding our shareholders is always been a strong driver for Solvay. 
Now I talked about or we've talked about this has a very strong track record. I'd like to add 1 or 2 facts to those we see on Page 23. Historically, Cytec has grown over the period 2012 to 2015. It has grown its sales by 12.6% compound annual growth rate. Its REBITDA has grown by 18%, 18.4% to be precise. If one looks at the market expectations, the analysts that follow that company, they also predict very strong double-digit earnings growth and I think 9% sales growth looking forward. This is very, very attractive.
What we anticipate on a pro forma basis, clearly, if you consider that history will have a tendency to repeat itself, we expect improvement potential, absolutely our confidence of the margin enhancement with an eventual -- I'm going to come back to an eventual high cash generation. 
I'd like to focus for a moment or 2 on the CapEx. There are times if you look at 2013, there was quite a significant jump in CapEx relative to Cytec. This is a feature of this business, whereby where there are strong contractual demand by customers, particularly in aeronautics, you invest in that. There's a very strong quality and predictability of the earnings that come from these investments. We will absolutely ensure that we can accompany the needs of the customers of Cytec to grow that value. And fundamentally, this will result in a very strong cash conversion. 
With that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

So maybe just a few words before we open to questions. So for us clearly, the key headline is that with this acquisition, we immediately get the $1 billion position as a key supplier of Advanced Materials to the aerospace industry.

We strengthen both of Solvay growth engines. We improve our sustainability offering and our environmental profile. And indeed, this provides very significant earnings momentum, and this creates value for our shareholders. And by the way, just to insist on the fact that our reference shareholder, Solvac, has just announced that they will be supporting the project and that they will participate in the rights issue.
So for us, I think that the combination of Solvay and Cytec creates a platform which will allow us to continue and to accelerate our portfolio reshaping. And indeed in the next couple of years, the group profile will demonstrate that we have the ability to grow significantly, that we have improved our resilience tremendously and that we can indeed generate higher returns.

Moving forward, I'm not saying that it's back to normal in the next few weeks, I'm saying that we are seeing a demand picking up, again very much in line with the expectation we had. On Novecare, we will be more prudent. I think oil prices have continued to be quite volatile. Again, we have a complex situation in North America, where production is holding up quite nicely but soon, there will be a need for companies either to refrac or to drill more oil to continue with this production. We think that we are gaining market share in our supply chain which is transforming itself. We have adjusted our product offering to the fact that customers today are very focused on competitiveness. All of this being said, I will be prudent on regarding any statement on the next quarter. I think it's a -- the situation is probably too complex and too volatile to make a clear statement. Overall, you see that despite this challenge in oil and gas, and I could probably say despite this challenge on Acetow, we are able to produce solid results. And yet, I mean, our outlook for the second half of the year is confident also. On Cytec, and I will let Karim answer on the return on capital.

Firstly, auto and aero are end uses where it's very well known that they have very long development time periods. So I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on when you'd expect to see really a meaningful change in revenues from, let's say, Solvay legacy projects into those applications now that you're working with Cytec. Secondly, just looking back at Cytec's financials over the last decade or so. You see a lot of volatility here, you see a lot of volatility in EBIT, you see a lot of volatility in cash generation as well. Just -- could you guys talk us through kind of the comfort you get or how do you see that fitting in such that you can perhaps mitigate that volatility and the performance going forward looks more like you desire and less like Cytec's delivered historically."

What we have in aerospace is the situation whereas Cytec has already right composition on a number of programs. So they have visibility is very good. And they are in the process of developing a position in new programs. So these are the upsides, and in some cases, it's upsides which are very well advanced. In other cases, it will take some time for this project to materialize. When I look at our own project in aerospace. I mean, the ones we've presented when we were in Bollate a few weeks ago, the deal with interior of airplanes and there, the development time is much shorter than it is for structural parts of a primary or secondary structure. So yes, I see potential for some upside, I would say starting in a couple of years. So it's not something which we'll -- for which we'll need to wait for 10 years to have an entry. On automotive, the situation is a bit different. There too, Cytec, has position in some supercars. The challenge is to move into larger -- into vehicles which are produced at a larger number and there too I think we should get some visibility probably in a couple of years. And then it might take another couple of years for this to develop into very large volume application. So it's not very long term but it's not immediate. On the second question..."

Cytec made a pretty significant change in their portfolio 2011, 2012, selling a large coatings business that was much more commodity-based, buying the Umeco business that quite honestly, they're still in the process of integrating. So what we see is the -- we believe less volatility certainly in the earnings going forward, much more predictable because of that portfolio change. The second piece on cash, there are projects here in which there are sometime significant CapEx. They've recently installed their large carbon fiber line, which won't really become qualified until early '17. But those kind of projects, they only start after they have a signed commercial contract that last for years, if not generations. So it is an aspect of the business that once they launch something, there can be a CapEx, but it has a very long payback. So we expect that to be -- quite honestly, the CapEx they've put in place already, we would expect this cash generation to improve and we certainly say by '17."

And what kind of share do you think Cytec can grab? That's the first question on the math. And the second question on the feasibility. Isn't the bottleneck really this recyclability or the non-recyclability of the material? Isn't that what's going to hinder the market expansion? And the third question is a bit more generic.

The first slide is from external consultants looking at this industry. They're all pushing in this same direction. What we see today is what's really going to, I would say, slow down, or we need to make sure that the mass adoption comes as an increase in production process speed to make this online fast so that the solution cost is compatible with the cars.

From Cytec's standpoint, they are very much an aerospace company. They bought Umeco a few years ago, a couple of years ago to enter into the automotive market.

As far as the polyacrylonitrile, yes, there's different steps in the process, obviously, for making carbon fiber and different players go further upstream, so if you look at a polyacrylonitrile fiber, you'll have certainly a Toray, a DowAksa JV, or maybe in Femosa.

So maybe time just to bring this call to a conclusion. Thank you very much for your time. I think, we have -- we are very pleased with the Cytec acquisition. To come up with what I think is a great strategic opportunity for Solvay, it's really a milestone in the transformation of the portfolio of the company but this is not the endgame. We -- I do believe I said it several times in several ways that on the contrary, this is really a trigger for us to continue and to accelerate the portfolio reshaping with really a view to turn, as we will conclude the integration of Cytec, to turn Solvay into indeed a group with a different profile than the one it had a few years ago, much more focused around growth, much more resilient and with significantly higher returns for its shareholders. 
So with that, thank you very much. We'll be in London, Karim, Roger and myself tonight. We'll be in London tomorrow and certainly willing to interact with you.

I'm here also with Karim and Maria, and we try to cover as usually pretty quickly to leave enough space for the Q&A part, the main feature of these results.
Clearly, we've seen that we are presenting to you our strong results today, which demonstrate that the confirmation journey that we have started with Solvay, the company is indeed very first. We've seen that this Q3 results show some strong evidence of the our ability to deliver good organic growth in the quarter based on pricing power and excellence initiatives that we have deployed and that will continue deploy for the company. We think also that the portfolio upgrade that we have done contribute to this performance. But clearly, with the Cytec integration, we'll see a significant step change and we see the portfolio will continue to be an important element of the transformation.
When it comes to Q3, the macro context is indeed more challenging than we expected at the beginning of the year. China growth is moderating although we've seen mostly an impact market until now in the automotive market. Brazil is still in a significant -- facing significant economic challenges and low price, which way differently on some of our business over all creating a negative impact on Solvay. This being said, if my memory is correct, this is the sixth quarter in the last 7 quarter where we've delivered double-digit growth, and I think in this environment, this is indeed a good performance, which shows that we have today a portfolio, which allow us to navigate through the various challenges that we see here and there.
If we -- Karim will go into more detail on our numbers but just a few comments. Sales up 5% at EUR 2.7 billion, driven by ForEx. Prices are flat and volume flattish. Prices are up flat but as you know, in an environment where work are going down, which means we've been able to manage our prices quite effectively and indeed our pricing power and first generate REBITDA at EUR 520 million, up 14% than same quarter last year, and if I look at the last 9 months, we have generated EBITDA of 11.5 -- 11.5%. So very much in line with our objective to generate EBITDA growth on the average of 2014, 2016. Margins at 19%, so quite a good number in terms of with our peers.
Looking at the Solvay's of performance, I'd mentioned pricing power the close overall net pricing impact of EUR 58 million positive in Q3 since the beginning of the year EUR 148 million, so really a pricing power very important feature in the way we deliver our results. Especially Performance Chemicals and Functional Polymers in fact, we see even businesses which are currently challenge in terms of volume and market environment, we see us being able to manage very effectively our margins, and this is like to do various excellent initiatives that we have deployed for the group both to improve our cost position but also to manage prices very effectively.
REBITDA was up for example, 9% at Performance Chemical cluster, despite the challenges in the 2 market. We've doubled at Functional Polymer of restoring profitability from what was a low base. Something which is very important for us is innovation, especially visible this quarter, and I should probably say this year, in our Advanced Materials cluster. Volume, up 8%, and it's not just a 1 quarter event. Since the beginning of the year, we've seen an 8% increase in volumes. REBITDA 26%, up versus last year. Margins up 27%. Clearly, our largest segment now recovered breaking REBITDA in the quarter and this is largely due to the ability to bring new, innovative solutions to our customers in market as diverse as smart devices and automotive, and clearly, this segment will continue to play a very significant role in the growth story that Solvay is putting in place.
Excellence initiative, that was mentioned in this when we are talking pricing power or we continued to see a strong contribution from excellence initiatives. In fact, overall, we are expecting contribution in '15, which will be similar to what we've seen last year around, EUR 400 million, which is again very much in line with our objective that we set of generating EUR 800 million by 2016 leading to this excellence initiatives.
In terms of markets. The company is probably well-positioned, I should say well spread between geographies and markets. Geographies, Asia-Pacific today represents 35% of our personnel the year-to-date, and marketing to see a slight increase in our exposure there and again, we continue to see a very significant opportunities in this region despite the worries that some people have expressed regarding China. In China, the most important impact is linked to the automotive industry. The other business that we serve, we think that we continue to see opportunities, which will allow us to continue to develop our positions there.
North America today stable of 23% of our sales and Europe slightly you will see 32% of Solvay sales.
In terms of end market we also saw a situation where we have a very good exposures to quite diverse number of markets, smart devices and auto continue to be. I was mentioning the weakness of the Chinese auto market. This is compensated by the fact that Europe is doing well in terms of position but probably more important, we are continuing to gain market share in the auto segment because their continuing to replace for light weighting application, and this gives us a lot of opportunity in this segment. Healthcare, agro, consumer goods, satisfactory. The significant challenges that we see today are in oil and gas and the cable. Oil and gas, we continue to see a very volatile and difficult to predict market in North America. We've seen the North American accumulation market going down 60% year-on-year, very significant. Prediction market however, is satisfactory. Comments that you would hear from other players. For our sales to in this market is reduced by 30% so very significant, but we are trying to adjust to this situation by a combination of cost reduction, developing innovative solution, which sits with our focus of our customers to improve their competitiveness and cost position. There's a feeling that as soon as the oil price will go up, people will be willing to restart accumulation, that they're willing to do it with the best possible solution best possible and we are working very hard to meet the challenges and are working on our opportunities outside of North America our exposure.
Acetow, we are starting to see some improvements. Destocking is probably over when we look at the Western players. There's probably a bit inventories in the Chinese supply chain but overall the situation becoming more favorable. And just and his comments on our performance, generation EUR 88 million, almost entirely from continues operation. We continue to focus very much on working capital discipline, making sure that we reduced the boat the low-end and the high end in terms of working capital and make sure that throughout the year, we can maintain very satisfactory level of working capital.
2015 is a year of significant CapEx. We knew it. We are currently finalizing a number of project. We have started our fluoropolymer plants in China in the last month. We also commission the largest plant in Thailand. And again, these are just 2 out of 9 projects, which we start in 2015, and this explain the significant amount of CapEx that we've spent both in Q3 EUR 223 million, and if you look at the past 9 months, we have spent EUR 672 million in terms of CapEx.
Portfolio upgrade, I will update you on Cytec. Well clearly, it's a major that we have announced in July. We have excited about this project. By the way, you've seen the Cytec results a few days ago, which confirm that indeed Cytec is doing well in most of its markets and very much in line with the guidance and the expectations that they have shared at the beginning of the year.
The values approval are moving up according to our expectations. We have received already the clearance of the authorities in the U.S. and Mexico. We are progressing very well on the values of the clearance that we need. You've seen that Cytec as culprits meeting in late November. So our expectation to buy year and is still what we expect to do.
We've been working very hard in the past few weeks to get credit for the integration and France we speaking very quick integration. We have already put in place a large integration management office. We have more than 200 people working for our integration. Our expectation is that a clear view of the organization and we'll be moving very quickly to deliver on the synergies, and we will take advantage of the fact that in North America, where most of the synergies will be delivered, we can move much faster than in Europe, and now our intention is indeed to make this integration very quick. We are also working on financing. Bridge loan has been secured we want to make sure that we can refinance it very, very quickly. We will work on very long term debt financing end of November, early December and then we make sure that the other covenant of the financing package could be put in place as quickly as possible. I remind you that some quickly is concerned, very important for us in support of Solvay a reference shareholders. Solvay has announced all direct and they would participate to the rights issue and to the full extent of their current position within Solvay.
Frankly speaking, I've seen the integration we move very quickly. Liquidity of the Cytec team that and as I take management is very supportive of the convection and willing to make sure it the integration moves as quickly especially as possible. Our level of expectation regarding Cytec is probably going to be higher today than it was transaction back in July.
Maybe just a final word on this introduction to say that portfolio improvement don't start with the Cytec. I think in the next couple of years, we've seen fewer significant portfolio project, maybe no to the divestment side than the acquisition. We'll be working very hard to integrate Cytec, and by the way portfolio is also CapEx spending that we have done. The project regarding fluoropolymer in China is a very good a sample of our willingness to strengthen our position in businesses that we consider has been the key important for Solvay. 
Well, sorry, for this a bit of a long introduction, but very are pleased now to turn to Karim to ask him to spend a bit more time with you on some of our numbers, to give you a deep more color on flavor on what we've achieved during this quarter."
377837,315114223,907317,"Solvay SA, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Jean-Pierre, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. What I'd like to do now is to refer to certain slides that our in the results presentation available in our website.And I'll start with Slide #6, which shows unusual the evolution of our net sales a",1640,"Jean-Pierre, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. What I'd like to do now is to refer to certain slides that our in the results presentation available in our website.
And I'll start with Slide #6, which shows unusual the evolution of our net sales and EBITDA quarter-on-quarter. The highlights I'd like to draw your attention to is as follows: one, facts, sales up 5% year-on-year to EUR 2.7 billion. This is entirely attributable foreign exchange as you can see, and really reflect the depreciation of the dollar versus the euro. We're comparing 1.11 in the Q3 of this year to 1.33 in the same quarter last year. You can see that overall volumes remain largely stable, which actually been an improvement over the first year. What's important to note is that most of our activity showed growth. Some such as fluoropolymers are very much positive outliers and that's progress of the compensate for the ongoing reduction in the oil and gas market mentioned, lower volume as well compared to last year.
The short is that we are very encouraged to see some very modest improvements sequentially in volumes in Q3 it compression the first half of this year as well. Pricing, stable overall. REBITDA 100% up 14% and margins have expanded from 18% to 19%. Volume impact is negative 3%, and that really is the mix effect and what's more what's particularly encouraging for us growth is the pricing power that's been alluded to 4 factors I'd like to highlight: one, we retained benefit resulting from lower raw material prices; two, pricing power across all the segments, especially Performance Chemicals more than contributing; three, transactional ForEx positive EUR 25 million net pricing; fourth, excellent programs really have introduced our variable costs make us more efficient in contributing EUR 58 million. It's not the first quarter it really showed the ongoing strength of the pricing of it. Fixed costs, are up mentioned 1 in a moment. What is also worthy to note is the fact that inflation on our fixed costs are being compensated by strong delivery and operational excellence. And also the costs increased you see there are also affect that one off negative of EUR 7 million, which is linked to the impairment covenant issuance rights in Brazil.
In summary, step back a look at his results, I would share with you my view which is really the fact that highlights the quality of diversified portfolio combined with a continued momentum, real strong delivery on the program and has make us progress despite the headwinds oil and gas.
Now let me take you through some of the businesses on Slide 7. Advanced Formulations you won't be surprised and welcome the fact that maintain margins in a stable level at 15%. Now the context of lower prices and volatile prices is not a surprise. The growth did continue. It's not everywhere. So for example, the oil and gas drilling and stimulation it of course fell, not new news. Production subsector demand is holding up quite well. This is some resilience. Good progress is being made in other parts of care and also in other parts of our portfolio. For example, performance strongly compared to last year albeit from a low base because we did have the impacts of production issues last year because this also progressed held by most important for exchange impact.
Advanced Materials, EUR 23 [ph] million 26% in its another consecutive record. Margins expanding to 26%. Now that reflects continued strong demand, mainly Specialty Polymers in auto in certain industry application but of course as well in strong demand and smart devices, and we what published about that all campaign for smart devices can create them for regular pattern quarter-on-quarter look at these in terms of selling in the longer continuum of time and doing a stronger to get progress even in that pace, which is very encouraging. Volumes special up as well. Positive net pricing and ForEx have to move and offset higher fixed costs. Jean-Pierre talked about development in China Specialty Polymers. We also had the opening in Q2 of the greenfield silica plant a lot of that will great value as we invest for future growth. But it does it about the initial term fixed costs.
Performance Chemicals. REBITDA up 9% margins remained flat at 26%. Pricing power is the main contributor and they have to move and offset the quarter does it the group pricing was strong. Margins also improved in emerging markets particularly as ethylene prices dropped in Southeast Asia, helping to grow our margins. The volume impact, you will be surprise is negative look because of the mix effect and that reflects the volume drop that unheard of in acetyl compared to last year.
Functional Polymers more than doubled REBITDA to $44 million and expanded their margins 25.5% [ph] and that again is primarily attributed to net pricing increases in our polymer business particularly where some of the lower -- benefits of lower raw material prices were able to be possibly retained for example in the plastics business.
Finally, in Corporate & Business Services, the net costs was EUR 66 million compared to EUR 50 million in the same quarter last year. Corporate and function costs were EUR 3 million and that really reflects 3 things: Cost reductions, very positive; inflation and foreign exchange. The split side of having a supported intact profit is a negative impact on our fixed costs. So net EUR 300 million will be very positive in this consumptions. Energy services had a negative contribution compared to last year, reflecting both the impairment of EUR 7 million and somewhat weaker markets in energy and carbon markets.
I'll now turn to the elements below the REBITDA line on Slide 13. There are 3 particular I'd like to draw your attention to. Firstly, other elements with EUR 37 million negative and this relate to financial and foreign exchange impacts on moving JV.
And what does that comprise? Essentially, EUR 7 million of the normal financial interest charges on the debt during the JV but more importantly, it's EUR 27 million of foreign exchange related impact in that you ruble and JV, and that ruble effects is 16% [ph] devaluation in the ruble versus the euro. That is what's driven it. Secondly, nonrecurring costs are up EUR 31 million from last year for 1 reason. Essentially, EUR 32 million of non-cash contingent hedging costs relating to the Cytec acquisition. Now what does that really too? It relates to the fact that in announcing the deal to do Cytec, we tried -- we did actually secure the dollar cost of acquisition on the equity that we are issuing in euros. So by going for a deal contingent forward, we pay a premium but we absolutely locked down the euro on the secure economics. This become embedded with the price when they close the deal, but that's just non-cash for now. Finally, the contribution from discontinued operations was negative. In the third quarter, we only have 1 plant and the performance there was reflecting challenging market conditions in Latin America. Remind you that last year, we have the profits that we sold at the end of 2014, and we will also have the result of the business which now of the JV beginning of July 2015.
In short, there's 3 factors all relate to portfolio, and this is really a consequence of the development transformation of the portfolio figure.
Moving on to cash. Page 14. Cash is up, as Jean-Pierre said, it's down EUR 88 million. It's more than 50% higher than last year. Yes, strong working capital discipline. Our ratio of industrial working capital to sales was 15.6% in Q3. That's 0.7% better than last year. Looking ahead, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, we anticipate a smooth working capital profile at year-end compared to last year as well.
CapEx, the amount was up by EUR 70 million compared to the third quarter, was taking out an cumulative basis the first 3 quarters are you today CapEx is EUR 672 million. That's EUR 130 million more than last year. About half of that increase is linked to dollar euro exchange impacts. CapEx levels are totally in line with our expectations, and we also confirm our expectation that looking forward into 2016 and beyond, we do anticipate the reduction in CapEx intensity.
Looking forward on cash. You'll recall that last year at an exceptionally strong Q4 on cash continuing businesses, I remind you there's EUR 542 million of free cash flow in Q4 2014. We also highlighted the fact that, that benefited from exceptional performance, really strong performance in working capital including the recovery of long outstanding receivables.
If I take a step back and share with you our view of the following the underlying basis, taking account of the exceptional factors leaving aside the cash flows from discontinued businesses et cetera. We expect our operating cash flow generation this year to be largely flat again last year as a result of reinvesting higher operating profits into higher CapEx roughly about EUR 100 million more, again, FX is a big factor, and some working capital build to make sure our customers early into the year.
Other highlights on cash are essentially the elements on acquisition and divestments of EUR 8 million, 2 factors. One, we did receive EUR 150 million in cash on the setup of, that became EUR 100 million in cash and once account working capital adjustments, and there are non-cash deconsolidation effect that impacted net debt as well. We also reflect in those figures a payment for the acquisition of the minority interest in Solvin.
Net debt as a result of those moments reduced from EUR 1.6 million to EUR 1.5 million. And with this, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

Maybe just a couple of comments to these stuff of our meeting.
Outlook. First, looking back, we've been able to deliver solid double-digit growth over the past 9 months, 11.5% of REBITDA growth despite significant adjustments in 2 of the markets that we've served. In Q4, we expect to see the usual seasonality, maybe slightly more pronounced than what we've seen in the past year because we're seeing that some of our customers in the current environment we manage handle inventories, which are always important excellence point to a lot of our customers in the we serve, but no breakthrough other than this slightly more important than usual seasonal adjustment, and this leads us to reconfirm my expectation of solid REBITDA growth for full-year 2015.
One last point regarding dividend. We have announced our interim dividend as we usually do. EUR 1.36 per-share. It's 40% of 2014 net so this is just. The application of the usual dividend policy at Solvay. It is payments to generate January 21. Just to be very clear, dividend will be for each of the share the will exist at the time of record update. As you know, we have announced a right issue very important for you to realize that the interim dividend will be paid the full our existing shares at the time of the record date. However, if we do proceed with the right issue to finance the acquisition of Cytec, which is our intention, we will adjust the total dividend payment regarding 2015 to reflect the distribution of right as it is customer for transaction at this time. So no surprises there. The adjustment will take place when we will decide to month of the full dividend and this will be announced with our Q4 results.
So with that, I suggest we moved to the Q&A part of this presentation."

So can you maybe tell us exactly what you mean by lumpiness of the new product launches? Do you think the customers of decided to give you the occurrence of 6-month of sales within 1 quarter and therefore Q4 will be weaker? Or have you had more than just 1 product launch? I'm just struggling with this kind of growth and some of Q3.

This is linked to increased market share and increased penetration that we've been able to achieve in this market, and regarding Q4, there was nothing in my comment, which related to specific situation of this market. We expect, as I've said, seasonality this year because of the fact that some of our customers seems to be a bit more prudent. Environment is a little bit more volatile, but again, nothing, which was specifically linked to this market. And overall, again, in terms of seasonality of this market, there's no -- they are very similar this year versus last year.

It's true that we depend on some macro element like foreign exchange rates for example, but overall, we see with the new capacity that was built in 2015 coming online, with the increased penetration of our product in sub market, with continuation of very challenging oil and gas markets in North America, with a bit of an improvement from the market when Acetow to market.

On satisfactory, sorry, but I think satisfactory mean satisfactory. If you look at the overall numbers available regarding the North America oil and gas market, we see a situation where production continue at the very satisfactorily level. I think we are just starting to see a bit of moderation in terms of production. On the contrary, accumulation have decreased very significantly. So we continue to see a very good level of demand in the production segment and we continue to perform well in this segment. The reality that at some point in time, production will start to decrease. No further effort in the stimulation. And I think we are -- the key question that I don't have better answers and all of my colleagues from the of companies who have made comments on this subject in the past weeks. At this point of time, the operators in the U.S. will not have an important question to answer about their willingness to reinvest in stimulation or not, and I think there will be probably 2 components. One, is the oil price at the time they will make their decision. And the second, is the ability to come up with more competitive solutions, and in this past, we are working very hard. I think we made some progress both in the organization and the supply chain technology, we are making very good to our customers to make sure that they can improve their competitiveness when they will have to reconsider -- they will want to prepare for our future production on their wells. So again, satisfactory means that we have performed very well up until now, but inferior market where we should be prudent before making any comments looking forward. If my memory is correct, I think the CEO of who said a few days ago that he has never seen the market so volatile. So our view is that we need to adjust to this. It will come back I don't have any questions. It will come back. Polyamide, yes, I mean, we have ended up our program we have announced a couple of years ago. At the end of last year but we are continuing our efforts. And the good performance of polyamide is a combination of some of the elements that you've mentioned. We've continued to work on costs both fix and valuable costs. We continue to work on the various optimizations. Business we are swaps for example, time swaps, geographical swaps could help improve our position and indeed the market especially in polyamide is seasonably good as we speak. I mean we see the level of demand, which is fine. We see a level of production, which is a reasonably well in line with demand. We are continuing to make on our downstream plastic market. In the context, gaming space to work. So all the team is focused on improving our profitability and induced indeed he sees visible in our results for the quarter, also visible for the full year.

What we're saying is this year the underlying basis, we expect to be in that zone and essentially, driven by reinvesting high profits after-tax clearly into higher working capital because we will be really, really being ready to tackle the beginning of next year the capacity respond to customers as well as the higher CapEx. That is the nature of the profile we anticipate. On the bridge, couple of things. One is there is commercial confidentiality. I won't give you the specifics. I'll just remind you a couple of things. One, it's a standby facility. Particularly, there are not plan on using it. It's available for 2 years. If we were to grow complete within our rights to do so, it's very low costs in short-term financing, much cheaper in terms of basis points than a senior debt. But that's another point because it's about risk making sure I have prudent robust balance sheet. And as I said, it's a standby facility. There is a step of mechanistic if we were to draw down on a quarterly basis to ensure that we become economically motivated to draw down the finance, the permanent financing, should we need to. But it's really important to have that bridge finance because it doesn't mean we're not compelled to the market if conditions aren't exactly the way they wanted it to be. Okay, it's really good to have that but the intention and is not to do that down."

We are currently doing the product approval. It's an industrywide. It takes a long time to approve new product coming from a new plant but the capacity you see that very, very quickly, and in fact, we are already thinking of the next capacity extension probably in Asia. And in terms of regional trend, I think the only meaningful element is a bit of a slowdown in Asia, which is due to the current situation of the automotive industry in China, but overall, solid performance, any energy efficient are continuing to gain shares in the various regions where they are not already turned down. In Europe, it's almost energy-efficient but North America and Asia, there are significant opportunities and we continue to see nice growth. Our performance are probably meaningful element.

You referred to sort of getting the U.S. antitrust approvals. Can you just update us in terms of where are you or how comfortable are you once you acquire this asset in terms of some of the defense business that Cytec has.

In fact, the slight improvements we've seen on volume are probably more into soda ash and peroxide. I think Karim mentioned flattish, which flattish to slightly positive, and at the end of the day, these are the 2 businesses where we see some volume improvement. Especially the case of peroxide, which has been doing quite well in terms of finding the opportunities for our product and yes, indeed Acetow, we still see the significant impact in terms of volume growth situation is starting to normalize. On the emerging biochemicals, sorry, my eyes signaling me -- nothing chemical is also contributing to the growth of this segment. Cytec, we are very confident of the approval. As I've said, we've got the approval in the U.S. some weeks ago. We are expecting to have the European approval but early in December, and this should conclude as a number of our other countries but we think that Europe is likely to be the last country to receive its approval. We have an approval, which should lead of Cytec business, which is called something. We expect also to in fact also early December that we should have all the regulatory approvals early December. That's why I'm confident that we should be able to close during the month of December. Frankly speaking, no issue with the defense business. If you look at, for example, the launches defense contract Cytec date for, it's a plane that's been sold in various regions, including Europe. And in fact, I probably think that the fact that we become a European owned or European owner of this business probably helps to demonstrate that indeed, the supply chain which is used to produce this equipment indeed a very global supply chain. So we don't see terms to work with Cytec under a different ownership. And on the contrary, clearly, see the airplane side of the business but also on the military. It's a willingness to make sure that the supply chain will support these types of production becoming even more global, and our position will probably help diversify our production facilities around the world.

I think that's probably a couple of project that we need to execute in the next couple of years to continue to improve the quality of our portfolio, and yes, indeed, I think that we continue on the course trajectory in the next years. I mean, we have invested significantly within the new capacity, which are coming online more or less as we speak. This will fuel the growth for 2016. We see Cytec committing also very significant growth opportunities. So overall, I think that Solvay will be in a very good position to continue to generate solid growth not only in Q4 but probably next following years. Transformation has been a very important element in Solvay strategy. Transformation has delivered and is delivering, but transformation will continue in the next few years and there is a strong willingness from the management team of Solvay to make sure that we will become indeed a company with a very, very quality portfolio, very much focused on innovation and having the ability to increase the returns to our shareholder. With that, I thank you very much. I remind you that we have a next shareholder meeting on November 17, which will give direct authorization to proceed with the rights issue in connection with the Cytec acquisition. November 24, Cytec shareholders will vote on the transaction, and we'll see each other in the February 2016. I was looking for the exact date, February 25, I think, for the full year results of Solvay. Thank you very much, and have a very good day."

I'm here in Brussels with Karim and Maria. And we'll try to cover, as usually, pretty quickly to leave enough space for the Q&A part, the main feature of these results.Clear",2028,"Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, to join us for this Q3 results call. I'm here in Brussels with Karim and Maria. And we'll try to cover, as usually, pretty quickly to leave enough space for the Q&A part, the main feature of these results.
Clearly, we've seen that we are presenting to you strong results today, which demonstrate that the transformation journey that we have started with Solvay a couple of years ago is indeed bearing fruits. We think that these Q3 results show some strong evidence of the -- our ability to deliver good organic growth in the quarter based on pricing power underpinned by the various excellence initiatives that we have deployed and that we'll continue to deploy for the company. We think also that the portfolio upgrade that we have done contribute to this performance. But clearly, with Cytec integration, we will see a significant step change, and we think that portfolio will continue to be an important element of the transformation.
When it comes to Q3, the macro context is indeed more challenging than we expected at the beginning of the year. China growth is moderating, although we've seen mostly an impact up until now on the automotive market. Brazil is still in a significant -- is still facing significant economic challenges and low oil price, which weighs differently on some of our business, is overall creating a negative impact on Solvay. This being said, if my memory is correct, this is the sixth quarter in the last 7 quarter where we've delivered double-digit growth. And I think that in this environment, this is indeed a good performance, which show that we have today a portfolio which allow us to navigate through the various challenges that we see here and there.
If we -- Karim will go into more details on the -- on our numbers but just a few comments. Sales up 5% at EUR 2.7 billion, driven by ForEx. Prices are flat and volume flattish. Prices are flat, but as you know, in an environment where raw materials are going down which means that we've been able to manage our prices quite effectively and, indeed, our pricing power, help us generate REBITDA at EUR 520 million, up 14% versus the same quarter of last year. And if I look at the last 9 months, we have generated a growth of REBITDA of 11.5%, so very much in line with our objective to generate 10% REBITDA growth on the average of the -- of 2014,2016. REBITDA margins strengthened at 19%, so quite a good number in comparison with our peers.
Looking at the drivers of performance. I've mentioned pricing power across segments. Overall net pricing impact of EUR 58 million positive in Q3; since the beginning of the year, EUR 148 million. So clearly, pricing power is a very important feature in the way we deliver our results, especially higher [ph]Performance Chemicals and Functional Polymers. But in fact, we see even in some businesses which are currently challenged in terms of volume and market environment, we see us being able to manage very effectively our margins, and this is linked to the various excellent initiatives that we have deployed for the group both to improve our cost position but also to manage prices per se very effectively.
REBITDA was up, for example, 9% at Performance Chemical cluster, despite the challenges in the tow market. We've doubled at Functional Polymer of restoring profitability from what was a low base. Something which is very important for us is innovation, especially visible this quarter, and I should probably say this year, in our Advanced Materials cluster. Volume up 8%, and it's not just a 1-quarter event. I mean, Since the beginning of the year, we've seen an 8% increase in volumes. REBITDA at 26%, up versus last year. Margins up to 27%. Clearly, our largest segment now posts a new record-breaking REBITDA in the quarter. And this is largely due to the ability to bring new, innovative solutions to our customers in market as diverse as smart devices and automotive. And clearly, this segment will continue to play a very significant role in the growth story that Solvay is putting in place.
Excellence initiative, I was mentioning this when we are talking pricing power, but we continue to see a strong contribution from excellence initiatives. In fact, overall, we are expecting a contribution in '15, which will be similar to what we've seen last year, around EUR 300 million, which is once again very much in line with our -- the objective that we've set of generating EUR 800 million by 2016 linked to this excellence initiatives.
In terms of markets, the company is probably well positioned, I should say well spread between geographies and end market. Geographies, Asia Pacific today represents 35% of our sales year-to-date. We are continuing to see a slight increase in our exposure there, and again, we continue to see very significant opportunities in this region despite the worries that some people have expressed regarding China. In China, the most important impact that we have perceived is linked to the automotive industry. In the other business that we serve, we think that the -- we continue to see opportunities, which will allow us to continue to develop our positions there.
North America today is stable at 23% of -- representing 23% of our shares -- of our sales, sorry, and Europe slightly reducing. Europe today represents 32% of Solvay's sales.
In terms of end market, we see also a situation where we have very good exposures to a quite diverse number of markets. Smart devices and auto continue to be strong. I was mentioning the weakness of the Chinese auto market. This is compensated by the fact that Europe is doing well in terms of position, but probably even more important, we are continuing to gain market share in the auto segment because they are continuing to replace metals for light-weighting application, and this gives us a lot of opportunity in this segment. 
Health care, agro, consumer goods, satisfactory. The significant challenges that we see today are in oil and gas and the acetate cable. Oil and gas, we continue to see a very volatile and difficult-to-predict market in North America. We've seen the North American stimulation market going down 60% year-on-year, very significant. Production market, however, is satisfactory, which is very much in line with the comments that you would hear from other industry players. 
For Novecare, our sales to the oil and gas market have reduced by 30%, so very significant. But we are trying to adjust to this situation by a combination of cost reduction, developing innovative solution, which fits with the strong focus of our customers to improve their competitiveness and cost position. There's a feeling that as soon as the oil price will go up, people will be willing to restart stimulation. But they want to do it with the best possible solutions [indiscernible] the most competitive production costs. And we are working very hard to meet these challenges, and we are also working on other opportunities outside of North America to diversify our exposure.
Acetow, we are starting to see some improvements. The destocking is probably over when we look at the Western players. There's probably still a bit of inventories in the Chinese supply chain, but overall, the situation which is becoming more favorable. 
And just to end these comments on our performance, strong free cash flow generation, EUR 188 million, almost entirely from continuous operation. We continue to focus very much on working capital discipline, making sure that we reduce the peaks, both the low end and the high end in terms of working capital and making sure that throughout the year, we can maintain very satisfactory level of working capital.
2015 is a year of significant CapEx. We knew it. We are currently finalizing a number of project. We have started our fluoroelastomer plants in China in the last month. We have also commissioned the largest bicarbonate plant in Thailand. And again, these are just 2 out of 9 project, which we start in 2015. And this explain the significant amount of CapEx that we've spent both in Q3, EUR 223 million. And if you look at the past 9 months, we have spent EUR 672 million in terms of CapEx.
Portfolio upgrade, and I will update you on Cytec. Clearly, it's a major step change that we have announced in July. We have excited about this project. By the way, you've seen the Cytec results published a few days ago, which confirm that indeed Cytec is doing very well in most of its market and very much in line with the guidance and the expectations that we have shared at the beginning of the year.
The various regulatory approval are moving according to our expectations. We've received already the clearance on the antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Mexico. We've -- we are progressing very well on the various other clearance that we need. You've seen that Cytec has called for its shareholder meeting in late November. So our expectation to close this deal by year-end is still what we expect to do.
We've been working very hard in the past few weeks to get ready for the integration, and frankly speaking, it will be a very quick integration. We have already put in place a large integration management office. We have more than 200 people working to prepare for the integration. Our expectation is that on day 1, we will have already a clear view of the key element of the organization. And we'll be moving very quickly to deliver on the synergies, and we will take advantage of the fact that in North America, where most of the synergies will be delivered, we can move much faster than in Europe. And our intention is, indeed, to make this integration very quick and an effective one. 
We are also working on financing. You know that we have a bridge loan, which has been secured, but we want to make sure that we can refinance it very, very quickly. We will work on the long-term debt financing end of November, early December, and then we'll make sure that the other component of the financing package can be put in place as quickly as possible. I remind you that as far as the equity is concerned, it's very important for us to have the support of Solvac, our reference shareholders. Solvac has announced that it will take all their rights and that they would participate to the -- they will participate to the rights issue and to the fullest extent of their current position within Solvay.
Frankly speaking, I've seen the integration will move very quickly. We are impressed by the quality of the Cytec team that we've met. And the Cytec management is very supportive of the transaction and willing to make sure that the integration moves as quickly and as efficiently as possible. And Our level of expectation regarding Cytec is probably even a bit higher today than it was when we announced the transaction back in July.
Maybe just a final word on this introduction to say that portfolio improvement don't stop with Cytec. I think that in the next couple of years, we'll see a few more significant portfolio of project, maybe more on the divestment side than the -- than on the acquisition, as we will be working very hard to integrate Cytec. And by the way, portfolio upgrade is also the result of some of the CapEx spending that we have done. The project regarding fluoropolymer in China is a very good example of our willingness to strengthen our position in businesses that we consider as being the key growth engine for Solvay. 
Well, sorry, for this a bit of a long introduction, but I'm very pleased now to turn to Karim to ask him to spend a bit more time with you on some of our numbers to give you a bit more color and flavor on what we've achieved during this quarter."

What I'd like to do now is to refer to certain slides that are in the results presentation available in our website.And I'll start with Slide #6, which shows as usual the evolution of our net sales",1812,"Jean-Pierre, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. What I'd like to do now is to refer to certain slides that are in the results presentation available in our website.
And I'll start with Slide #6, which shows as usual the evolution of our net sales and REBITDA quarter-on-quarter. The highlights I'd like to draw your attention to are as follows: one, fact, sales up 5% year-on-year to EUR 2.7 billion. This is entirely attributable to foreign exchange as you can see and really reflects the appreciation of the dollar versus the euro. We're comparing $1.11 in Q3 this year to $1.33 in the same quarter last year. You can see that overall volumes remain largely stable, which actually have been improving over the first half of the year. What's important to note is that most of our activity showed growth. Some such as Specialty Polymers are very much positive outliers, and that progress helped to compensate for the ongoing reduction in the oil and gas market, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, clearly lower volumes in Acetow as well compared to last year. In short, [indiscernible] Acetow is that we're very encouraged to see some modest improvement sequentially in volumes in Q3 compared to the first half of this year as well. 
Pricing, stable overall. REBITDA, as Jean-Pierre said, is up 14%, and margins have expanded from 18% to 19%. The volume impact is negative 3%, and that really is a mix effect and no more. What's particularly encouraging for us in terms of quality of the growth is the pricing power that's been alluded to, and there are 4 factors I'd like to highlight: One, we retain some of the benefit resulting from lower raw materials prices. Two, pricing power across all operating segments, especially Performance Chemicals, were there contributing. Three, transactional ForEx positive EUR 25 million, leading up to net pricing. Fourth, and by no means least, excellence programs really helped introduced our variable costs make us more efficient and contributing EUR 58 million. It's not the first quarter it really showed the ongoing strength of the pricing power in Solvay.
Fixed costs are up with new plants, as Jean-Pierre mentioned. One, I'll refer to it in a moment, what is also worthy to note is the fact that inflationary cost pressures on our fixed costs are being compensated by continued strong delivery and operational excellence. And also the cost increased that you see there is also the effect of one-off negative of EUR 7 million, which is linked to the impairment of carbon emission rights in Brazil.
In summary, as I take a step back and look at these results, I would share with you my view, which is really the fact that highlights the quality of a diversified portfolio combined with a continued momentum, real strong delivery on the excellence programs and helps us to make progress despite the headwinds, oil and gas, acetate tow. 
Now let me take you through some of the businesses on Slide 7. Advanced Formulations, you won't be surprised to see a decline of 8%. And also, you will welcome the fact that we maintain margins in a stable level at 15%. Now in the context of low oil prices and volatile prices, it's not a surprise. The volume drop at Novecare did continue. It's not everywhere. So for example, the oil and gas, cementing, drilling and stimulation, yes, of course, fell. That's not new news. Production subsector demand is holding up quite well. There is some resilience. Good progress is being made in other parts of Novecare and also in other parts of our portfolio. For example, Aroma Performance really recovered very strongly compared to last year, albeit from a low base because we did have the impacts of production issues last year. Coatis also progressed, helped by most important [ph] foreign exchange impact.
Advanced Materials, EUR 236 million, 26% improvement. It's another consecutive record. Margins expanding 26% to 27%. Now that reflects continued strong demand, mainly Specialty Polymers, in auto and in certain industrial application but, of course, as well in strong demand in smart devices. And we want to acknowledge the fact that order patterns for certain campaigns with smart devices can create an irregular pattern quarter-on-quarter. So we tend to look at this in terms of its very [ph] longer continuum of time and do note strong continued progress even in that pace, which is very encouraging. 
Volumes in Silica and Special Chem up as well. Positive net pricing and ForEx helped to more than offset higher fixed costs. Jean-Pierre talked about the new fluoroelastomer plant that we opened in China with Specialty Polymers. We also had the opening in Q2 of the greenfield Silica plant in Poland. All of that will create value as we're investing for future growth. But it does impact, in the short term, fixed costs.
Performance Chemicals, REBITDA up 9%, margins remained flat at 26%. Pricing power is the main contributor, and it helped to more than offset the volume drop in Acetow. Pricing of soda ash and peroxides was strong. Margins also improved in Emerging Biochemicals, particularly as ethylene prices dropped in Southeast Asia, helping to improve our margins. The volume impact, you won't be surprised, was negative and that's largely because of the mix effect. And that reflects the volume drop that, I hope you won't be surprised, is unheard of in Acetow compared to last year.
Functional Polymers more than doubled their REBITDA to EUR 44 million and expanded their margins from 5% to 12%. And that, again, is primarily attributed to net pricing increases in our Polyamide business, particularly where some of the lower -- some of the benefits of lower raw material prices were able to be possibly retained, for example, in the Engineering Plastics business.
Finally, in Corporate & Business Services, net costs were EUR 66 million compared to EUR 50 million in the same quarter last year. Corporate and function costs were EUR 3 million up, and that really reflects 3 things: cost reductions, very positive; inflation and foreign exchange. The flip side of having a supportive impact of foreign exchange in our profit is a negative impact in our fixed costs. So net EUR 3 million, we view, is very positive in these circumstances. Energy Services had a negative contribution compared to last year, reflecting both the impairment that I referred to of EUR 7 million and somewhat weaker markets in energy and carbon markets.
I'll now turn to the elements below the REBITDA line on Slide 13. There are 3 particular matters I'd like to draw your attention to. Firstly, other elements were EUR 37 million negative, and these relate to financial and foreign exchange impacts on the RusVinyl JV. Now what does that comprise? Essentially talking of EUR 7 million of normal financial interest charges on the debt in the JV but, more importantly, a EUR 27 million foreign exchange-related impact in the euro debt in that Russian ruble JV, and that really reflects a 15% devaluation in the ruble versus the euro. That is what has driven it. 
Secondly, nonrecurring costs are up EUR 31 million against last year for one reason: essentially, EUR 32 million of noncash contingent hedging costs in relation to the Cytec acquisition. Now what does that relate to? It relates to the fact that in announcing the deal to do Cytec, we tried and we did actually secure the dollar cost of acquisition on the equity that we are issuing in euros. So by going for a deal contingent forward, we pay a premium, but we absolutely locked down the euro cost to secure economics. This becomes embedded with the price when we close the deal, but that's just noncash for now. 
Finally, the contribution from discontinued operations was negative. In the third quarter, we only have Indupa, and performance there was reflecting challenging market conditions in Latin America. Now I remind you that last year, we have the profits of Eco Services that we sold at the end of 2014, and we also had the results of the European chlorovinyl business, which now is part of the INOVYN JV since the beginning of July 2015. In short, those 3 factors all relate to portfolio, and this is really a consequence of the development and transformation of the portfolio of the group.
Moving on to cash. Page 14. Cash, as Jean-Pierre said, is EUR 188 million. It's more than 50% higher than last year. Yes, strong working capital discipline. Our ratio of industrial working capital to sales was 15.6% in Q3. That's 0.7% better than last year. Looking ahead, as Jean-Pierre mentioned as well, I want to confirm that we anticipate a smoother working capital profile at year-end compared to last year as well.
CapEx was up by EUR 17 million compared to the third quarter. But it's worth taking note that on a cumulative basis, in the first 3 quarters, our year-to-date CapEx is EUR 672 million. That's EUR 130 million more than last year. About half of that increase is linked to dollar-euro foreign exchange impacts. CapEx levels are totally in line with our expectations, and we also confirm our expectation that looking forward into 2016 and beyond, we do anticipate the reduction in CapEx intensity.
Looking forward on cash. You'll recall that last year had an exceptionally strong Q4 on cash. Just for the continuing businesses, I remind you, had EUR 542 million of free cash flow in Q4 2014. We also highlighted the fact that, that benefited from exceptional performance, really strong performance in working capital, including the recovery of long outstanding VAT receivables.
If I take a step back and share with you, our view is the following: On an underlying basis, taking account of those exceptional factors, leaving aside the cash flows from discontinued businesses, Eco Services, et cetera, we expect our operating cash flow generation this year to be largely flat against last year as a result of reinvesting higher operating profits into higher CapEx, it'd be roughly about EUR 100 million more, again, FX is a big factor, and some working capital build to make sure we're there to meet the needs of our customers early into the year.
Other highlights on cash are essentially the elements on acquisition and divestments of EUR 8 million. Two factors: One, we did receive EUR 150 million in cash on the setup of INOVYN. That became EUR 110 million cash and once we accounted a certain working capital adjustments, and there are noncash deconsolidation effect that impacted net debt as well. We also reflect in those figures a payment for the acquisition of the minority interest in Solvin. Net debt as a result of all those movements reduced from EUR 1.6 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. 
And with this, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

Maybe just a couple of comments to close this soft part of our meeting.
Outlook. First, looking back, we've been able to deliver solid double-digit growth over the past 9 months, 11.5% of REBITDA growth despite significant adjustments in 2 of the markets that we serve. In Q4, we expect to see the usual seasonality, maybe slightly more pronounced than what we've seen in the past year because we think that some of our customers in the current environment will manage very carefully the end-of-year inventories, which are always very important reference points for a lot of our customers in the various supply chains that we serve, but no breakthrough other than this slightly more important than usual seasonal adjustment, and this leads us to reconfirm our expectation of solid REBITDA growth for the full year 2015.
One last point regarding dividend. We have announced our interim dividend as you -- as we usually do, EUR 1.36 per share. It's 40% of 2014 total dividend, so this is just the application of the usual dividend policy at Solvay. Record date is January 20. Payment is January 21. Just to be very clear, this dividend will be served for each of the share the will exist at the time of this record date. As you know, we have announced a rights issue. So it's very important for you to realize that the interim dividend will be paid for all existing share at the time of the record date. However, if we do proceed with the rights issue to finance the acquisition of Cytec, which is our intention, we will adjust the total dividend payment regarding 2015 to reflect the distribution of rights, as it is customary for transaction of this type, so no surprises there. But the adjustment will take place when we will decide the amount of the full dividend, and this will be announced with our Q4 results.
So with that, I suggest we move to the Q&A part of this presentation."

And that, therefore, on a year-on-year basis, the comparable was not that easy. So can you maybe tell us exactly what you mean by lumpiness of the new product launches? Is it that your customers this time have decided to give you the equivalent of 6-month of sales within 1 quarter and that, therefore, Q4 would be weaker?

So indeed, the growth that we are seeing in our results, which is partially due to this market, but most of our markets in Advanced Materials are growing. This is linked to increased market share, increased penetration that we've been able to achieve in this market. And regarding Q4, there was nothing in my comment, which related to specific situation -- to a specific situation of this market. We expect, as I've said, a bit of a more pronounced seasonality this year because of the fact that some of our customers seems to be a bit more prudent. The environment is a little bit more volatile but, again, nothing which was specifically linked to this market. And overall, again, in terms of seasonality of this market, there's no -- they are very similar this year versus last year.

At the same time, I don't want to create an issue on something, which in my view is not an issue. We are usually seeing Q4 as being the lowest quarter of the year. So we've seen in the past probably 4 or 5 years a clear seasonal pattern. We think that this year, it will be slightly more pronounced than it was last year. And the reason, again, and it's not specific to any market or either geography or type of market, is that we see our customers being prudent and probably managing even more carefully than in other years their inventory situation at year-end. So that's the way I see things as we speak but, frankly speaking, not breakthrough versus the pattern we've usually seen but just a bit more pronounced seasonality. On the 2016, frankly speaking, and taking into account all what we have, I don't see any reason for us to vary from the double-digit growth rate trajectory that we have signaled and which is, today, our reference for the -- for our performance until 2016. It's true that we depend on some macro element like foreign exchange, for example. But overall, we see with the new capacity that we've built in 2015 coming online, with the increased penetration of our product in some market, with continuation of very probably a very challenging oil and gas market in North America, with a bit of an improvement on the when acetate tow market, when I add up all of these elements, I think that we are very much in the trajectory, although it's obviously a bit too early to give you a specific guidance for 2016. And by the way, the group perimeter in 2016 will be a bit different from what it is today as we will include Cytec in our perimeter very likely before year-end."

Firstly, in Novecare, Jean-Pierre, what does the word satisfactory mean for your oil production business? Are you starting to see any signs that production-related activity just sort of coming off the peak levels that we've been seeing? Secondly, on Polyamide, I think that the cost-saving program all completed at the end of last year, so what's the driver of the business performance at the moment? Is it that -- something to do with the reinvigorated relationship with investor or just market conditions? Or are you sort of extending your underlying efforts to improve profitability there? And then 2 financial questions, one on -- you talked a lot about industrial and working capital, Karim, but the nonindustrial working capital swings around violently and you referred to it about the fourth quarter impact. Can you give us an idea what you think the non-industrial working capital effect will be for the full year? And in that context, when you talked about operating cash flow, free cash flow being flat year-on-year on an adjusted, adjusted basis, what's the number that we're comparing that to? Is it the 5 11 that you have to continuing operations or -- last year? Or how should we think about that? And the last thing I had was on the bridging finance.

On Novecare satisfactory, sorry, but I think satisfactory means satisfactory. If you look at the overall numbers available regarding the North America oil and gas market, we see a situation where production continue at the very satisfactorily level. I think we are just starting to see a bit of moderation in terms of production. On the contrary, stimulation -- exploration and stimulation have decreased very significantly. So we continue to see a very good level of demand in the production segment, and we continue to perform well in this segment. The reality that at some point of time, production will start to decrease if there is no further effort in stimulation. And I think the key question that I don't have better answers, and all of my colleagues from the oil service companies who have made comments on this subject in the past weeks. At this point of time, the operators in the U.S. will have an important question to answer about their willingness to reinvest in stimulation or not, and I think there will be probably 2 components in their decision. One is the oil price at the time they will make their decision. And the second is the ability to come up with more cost-effective solutions. And on this part, we are working very hard. I think we've made some progress both in the organization and the supply chain and the technology that are making -- we are making available to our customers to make sure that, indeed, they can improve their competitiveness when they will have to reconsider whether they want to prepare for future production on their wells. So again, satisfactory means that we have -- we've performed very well up until now. But it's really a market where we should be prudent before making any comments looking forward. If my memory is correct, I think it's probably the CEO of Schlumberger or maybe the CEO of Halliburton who said a few week -- a few days ago that he has never seen a market so volatile. So our view is that we need to adjust to this. It will come back. I don't have any question, and we want to be ready the day it will come back. Polyamide, yes, I mean, we have ended up our program, that one that we have announced a couple of years ago. We ended it at the end of last year, but we are continuing our efforts. And the good performance of Polyamide is a combination of some of the elements that you've mentioned. We continue to work on costs, both fixed and variable costs. We continue to work on the various optimizations with other players. I mean, it's really a business where swaps, for example, time swap, geographical swap could help improve our position and indeed the market, especially on Polyamide, is reasonably good as we speak. I mean, we see a level of demand, which is fine. We are -- we see a level of production, which is reasonably well aligned with demand. We are continuing to make progress on our downstream Engineering Plastics market in a context where Engineering Plastics is gaining space in the auto wold. So all the team is focused on improving profitability and, indeed, this is visible in our results for the quarter, but it will be also very visible for the full year. Karim?"

It has factors such as taxes, custom duties, provisions, contingency, even litigation. So by their very nature, they don't have the same predictable association with business performance, seasonality, et cetera. We talked about the EUR 511 million of free cash flow that we generated in 2014. Let me just start there, and maybe remind you that we did highlight the outperformance, a very, very strong performance in working capital and VAT. If you want to talk EUR 200 million for that outperformance, and essentially the underlying would be nearer EUR 300 million than EUR 500 million. What we're saying is this year on an underlying basis, we expect to be in that zone and essentially, driven by reinvesting high profits, after-tax clearly, into higher working capital because we would be smoothing and really being ready to tackle the beginning of next year the capacity respond to customers as well as the higher CapEx. That is the nature of the profile we anticipate. On the bridge, a couple of things. One is there is commercial confidentiality issues. I won't give you the specifics. I'll just remind you a couple of things. One, it's a standby facility. Typically, one does not plan on using it. It's available for 2 years. If we were to draw it, complete within our rights to do so, it's very low costs. It's short-term financing, much cheaper in terms of basis points than senior debt. But that's not the point because it's about risk, it's about making sure I have a prudent robust balance sheet. And as I said, it's there as a standby facility and not anything else. There is a step-up mechanistic if we were to draw it down on a quarterly or 6 monthly basis to ensure that we become, say, economically motivated to draw down the finance, the permanent financing, should we need to. But it's really important to have that bridge finance because it doesn't mean we're not compelled to go to the market if conditions aren't exactly the way we would want them to be. Okay, it's really good to have that but the intention and the plan is not to do that down."

For price, we have long-term contract, with -- when I say long term, multiyear contract with pricing structure into them. So it's really a business where we have a significant visibility on our margin and then the valuation is linked to contract renegotiation. But short term, a very satisfactory situation and frankly speaking, even through the contract renegotiations, I think, that we are well positioned in this market where we have a strong leadership position. So no -- not a lot of worry on pricing in Silica. Capacity, yes, indeed, we are very tight. You know Probably that it took us a bit more time than expected to bring the Polish capacity online. We are currently doing the product approval. It's an industry where it takes a long time to approve new products coming from a new plant. But the capacity will up very, very quickly. And in fact, we are already thinking of the next capacity extension probably in Asia. And in terms of regional trend, I think the only meaningful element is a bit of a slowdown in Asia, which is due to the current situation of the automotive industry in China. But overall, solid performance. Any energy-efficient tires are continuing to gain shares in the various regions where they are not already a standard. In Europe, it's -- almost all tires now are energy-efficient but North America and Asia, there are significant opportunities and we continue to see nice growth. Aroma Performance, probably the only meaningful element that I have in mind is that we've seen a bit of a slowdown in China, which is something which is not really material and nothing in comparison with what we've seen for example in the automotive industry, but overall good performance with Aroma."

You referred to sort of getting the U.S. antitrust approvals. Can you just update us in terms of where are you or how comfortable are you once you acquire this asset in terms of some of the defense business that Cytec has? You will be able to continue with this business and you have sort of -- you're very confident on that? That's my second question. The third question really is just relating to your improvement on portfolio comment. How should we think about this in terms of CFROI in 2 years time? I mean, are you still confident that with Cytec, and if you divest some of these businesses that you think you want to, you will still materially improve CFROI over the next couple of years?"

In fact, the slight -- the improvements we've seen on volume are probably more into soda ash and peroxide. I think in his comments, Karim mentioned flattish, which is flattish to slightly positive. And at the end of the day, these are the 2 businesses where we see some volume improvement. It's especially the case of peroxide, which has been doing quite well in terms of finding the opportunities for our product. And yes, indeed Acetow was, we still see versus the same quarter of last year, a significant impact in terms of volume, although the situation is starting to normalize. On the Emerging Biochemicals, more or less flattish -- Emerging Biochemicals is also contributing to the growth of this segment. Cytec, we are very confident on the approval. As I've said, we've got the approval in the U.S. some weeks ago. We are expecting to have the European approval by the early December, and this should conclude as a number of other countries, but we think that Europe is likely to be the last country to give its approval. We have an approval which is linked to the specific nature of Cytec business, which is called CFIUS. We expect also to -- the review period, in fact, ends also early December. So our view is that we should have all the regulatory approvals early December. That's why I'm confident that we should be able to close during the month of December. Frankly speaking, no issue with the defense business. If you look at, for example, the largest defense contract Cytec is the F45. It's a plane that's being sold in various regions, including Europe. And in fact, I probably think that the fact that we become a European-owned or European-headquartered owner of this business probably helps to demonstrate that indeed -- indeed, the supply chain which is used to produce this equipment is indeed a very global supply chain. So we don't see any reluctance to work with Cytec under a different ownership. And on the contrary, I mean, there's clearly, with it's use on the civil airplane side, on the civil airplane side of the business but also on the military, there is a willingness to make sure that the supply chain which support these types of production is becoming even more global, and our position will probably help diversify our production facilities around the world. Second one, Karim, are you ready to give guidance 2 years ahead?"

The other aspect is some of the portfolio transformation. Of course, if we were to monetize some businesses that have very low CFROI drag on the group, that will have a big positive. But it's not impossible to also monetize for value, businesses that have high CFROI. What I can say to you is this, it won't be a 1-year, 6-month trajectory, or even 2 years. But absolutely, this is a portfolio transformation. It's an industrial transformation. It could take 5 years. We started 2 years ago, we're midway through. There is a lot more to be done there.

And the second is on pricing. In Advanced Materials, pricing is up by 1% in Q3, while it was flattish in Q2. And in Advanced Formulations price decrease in Q3, softened versus Q2. So that means in both segments sequentially prices appear to be up. In this -- in a current deflationary scenario, and although you have these long-term price contracts for example in Silica, so can you help me to understand for that development?"

You're asking a level of precision in the answer, which is not always directly available. But on pricing, when I say long-term pricing, these prices, especially in the case of Silica includes deflators. In Silica, we have enough -- we have a pricing formula which takes into account the cost of energy, which is the most important input in Silica production. It's a little bit difficult to make the analysis that you are developing. We see very satisfactory pricing situation in this segment across the board. knowing that it's really a business, which is in the value creation zone, I should say very well in the value creation zone. And then the challenge for us is clearly for this business to increase our penetration and to generate growth. So it's not a business -- we have other segments where the priority is pricing above everything. This is not the case in Advanced Materials, because we think that margins are very satisfactory that return on capital -- CFROI in this segment is much higher than our cost of capital. And then the challenge for us is to generate growth opportunities."

But it's moving as best as we can expect, in an environment which is a bit complex. I remind you that these assets are in Argentina and Brazil, in both cases, countries which are facing a bit of a challenging overall economic and political situation. So not a piece of cake, but the process is moving well with quality parties interested in the assets. On Acetow, our view is very much in line with what I have commented earlier on. We see a situation where volumes are normalizing. I think we -- you probably heard converging comments coming from the players in this market saying that they think that the destocking with the large Western players is behind us. There's probably still some volume in the Chinese supply chain but we are -- our exposure to China is rather limited, so we're probably not the best people to make these type of comments. So we started to see and we expect to continue to see volumes improving over the course of 2016. So yes, we think that this business should come back to a very satisfactory level of performance.

First, I think that the up until now we have delivered a strong performance for the year with very clear drivers. Innovation, ability to gain market share, self-help measure, the excellence initiatives are continuing to pay off and obviously, we've benefited from supportive foreign exchange. We are very committed at Solvay to continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. Cytec is a major step change and I have heard comments here and there of people saying that this is a risk acquisition. Frankly speaking, my level of enthusiasm is still very, very high on this project. I think we are moving very quickly on the integration. We feel real willingness from the other side to make this integration as quick and as effective as possible and to make sure that the synergies we've committed to will be not only delivered but, I think, probably exceeded, especially when it comes to top line synergies where we see a lot of opportunities that we have not identified when we started this project. Portfolio improvement doesn't stop with Cytec. I think there's probably a couple of project that we need to execute in the next couple of years to continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. And yes, indeed, I think that we'll continue on the growth trajectory in the next years. I mean, we have invested significantly within the current Solvay perimeter in new capacity, which are coming online more or less as we speak. This will fuel the growth for 2016. We see Cytec coming in with also very significant growth opportunities. So overall, I think that Solvay will be in a very good position to continue to generate solid growth not only in Q4 but for the next following years. Transformation has been a very important element in Solvay strategy. Transformation has delivered, is delivering, but transformation will continue in the next few years and there is a strong willingness from the management team of Solvay to make sure that we will become indeed a company with a very, very high-quality portfolio very much focused on innovation and having the ability to increase the returns to our shareholder. 
With that, I thank you very much. I remind you that we have an extraordinary shareholder meeting on November 17, which will approve -- which will give the Board of Directors the authorization to proceed with the rights issue in connection with the Cytec acquisition. November 24, Cytec shareholders will vote on the transaction, and we'll see each other in the February 2016.

I'm here in Brussels with Karim and Maria. And we'll try to cover, as usually, pretty quickly to leave enough space for the Q&A part, the main feature of these results.Clear",2031,"Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, to join us for this Q3 results call. I'm here in Brussels with Karim and Maria. And we'll try to cover, as usually, pretty quickly to leave enough space for the Q&A part, the main feature of these results.
Clearly, we've seen that we are presenting to you strong results today, which demonstrate that the transformation journey that we have started with Solvay a couple of years ago is indeed bearing fruits. We think that these Q3 results show some strong evidence of the -- our ability to deliver good organic growth in the quarter based on pricing power underpinned by the various excellence initiatives that we have deployed and that we'll continue to deploy for the company. We think also that the portfolio upgrade that we have done contribute to this performance. But clearly, with Cytec integration, we will see a significant step change, and we think that portfolio will continue to be an important element of the transformation.
When it comes to Q3, the macro context is indeed more challenging than we expected at the beginning of the year. China growth is moderating, although we've seen mostly an impact up until now on the automotive market. Brazil is still in a significant -- is still facing significant economic challenges and low oil price, which weighs differently on some of our business, is overall creating a negative impact on Solvay. This being said, if my memory is correct, this is the sixth quarter in the last 7 quarter where we've delivered double-digit growth. And I think that in this environment, this is indeed a good performance, which shows that we have today a portfolio which allow us to navigate through the various challenges that we see here and there.
If we -- Karim will go into more details on the -- on our numbers but just a few comments. Sales up 5% at EUR 2.7 billion, driven by ForEx. Prices are flat and volume flattish. Prices are flat, but as you know, in an environment where raw materials are going down which means that we've been able to manage our prices quite effectively and, indeed, our pricing power, help us generate REBITDA at EUR 520 million, up 14% versus the same quarter of last year. And if I look at the last 9 months, we have generated a growth of REBITDA of 11.5%, so very much in line with our objective to generate 10% REBITDA growth on the average of the -- of 2014,2016. REBITDA margins strengthened at 19%, so quite a good number in comparison with our peers.
Looking at the drivers of performance. I've mentioned pricing power across segments. Overall net pricing impact of EUR 58 million positive in Q3; since the beginning of the year, EUR 148 million. So clearly, pricing power is a very important feature in the way we deliver our results, especially higher Performance Chemicals and Functional Polymers. But in fact, we see even in some businesses which are currently challenged in terms of volume and market environment, we see us being able to manage very effectively our margins, and this is linked to the various excellent initiatives that we have deployed for the growth both to improve our cost position but also to manage prices per se very effectively.
REBITDA was up, for example, 9% at Performance Chemical cluster, despite the challenges in the tow market. We've doubled at Functional Polymer of restoring profitability from what was a low base. Something which is very important for us is innovation, especially visible this quarter, and I should probably say this year, in our Advanced Materials cluster. Volume up 8%, and it's not just a 1-quarter event. I mean, since the beginning of the year, we've seen an 8% increase in volumes. REBITDA at 26%, up versus last year. Margins up to 27%. Clearly, our largest segment now posts a new record-breaking REBITDA in the quarter. And this is largely due to the ability to bring new, innovative solutions to our customers in market as diverse as smart devices and automotive. And clearly, this segment will continue to play a very significant role in the growth story that Solvay is putting in place.
Excellence initiative, I was mentioning this when we are talking pricing power, but we continue to see a strong contribution from excellence initiatives. In fact, overall, we are expecting a contribution in '15, which will be similar to what we've seen last year, around EUR 300 million, which is once again very much in line with our -- the objective that we've set of generating EUR 800 million by 2016 linked to this excellence initiatives.
In terms of markets, the company is probably well positioned, I should probably say well spread between geographies and end market. Geographies, Asia Pacific today represents 35% of our sales year-to-date. We are continuing to see a slight increase in our exposure there, and again, we continue to see very significant opportunities in this region despite the worries that some people have expressed regarding China. In China, the most important impact that we have perceived is linked to the automotive industry. In the other business that we serve, we think that the -- we continue to see opportunities, which will allow us to continue to develop our positions there.
North America today is stable at 23% of -- representing 23% of our shares -- of our sales, sorry, and Europe slightly reducing. Europe today represents 32% of Solvay's sales.
In terms of end market, we see also a solid situation where we have very good exposures to a quite diverse number of markets. Smart devices and auto continue to be strong. I was mentioning the weakness of the Chinese auto market. This is compensated by the fact that Europe is doing well in terms of position, but probably even more important, we are continuing to gain market share in the auto segment because they are continuing to replace metals for light-weighting application, and this gives us a lot of opportunity in this segment. 
Health care, agro, consumer goods, satisfactory. The significant challenges that we see today are in oil and gas and the acetate cable. Oil and gas, we continue to see a very volatile and difficult-to-predict market in North America. We've seen the North American stimulation market going down 60% year-on-year, very significant. Production market, however, is satisfactory, which is very much in line with the comments that you would hear from other industry players. 
For Novecare, our sales to the oil and gas market have reduced by 30%, so very significant. But we are trying to adjust to this situation by a combination of cost reduction, developing innovative solution, which fits with the strong focus of our customers to improve their competitiveness and cost position. There's a feeling that as soon as the oil price will go up, people will be willing to restart stimulation. But they want to do it with the best possible solutions [indiscernible] the most competitive production costs. And we are working very hard to meet these challenges, and we are also working on other opportunities outside of North America to diversify our exposure.
Acetow, we are starting to see some improvements. The destocking is probably over when we look at the Western players. There's probably still a bit of inventories in the Chinese supply chain, but overall, the situation which is becoming more favorable. 
And just to end these comments on our performance, strong free cash flow generation, EUR 188 million, almost entirely from continuous operation. We continue to focus very much on working capital discipline, making sure that we reduce the peaks, both the low end and the high end in terms of working capital and making sure that throughout the year, we can maintain very satisfactory level of working capital.
2015 is a year of significant CapEx. We knew it. We are currently finalizing a number of projects. We have started our fluoroelastomer plants in China in the last month. We have also commissioned the largest bicarbonate plant in Thailand. And again, these are just 2 out of 9 projects, which we start in 2015. And this explain the significant amount of CapEx that we've spent both in Q3, EUR 223 million. And if you look at the past 9 months, we have spent EUR 672 million in terms of CapEx.
Portfolio upgrade, and I will update you on Cytec. Clearly, it's a major step change that we have announced in July. We are very excited about this project. By the way, you've seen the Cytec results published a few days ago, which confirm that indeed Cytec is doing very well in most of its market and very much in line with the guidance and the expectations that we have shared at the beginning of the year.
The various regulatory approvals are moving according to our expectations. We've received already the clearance on the antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Mexico. We've -- we are progressing very well on the various other clearance that we need. You've seen that Cytec has called for its shareholder meeting in late November. So our expectation to close this deal by year-end is still what we expect to do.
We've been working very hard in the past few weeks to get ready for the integration, and frankly speaking, it will be a very quick integration. We have already put in place a large integration management office. We have more than 200 people working to prepare for the integration. Our expectation is that on day 1, we will have already a clear view of the key element of the organization. And we'll be moving very quickly to deliver on the synergies, and we will take advantage of the fact that in North America, where most of the synergies will be delivered, we can move much faster than in Europe. And our intention is, indeed, to make this integration very quick and an effective one. 
We are also working on financing. You know that we have a bridge loan, which has been secured, but we want to make sure that we can refinance it very, very quickly. We will work on the long-term debt financing end of November, early December, and then we'll make sure that the other component of the financing package can be put in place as quickly as possible. I remind you that as far as the equity is concerned, it's very important for us to have the support of Solvac, our reference shareholders. Solvac has announced that it will take all their rights and that they would participate to the -- they will participate to the rights issue and to the fullest extent of their current position within Solvay.
Frankly speaking, I've seen the integration will move very quickly. We are impressed by the quality of the Cytec team that we've met. And the Cytec management is very supportive of the transaction and willing to make sure that the integration moves as quickly and as efficiently as possible. And our level of expectation regarding Cytec is probably even a bit higher today than it was when we announced the transaction back in July.
Maybe just a final word on this introduction to say that portfolio improvement don't stop with Cytec. I think that in the next couple of years, we'll see a few more significant portfolio of project, maybe more on the divestment side than the -- than on the acquisition, as we will be working very hard to integrate Cytec. And by the way, portfolio upgrade is also the result of some of the CapEx spending that we have done. The project regarding fluoropolymer in China is a very good example of our willingness to strengthen our position in businesses that we consider as being the key growth engine for Solvay. 
Well, sorry, for this a bit of a long introduction, but I'm very pleased now to turn to Karim to ask him to spend a bit more time with you on some of our numbers to give you a bit more color and flavor on what we've achieved during this quarter."

You can see that overall volumes remain largely stable, which actually have been improving over the first half of the year. What's important to note is that most of our activity showed growth. Some such as Specialty Polymers are very much positive outliers, and that progress helped to compensate for the ongoing reduction in the oil and gas market, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, clearly lower volumes in Acetow as well compared to last year. In short, RusVinyl
Acetow is that we're very encouraged to see some modest improvement sequentially in volumes in Q3 compared to the first half of this year as well. 
Pricing, stable overall. REBITDA, as Jean-Pierre said, is up 14%, and margins have expanded from 18% to 19%. The volume impact is negative 3%, and that really is a mix effect and no more. What's particularly encouraging for us in terms of quality of the growth is the pricing power that's been alluded to, and there are 4 factors I'd like to highlight: One, we retain some of the benefit resulting from lower raw materials prices. Two, pricing power across all operating segments, especially Performance Chemicals, were there contributing. Three, transactional ForEx positive EUR 25 million, leading up to net pricing. Fourth, and by no means least, excellence programs really helped introduced our variable costs make us more efficient and contributing EUR 58 million. It's not the first quarter it really showed the ongoing strength of the pricing power in Solvay.
Fixed costs are up with new plants, as Jean-Pierre mentioned. One, I'll refer to it in a moment, what is also worthy to note is the fact that inflationary cost pressures on our fixed costs are being compensated by continued strong delivery and operational excellence. And also the cost increased that you see there is also the effect of one-off negative of EUR 7 million, which is linked to the impairment of carbon emission rights in Brazil.
In summary, as I take a step back and look at these results, I would share with you my view, which is really the fact that highlights the quality of a diversified portfolio combined with a continued momentum, real strong delivery on the excellence programs and helps us to make progress despite the headwinds, oil and gas, acetate tow. 
Now let me take you through some of the businesses on Slide 7. Advanced Formulations, you won't be surprised to see a decline of 8%. And also, you will welcome the fact that we maintain margins in a stable level at 15%. Now in the context of low oil prices and volatile prices, it's not a surprise. The volume drop at Novecare did continue. It's not everywhere. So for example, the oil and gas, cementing, drilling and stimulation, yes, of course, fell. That's not new news. Production subsector demand is holding up quite well. There is some resilience. Good progress is being made in other parts of Novecare and also in other parts of our portfolio. For example, Aroma Performance really recovered very strongly compared to last year, albeit from a low base because we did have the impacts of production issues last year. Coatis also progressed, helped by most supportive foreign exchange impact.
Advanced Materials, EUR 236 million, 26% improvement. It's another consecutive record. Margins expanding 26% to 27%. Now that reflects continued strong demand, mainly Specialty Polymers, in auto and in certain industrial application but, of course, as well in strong demand in smart devices. And we want to acknowledge the fact that order patterns for certain campaigns with smart devices can create an irregular pattern quarter-on-quarter. So we tend to look at this in terms of its very [ph] longer continuum of time and do note strong continued progress even in that space, which is very encouraging. 
Volumes in Silica and Special Chem up as well. Positive net pricing and ForEx helped to more than offset higher fixed costs. Jean-Pierre talked about the new fluoroelastomer plant that we opened in China with Specialty Polymers. We also had the opening in Q2 of the greenfield Silica plant in Poland. All of that will create value as we're investing for future growth. But it does impact, in the short term, fixed costs.
Performance Chemicals, REBITDA up 9%, margins remained flat at 26%. Pricing power is the main contributor, and it helped to more than offset the volume drop in Acetow. Pricing of soda ash and peroxides was strong. Margins also improved in Emerging Biochemicals, particularly as ethylene prices dropped in Southeast Asia, helping to improve our margins. The volume impact, you won't be surprised, was negative and that's largely because of the mix effect. And that reflects the volume drop that, I hope you won't be surprised, is unheard of in a Acetow compared to last year.
Functional Polymers more than doubled their REBITDA to EUR 44 million and expanded their margins from 5% to 12%. And that, again, is primarily attributed to net pricing increases in our Polyamide business, particularly where some of the lower -- some of the benefits of lower raw material prices were able to be possibly retained, for example, in the Engineering Plastics business.
Finally, in Corporate & Business Services, net costs were EUR 66 million compared to EUR 50 million in the same quarter last year. Corporate and function costs were EUR 3 million up, and that really reflects 3 things: cost reductions, very positive; inflation and foreign exchange. The flip side of having a supportive impact of foreign exchange in our profit is a negative impact in our fixed costs. So net EUR 3 million, we view, is very positive in these circumstances. Energy Services had a negative contribution compared to last year, reflecting both the impairment that I referred to of EUR 7 million and somewhat weaker markets in energy and carbon markets.
I'll now turn to the elements below the REBITDA line on Slide 13. There are 3 particular matters I'd like to draw your attention to. Firstly, other elements were EUR 37 million negative, and these relate to financial and foreign exchange impacts on the RusVinyl JV. Now what does that comprise? Essentially talking of EUR 7 million of normal financial interest charges on the debt in the JV but, more importantly, a EUR 27 million foreign exchange-related impact in the euro debt in that Russian ruble JV, and that really reflects a 15% devaluation in the ruble versus the euro. That is what has driven it. 
Secondly, nonrecurring costs are up EUR 31 million against last year for one reason: essentially, EUR 32 million of noncash contingent hedging costs in relation to the Cytec acquisition. Now what does that relate to? It relates to the fact that in announcing the deal to do Cytec, we tried and we did actually secure the dollar cost of acquisition on the equity that we are issuing in euros. So by going for a deal contingent forward, we pay a premium, but we absolutely locked down the euro cost to secure economics. This becomes embedded with the price when we close the deal, but that's just noncash for now. 
Finally, the contribution from discontinued operations was negative. In the third quarter, we only have Indupa, and performance there was reflecting challenging market conditions in Latin America. Now I remind you that last year, we have the profits of Eco Services that we sold at the end of 2014, and we also had the results of the European chlorovinyl business, which now is part of the INOVYN JV since the beginning of July 2015. In short, those 3 factors all relate to portfolio, and this is really a consequence of the development and transformation of the portfolio of the group.
Moving on to cash. Page 14. Cash, as Jean-Pierre said, is EUR 188 million. It's more than 50% higher than last year. Yes, strong working capital discipline. Our ratio of industrial working capital to sales was 15.6% in Q3. That's 0.7% better than last year. Looking ahead, as Jean-Pierre mentioned as well, I want to confirm that we anticipate a smoother working capital profile at year-end compared to last year as well.
CapEx was up by EUR 17 million compared to the third quarter. But it's worth taking note that on a cumulative basis, in the first 3 quarters, our year-to-date CapEx is EUR 672 million. That's EUR 130 million more than last year. About half of that increase is linked to dollar-euro foreign exchange impacts. CapEx levels are totally in line with our expectations, and we also confirm our expectation that looking forward into 2016 and beyond, we do anticipate the reduction in CapEx intensity.
Looking forward on cash. You'll recall that last year had an exceptionally strong Q4 on cash. Just for the continuing businesses, I remind you, had EUR 542 million of free cash flow in Q4 2014. We also highlighted the fact that that benefited from exceptional performance, really strong performance in working capital, including the recovery of long outstanding VAT receivables.
If I take a step back and share with you, our view is the following: On an underlying basis, taking account of those exceptional factors, leaving aside the cash flows from discontinued businesses, Eco Services, et cetera, we expect our operating cash flow generation this year to be largely flat against last year as a result of reinvesting higher operating profits into higher CapEx, it'd be roughly about EUR 100 million more, again, FX is a big factor, and some working capital build to make sure we're there to meet the needs of our customers early into the year.
Other highlights on cash are essentially the elements on acquisition and divestments of EUR 8 million. Two factors: One, we did receive EUR 150 million in cash on the setup of INOVYN. That became EUR 110 million cash and once we accounted a certain working capital adjustments, and there are noncash deconsolidation effect that impacted net debt as well. We also reflect in those figures a payment for the acquisition of the minority interest in Solvin. Net debt as a result of all those movements reduced from EUR 1.6 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. 
And with this, I hand it back to Jean-Pierre."

Maybe just a couple of comments to close this soft part of our meeting.
Outlook. First, looking back, we've been able to deliver solid double-digit growth over the past 9 months, 11.5% of REBITDA growth despite significant adjustments in 2 of the markets that we serve. In Q4, we expect to see the usual seasonality, maybe slightly more pronounced than what we've seen in the past year because we think that some of our customers in the current environment will manage very carefully the end-of-year inventories, which are always very important reference points for a lot of our customers in the various supply chains that we serve, but no breakthrough other than this slightly more important than usual seasonal adjustment, and this leads us to reconfirm our expectation of solid REBITDA growth for the full year 2015.
One last point regarding dividend. We have announced our interim dividend as you -- as we usually do, EUR 1.36 per share. It's 40% of 2014 total dividend, so this is just the application of the usual dividend policy at Solvay. Record date is January 20. Payment is January 21. Just to be very clear, this dividend will be served for each of the share the will exist at the time of this record date. As you know, we have announced a rights issue. So it's very important for you to realize that the interim dividend will be paid for all existing share at the time of the record date. However, if we do proceed with the rights issue to finance the acquisition of Cytec, which is our intention, we will adjust the total dividend payment regarding 2015 to reflect the distribution of rights, as it is customary for transaction of this type, so no surprises there. But the adjustment will take place when we will decide the amount of the full dividend, and this will be announced with our Q4 results.
So with that, I suggest we move to the Q&A part of this presentation."

And the second question within that was my understanding is that last year, in Q3, you already benefited from product launches. And that, therefore, on a year-on-year basis, the comparable was not that easy. So can you maybe tell us exactly what you mean by lumpiness of the new product launches? Is it that your customers this time have decided to give you the equivalent of 6-month of sales within 1 quarter and that, therefore, Q4 would be weaker? Or have you had more than just one product launch? I'm just struggling with this kind of growth on top of Q3. And the second question was for Karim, just on the hybrid issue.

So indeed, the growth that we are seeing in our results, which is partially due to this market, but most of our markets in Advanced Materials are growing. This is linked to increased market share, increased penetration that we've been able to achieve in this market. And regarding Q4, there was nothing in my comment, which related to specific situation -- to a specific situation of this market. We expect, as I've said, a bit of a more pronounced seasonality this year because of the fact that some of our customers seems to be a bit more prudent. The environment is a little bit more volatile but, again, nothing which was specifically linked to this market. And overall, again, in terms of seasonality of this market, there's no -- they are very similar this year versus last year.

So that's the way I see things as we speak but, frankly speaking, not breakthrough versus the pattern we've usually seen but just a bit more pronounced seasonality. On the 2016, frankly speaking, and taking into account all what we have, I don't see any reason for us to vary from the double-digit growth rate trajectory that we have signaled and which is, today, our reference for the -- for our performance until 2016. It's true that we depend on some macro element like foreign exchange, for example. But overall, we see with the new capacity that we've built in 2015 coming online, with the increased penetration of our product in some market, with continuation of very probably a very challenging oil and gas market in North America, with a bit of an improvement on the acetate tow market, when I add up all of these elements, I think that we are very much in the trajectory, although it's obviously a bit too early to give you a specific guidance for 2016. And by the way, the group perimeter in 2016 will be a bit different from what it is today as we will include Cytec in our perimeter very likely before year-end."

On Novecare satisfactory, sorry, but I think satisfactory means satisfactory. If you look at the overall numbers available regarding the North America oil and gas market, we see a situation where production continue at the very satisfactorily level. I think we are just starting to see a bit of moderation in terms of production. On the contrary, stimulation -- exploration and stimulation have decreased very significantly. So we continue to see a very good level of demand in the production segment, and we continue to perform well in this segment. The reality that at some point of time, production will start to decrease if there is no further effort in stimulation. And I think the key question that I don't have better answers, and all of my colleagues from the oil service companies who have made comments on this subject in the past weeks. At this point of time, the operators in the U.S. will have an important question to answer about their willingness to reinvest in stimulation or not, and I think there will be probably 2 components in their decision. One is the oil price at the time they will make their decision. And the second is the ability to come up with more cost-effective solutions. And on this part, we are working very hard. I think we've made some progress both in the organization and the supply chain and the technology that are making -- we are making available to our customers to make sure that, indeed, they can improve their competitiveness when they will have to reconsider whether they want to prepare for future production on their wells. So again, satisfactory means that we have -- we've performed very well up until now. But it's really a market where we should be prudent before making any comments looking forward. If my memory is correct, I think it's probably the CEO of Schlumberger or maybe the CEO of Halliburton who said a few week -- a few days ago that he has never seen a market so volatile. So our view is that we need to adjust to this. It will come back. I don't have any question, and we want to be ready the day it will come back. Polyamide, yes, I mean, we have ended up our program, that one that we have announced a couple of years ago. We ended it at the end of last year, but we are continuing our efforts. And the good performance of Polyamide is a combination of some of the elements that you've mentioned. We continue to work on costs, both fixed and variable costs. We continue to work on the various optimizations with other players. I mean, it's really a business where swaps, for example, time swap, geographical swap could help improve our position and indeed the market, especially on Polyamide, is reasonably good as we speak. I mean, we see a level of demand, which is fine. We are -- we see a level of production, which is reasonably well aligned with demand. We are continuing to make progress on our downstream Engineering Plastics market in a context where Engineering Plastics is gaining space in the auto world. So all the team is focused on improving profitability and, indeed, this is visible in our results for the quarter, but it will be also very visible for the full year. Karim?"

That is the nature of the profile we anticipate. On the bridge, a couple of things. One is there is commercial confidentiality issues. I won't give you the specifics. I'll just remind you a couple of things. One, it's a standby facility. Typically, one does not plan on using it. It's available for 2 years. If we were to draw it, complete within our rights to do so, it's very low costs. It's short-term financing, much cheaper in terms of basis points than senior debt. But that's not the point because it's about risk, it's about making sure I have a prudent robust balance sheet. And as I said, it's there as a standby facility and not anything else. There is a step-up mechanistic if we were to draw it down on a quarterly or 6 monthly basis to ensure that we become, say, economically motivated to draw down the finance, the permanent financing, should we need to. But it's really important to have that bridge finance because it doesn't mean we're not compelled to go to the market if conditions aren't exactly the way we would want them to be. Okay, it's really good to have that but the intention and the plan is not to draw that down."

For price, we have long-term contract, with -- when I say long term, multiyear contract with pricing structure into them. So it's really a business where we have a significant visibility on our margin and then the valuation is linked to contract renegotiation. But short term, a very satisfactory situation and frankly speaking, even through the contract renegotiations, I think, that we are well positioned in this market where we have a strong leadership position. So no -- not a lot of worry on pricing in Silica. Capacity, yes, indeed, we are very tight. You know Probably that it took us a bit more time than expected to bring the Polish capacity online. We are currently doing the product approval. It's an industry where it takes a long time to approve new products coming from a new plant. But the capacity fill up very, very quickly. And in fact, we are already thinking of the next capacity extension probably in Asia. And in terms of regional trend, I think the only meaningful element is a bit of a slowdown in Asia, which is due to the current situation of the automotive industry in China. But overall, solid performance. Energy-efficient tires are continuing to gain shares in the various regions where they are not already a standard. In Europe, it's -- almost all tires now are energy-efficient but North America and Asia, there are significant opportunities and we continue to see nice growth. Aroma Performance, probably the only meaningful element that I have in mind is that we've seen a bit of a slowdown in China, which is something which is not really material and nothing in comparison with what we've seen for example in the automotive industry, but overall good performance with Aroma."

And yes, Ryton is a business which -- this acquisition which is going very well, by the way. Integration was very easy and we are making progress on one of the technical issues that was left to solve when we acquired the business from Chevron Phillips, which was linked to a new technology that they were putting in place in the plant and they had a significant difficulties.

In fact, the slight -- the improvements we've seen on volume are probably more into soda ash and peroxide. I think in his comments, Karim mentioned flattish, which is flattish to slightly positive. And at the end of the day, these are the 2 businesses where we see some volume improvement. It's especially the case of peroxide, which has been doing quite well in terms of finding the opportunities for our product. And yes, indeed Acetow was, we still see versus the same quarter of last year, a significant impact in terms of volume, although the situation is starting to normalize. On the Emerging Biochemicals, more or less flattish -- Emerging Biochemicals is also contributing to the growth of this segment. Cytec, we are very confident on the approval. As I've said, we've got the approval in the U.S. some weeks ago. We are expecting to have the European approval by the early December, and this should conclude as a number of other countries, but we think that Europe is likely to be the last country to give its approval. We have an approval which is linked to the specific nature of Cytec business, which is called CFIUS. We expect also to -- the review period, in fact, ends also early December. So our view is that we should have all the regulatory approvals early December. That's why I'm confident that we should be able to close during the month of December. Frankly speaking, no issue with the defense business. If you look at, for example, the largest defense contract Cytec is the F45. It's a plane that's being sold in various regions, including Europe. And in fact, I probably think that the fact that we become a European-owned or European-headquartered owner of this business probably helps to demonstrate that indeed -- indeed, the supply chain which is used to produce this equipment is indeed a very global supply chain. So we don't see any reluctance to work with Cytec under a different ownership. And on the contrary, I mean, there's clearly, with it's use on the civil airplane side, on the civil airplane side of the business but also on the military, there is a willingness to make sure that the supply chain which support these types of production is becoming even more global, and our position will probably help diversify our production facilities around the world.

It's a little bit difficult to make the analysis that you are developing. We see very satisfactory pricing situation in this segment across the board. knowing that it's really a business, which is in the value creation zone, I should say very well in the value creation zone. And then the challenge for us is clearly for this business to increase our penetration and to generate growth. So it's not a business -- we have other segments where the priority is pricing above everything. This is not the case in Advanced Materials, because we think that margins are very satisfactory that return on capital -- CFROI in this segment is much higher than our cost of capital.

There's probably still some volume in the Chinese supply chain but we are -- our exposure to China is rather limited, so we're probably not the best people to make these type of comments. So we started to see and we expect to continue to see volumes improving over the course of 2016. So yes, we think that this business should come back to a very satisfactory level of performance. You've seen also various -- you've heard various announcements of players in this market adjusting capacities with the market in which -- it's a market in which players are willing to make sure that they can serve as best as possible their customers, but without extra capacity available."

First, I think that the up until now we have delivered a strong performance for the year with very clear drivers. Innovation, ability to gain market share, self-help measure, the excellence initiatives are continuing to pay off and obviously, we've benefited from supportive foreign exchange. We are very committed at Solvay to continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. Cytec is a major step change and I have heard comments here and there of people saying that this is a risky acquisition. Frankly speaking, my level of enthusiasm is still very, very high on this project. I think we are moving very quickly on the integration. We feel real willingness from the other side to make this integration as quick and as effective as possible and to make sure that the synergies we've committed to will be not only delivered but, I think, probably exceeded, especially when it comes to top line synergies where we see a lot of opportunities that we have not identified when we started this project. Portfolio improvement doesn't stop with Cytec. I think there's probably a couple of project that we need to execute in the next couple of years to continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. And yes, indeed, I think that we'll continue on the growth trajectory in the next years. I mean, we have invested significantly within the current Solvay perimeter in new capacity, which are coming online more or less as we speak. This will fuel the growth for 2016. We see Cytec coming in with also very significant growth opportunities. So overall, I think that Solvay will be in a very good position to continue to generate solid growth not only in Q4 but for the next following years. Transformation has been a very important element in Solvay strategy. Transformation has delivered, is delivering, but transformation will continue in the next few years and there is a strong willingness from the management team of Solvay to make sure that we will become indeed a company with a very, very high-quality portfolio very much focused on innovation and having the ability to increase the returns to our shareholder. 
With that, I thank you very much. I remind you that we have an extraordinary shareholder meeting on November 17, which will approve -- which will give the Board of Directors the authorization to proceed with the rights issue in connection with the Cytec acquisition. November 24, Cytec shareholders will vote on the transaction, and we'll see each other in the February 2016. I was looking for the exact date, February 25, I think, for the full year results of Solvay. Thank you very much, and have a very good day."
