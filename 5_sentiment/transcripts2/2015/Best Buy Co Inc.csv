This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the 2 press releases that we issued earlier this morning, including our Q4 earnings release and the second release announcing our plan to return capital to our shareholders. The Q4 earnings release and today's conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events.
These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons that should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. 
As previously announced on December 4, 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Five Star business in China. As a result of this agreement, Five Star was classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal '15 and its results were included in discontinued operations for the current and prior year periods. 
On February 13, Best Buy completed the sale of Five Star. We have recast certain financial information for fiscal 2014 and '15 to reflect the results from the Five Star business as discontinued operation. This recast financial information is available as Exhibit 99.2 in the company's Q4 earnings release 8-K filed this morning and on our IR websites, investors.bestbuy.com. 
Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.
In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by The NPD Group, includes TVs, desktops, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.

I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. I will then discuss the status of our Renew Blue transformation and our priorities for fiscal 2016 before turning the call",2122,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. I will then discuss the status of our Renew Blue transformation and our priorities for fiscal 2016 before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. In the fourth quarter, our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a 1.3% increase in revenue to $14.2 billion and a 23% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $1.48 versus $1.20 last year, primarily driven by growth in our Domestic segment. 
The compelling merchandise assortment and strong multi-channel execution drove these better-than-expected results as we capitalize on the product cycles in large-screen televisions and mobile phones. These 2 categories were the primary drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth and more than offset weakness in the tablet category, which was impacted by material industry declines. 
Our value proposition of expert service, unbeatable price resonated with customers whether they came to us in-store, online or both. We deliver to our customers a strong multi-channel experience, and we were uniquely positioned to serve them through our national retail footprint, online experience, our knowledgeable Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents and our stores-within-a-store. 
We also benefited during the fourth quarter from our investments in inventory availability; mobile phone installment billing; supply chain, including faster store replenishment and online delivery; as well as more effective and relevant marketing. Altogether, these results reflect the successful delivery of our holiday plan. 
We said that we would execute a highly disciplined operating and promotional plan that would drive a better year-over-year financial outcome for our shareholders, and these results reflect that. 
On a full year basis, we continue to make progress against the 2 main problems we had to solve that we outlined in November of 2012: number one, declining comps; and number two, declining operating margins. 
In fiscal 2015, we stabilized comparable sales on a full year basis and delivered incremental non-GAAP SG&A reductions of approximately $420 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 80 basis points and a 26% increase in a non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.60. We also ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash versus $2.6 billion last year. 
These results reflect the cumulative progress since 2012 that will mitigate our Renew Blue transformation initiatives. So to date, we have number one, improved our NPS score by 450 basis points; number two, we've rolled out 71 Pacific Kitchen & Home and 34 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store, in addition to our enhanced vendor experiences; number three, we've implemented ship-from-store across the whole chain, driving significant growth for our business; number four, we increased our Domestic online penetrations from 7% to 9.8% of our revenue; number five, we've gained share across multiple categories; number six, we've delivered $1.02 billion in Renew Blue cost reductions, exceeding our $1 billion target; number seven, we've divested our underperforming European and Chinese businesses; and number eight, we've intensively managed our capital resources and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. 
In light of this progress and as a demonstration of our commitment to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce this morning our plan to return excess capital. This plan allows us to continue to invest in the growth of our business and preserve a strong balance sheet. 
It includes number one, a special onetime dividend of $0.51 per share or approximately $180 million related to the net after-tax proceeds from LCD-related legal settlements received in the last 3 fiscal years; number two, a 21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share; and number three, the resumption of share repurchases with the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next 3 years. 
So before I turn to our plans for this year, I want to publicly thank our employees for the impact of their hard work. We have a very talented and dedicated set of leaders and employees at Best Buy, and it is an honor to lead this group of amazing individuals and a privilege to work with each and every one of them. 
Now as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on driving comparable sales and improving operating margins while funding investments in our future. As we have previously shared, we are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices to our customers. 
Within this strategy, we're focused on driving the number of growth initiatives around key product categories like events and services. And to drive these initiatives, we are pursuing and investing in the transformation of our key functions and processes. 
To provide more color on these initiatives, which reflect continued execution against the 24 months road map that we outlined a year ago, I will now provide specific actions we intend to pursue in fiscal 2016. 
So the first initiative of our road map is merchandising. Our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior end-to-end customer experience that yields enhanced financial returns. In pursuit of that, we plan number one, to capitalize on the ultra-high definition TV cycle through best-in-class merchandising, assortment and customer experience, including opening approximately 20 additional Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 78; number two, we plan to accelerate our expansion in growing categories with structural barriers to entry like larger appliances and mobile phones, including opening approximately 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 177 as well as extending our installment billing selling capability online; number three, we plan to grow our Connected Home and Health and Wearable businesses to an optimized assortment and improved multi-channel customer experience; number four, we plan to increase our branded, exclusive and private label assortments; number five, we plan to expand our secondary market growth strategy to offer consumers better access to these types of products and improve our margin recovery on returns, replaced and damaged products; and number six, we plan to have more signs behind our promotional and pricing strategies. 
We will also, as part of this merchandising trust, expand our programs to capture customers at a time of key life events and build long-term relationships with them, including our new mover program and our wedding gift registry, which we launched in February. 
The second initiative is marketing, which provides, of course, crucial support for our merchandising growth opportunities. In marketing, we will accelerate our executive marketing programs by leveraging Athena customer database to expand personalization beyond e-mail campaigns. We will extend the personalization of our targeted e-mail campaigns by dynamically serving relevant landing pages when customers click through to our website. We will continue the evolution of our marketing spend from analog and mass to digital and personalized mediums such as search, mobile devices and targeting, and we will continue to increase the number of addressable e-mails in our customer database. 
The next initiative on our road map is online. Our goal here is to our serve our customers based on how, where and when they want to be served and capture online shares. In pursuit of that goal, we will continue to develop true omni-channel experiences, including number one, improving the online visibility of returns open-box inventory; number two, extending our installment billing selling capability online; number three, enhancing the online experience for appliance purchases; number four, expanding capabilities for life events like the wedding registry and wish list; and number five, providing an integrated Geek Squad customer experience across channels and devices and driving increased attach rates. 
We will also be continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and accelerating the transformation of our mobile customer experience, which we will support through our new technology development center in Seattle. Similar to general industry trends, our traffic from mobile phones is growing much faster than traditional desktop traffic, and we are increasing our mobile investments accordingly. It is imperative that we engage mobile customers with improved and streamlined access to essential, rich product information during the discovery, research and checkout processes. 
The next initiative in our road map is retail stores. In our retail stores, we're building on the good momentum from our success in fiscal 2015, and we will be driving increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage and focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates. We will be enhancing our in-store customer experience from both an expert service and physical environment perspective, including expanding product training for associates; and number three, we will be driving growth by implementing market plans that are tailored to specific geographies. 
The next initiative in our road map is services. In fiscal 2015, we significantly reduced our legacy cost structure and improved our services-related NPS scores. We also launched a loss and theft mobile phone insurance program and more complete technology support bundles. Now despite these accomplishments, revenue has been declining largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile revenue due to our success in decreasing claim severity and frequency, which is an operational positive. 
So in fiscal 2016, we will be focused on continuing to transform our traditional service offerings to better address customer needs. We will be integrating the Geek Squad customer experience into bestbuy.com to provide an enhanced service experience to our customers and to increase online attach rates. We'll be continuing to improve our delivery and installation experience, and we'll be increasing the investment in marketing and selling our service offerings. 
The next initiative on our road map is supply chain. Our goal with supply chain is to leverage our network and improve our customer experience with increased inventory availability, improved speed to customer and improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our large key assortments. 
In pursuit of that goal, we will unlock additional inventory for ship-from-store. We will continue to pursue cost efficiencies through technology enhancements, including the replacement of our warehouse management system. We will drive growth in large appliances and large TVs by leveraging new digital inventory capabilities launched in October, and we will invest in improving our home delivery and installation services NPS. 
The last initiative in our road map is our cost structure. So with the $55 million in additional annualized cost reductions announced today, in the past 2 years, we have delivered over $1 billion in North American Renew Blue cost reductions. 
In fiscal 2016, we are launching Phase 2 of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program with a target of approximately $400 million over 3 years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunity. These savings, because they are structural in nature, are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 and will be driven by streamlined processes and operational efficiencies that will be primarily enabled through investments in systems. 
We expect, however, that these incremental savings will be significantly offset by the investments we need to make to fund our growth initiatives. In fiscal 2016, we expect these incremental investments to total approximately $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS and fall in 3 main buckets. 
One is the customer experience online and in our retail stores. Two is information technology, and three is marketing. 
We also expect to increase our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to approximately $650 million to $700 million from $550 million in fiscal 2015. 
So the strategy we just outlined is the foundation for our fiscal 2016 operating plan, and we are confident in our ability to execute against this as we've demonstrated this past year. But we'll also be facing industry and economic pressures that we discussed last quarter and in our holiday sales press release that we expect to impact our business, including more rapidly declining average selling prices in key product categories, weak industry demand in certain product categories, declining demands and price pressures from our extended warranties and increasingly competitive and costly customer service expectations like free and faster shipping. 
So to win against this backdrop, investing now is imperative. And while these investments will put pressure on our fiscal 2016 operating income rates, as Sharon will discuss, we believe they leverage our executional momentum and will allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and a foundation for long-term success. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our financial outlook for the first half of fiscal 2016."
255397,280189071,774620,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2015",2015-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective, enterpr",1375,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. 
From a top line perspective, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.3%, excluding the 70 basis point impact of installment billing, was slightly above our near 1% expectation. Our non-GAAP operating income rates expansion of 130 basis points was also above our 75 to 90 basis point expectation due to higher-than-expected vendor participation in our holiday promotional activity. 
Combined, these better-than-expected outcomes equated to an incremental $0.10 of EPS. We also saw a positive $0.03 per diluted share of a nonrecurring tax benefit, which partially offset the previously communicated negative $0.10 impact from the reorganization of our European legal entity. 
I'll now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.3% to $14.2 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.28 to $1.48, primarily driven by a more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy, better performance of our credit card agreement, the positive flow-through of our gross profit enhancement initiatives, the flow-through of higher year-over-year revenue and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These favorable impacts were partially offset, however, by the negative $0.07 per diluted share impact in income tax expense that I just discussed. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.2% to $12.7 billion despite a 3.2% decline in the NPD-reported consumer electronics category. Our revenue growth was driven by comparable sales growth of 2%, excluding the estimated 80 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a $68 million or 55 basis point improvement in the performance for our credit card agreement versus a negative $65 million or 50 basis point impact last year. 
Domestic online revenue on a comparable basis increased 9.7% to $1.7 billion, primarily due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January of 2014. Higher conversion rates and increased traffic, driven by greater investments in online marketing, also contributed to our year-over-year growth. This growth, however, was substantially offset by a material industry softness in tablets, a category with high online penetration; and a channel shift in mobile revenue that resulted from the customers' enthusiasm for installment billing plans, which could only be sold in our retail stores. 
As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 13.5% versus 12.6% last year. Versus last year's online growth, this year's online comparable sales growth of 9% was lower for 2 primary reasons. 
First, we saw the expected 600 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming console introductions and our initial 400 store ship-from-store rollout. We also saw approximately 500 basis points of unexpected additional pressure from tablets and mobile for the reasons that I just discussed. 
As all of these pressures, however, are expected to continue into Q1 and the impact of gaming and our chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store will increase from 600 basis points of pressure in Q4 to 1,000 basis points in Q1, online growth in Q1 is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From a merchandising perspective during the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth in television, mobile phones and computing was significantly offset by the material declines in tablet. 
The growth in mobile phone was primarily driven by higher year-over-year selling prices. We also saw continued comparable sales declines in Services in Q4. This decline of 11.4% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenues due to our success in decreasing claim frequency and lower attach rates. 
In our International segment, revenue did decline 12.4% to $1.5 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of 750 basis points, a comparable sales decline of 4% due to industry declines in Canada and the loss of revenues from store closures in Canada. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth of mobile phones was more than offset by declines in tablets, gaming and digital imaging. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the fourth quarter was 21.3% versus 20.2% last year, an increase of 110 basis points. The Domestic gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 21.2% versus 20% last year. This increase was primarily due to the more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy; the ongoing improvements in supply chain efficiencies and higher margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; a 40 basis point positive impact related to our credit card agreement as compared to a negative 40 basis point impact in Q4 of last year; and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. 
These increases were partially offset by structural investments in price competitiveness, particularly in accessories. The International gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 21.7%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.2 billion or 15.5% of revenue versus 15.7% last year, an increase of $9 million but a reduction of 20 basis points in rates. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 15.3% of revenue versus 15.5% last year, an increase of $41 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and Renew Blue investments in customer-facing initiatives. 
These increases were partially offset by the realization of our Renew Blue cost-reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. The 20 basis point rate improvement was driven by year-over-year sales leverage. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $262 million or 17.3% of revenue versus 17% of revenue last year, a decline in dollars of $32 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency, lower expenses due to store closures in Canada and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions in Canada. The 30 basis point rate increase was driven by year-over-year sales de-leverage. 
Also as it relates to the International segment, we completed the sale of our Five Star business in China and continue to focus on Renew Blue transformation in Canada. 
I would now like to talk about fiscal '16. In fiscal '16, we expect the financial impact of the investments and economic pressures that Hubert discussed earlier to begin in Q1 and continue throughout the year. 
From a top line perspective, our current expectation is consistent with the outlook we provided in our holiday sales release. While we are optimistic about the potential of new product launches, our limited visibility to timing and quantities keep us cautious. 
As such, our Q1 and Q2 expectations for enterprise revenue and comparable sales growth, excluding the estimated impact of installment billing, continues to be in the range of flat to negative low single digits. This change in trend versus Q4 is primarily driven by ongoing material declines in the tablet category, in addition to holiday momentum around high-profile giftable products not continuing post holiday. We will also be anniversary-ing approximately 80 basis points of Enterprise Growth in the first half of last year, driven by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store. 
From a non-GAAP operating income rate perspective, we are also reiterating our outlook for Q1 and Q2 of down approximately 30 to 50 basis points, including lapping last year's Q1 15 basis point onetime benefit associated with the new credit card agreement. This decline reflects the economic and growth pressures that we just outlined, the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our anticipated SG&A inflation. 
Additionally, we expect the Q1 and Q2 non-GAAP continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 40%. But despite these first half pressures, we are encouraged by the execution momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for next year. While we remain cautious on the overall industry, the strength of the Best Buy brand and our track record of improving our operational performance provides us with a strong confidence in our ability to deliver against the road map that we outlined today. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We will continue to be working on the disciplined approach that we are taking to our promotional strategies and continuing to also work on our Renew Blue cost reductions as it relates to the gross profit. But predominantly, our pressures in 2016 are clearly coming from the SG&A line. As you talked about the incremental investments that we are making, they are in capabilities. Competitively, we're going to be more cautious this year about talking about specifically where we're putting them, but when you think about the things that Hubert outlined in quite a bit of detail, we are investing in our categories where we see big barriers to entry such as Appliances and in the Mobile business. We are investing in our supply chain. We are investing behind our rollout of life events and gift registry. Remember, those are initiatives that will have an extended tail as far as revenue goes. So we're going to invest in the marketing and the capabilities upfront and then the revenue to flow in a later date. So again, you end up with early on investment. We'll also, as we talked about, be making some major investments in systems. We talked about the new warehouse management system. Of course, we have our ongoing investment in online. Hubert talked about the integration of Geek Squad into our business as well as some of the initiatives we have around our Services businesses, which will also require both capital and expense investments in 2016. So those would be the major buckets, under which we will be investing. I'll add one more, which I know you all have seen the benefit of. Hubert talked about the adding of the pack sales and the Magnolia Design Centers within our stores. These have been very successful for us. We expect to continue to do that. The other thing you saw last year and certainly you saw us do it and you saw the customer response to it through the comp that went along with it was the investments that we've made in our stores either the vendor investment in the physical presence of our stores or what we have done there. We are finding that there are ways for us to significantly enhance the customer experience through investment in the transformation of the footprint within the 4 walls of our stores, and we expect to continue to invest in that this year as well because we like -- we are really very much seeing the customer react and respond to what we've done there."

The initial payback on some of these investments will happen in the back half of the year. The difference between the investments we've been making, the last 2 years of Renew Blue and the investments that we're making now, these are much more structural, and they will actually come incrementally. As an example, some of the work that we are doing in the supply chain, we will rollout a portion this year, a portion next year and a portion after that. Returns, replacements and damages is another one. We will create the capability online this year then there are things that we will add to the system that we'll implement going into Q4, and that will go into next year and the year after. So when we look at that $400 million that Hubert laid out, we were very deliberate in how we talked about that because those are the areas where we are going to see improvements and cost reduction and margin enhancement. But they are going to be very gradual and incremental as they flow through. So that is how we see it. Obviously, we're not going to be guiding it by quarter, by year, but basically over the next 3 years, we expect to see these both not only driving the cost lines but also driving the top line. Our investments -- most of our investments right now and ones that I think are going to be most substantial are actually going to be investments that are to drive top line growth, and so you're going to see both on the top line and coming through the operating income rate."

But before I answer directly the question, let me say a couple of things about Services. Number one, I'm very proud of the work that our 20,000 Geek Squad agents do everyday in our stores, online or when they go into clients' homes to install or support some of the toys that we sell to our customers. Number two, I'm very proud of the progress that we've made with our Net Promoter Score in Services and some of the new offers we've introduced. Now clearly, we also have a lot of work to do to continue the transformation. We've laid out a number of priorities around the transformation of our traditional service offerings, developing the Geek Squad experience online and in the multi-channel fashion, improving delivery and installation and then increasing the investments in marketing and selling our Services. And speaking supporting our growth in integrated fashion as we go to market with a customer experience that leverages our unique capabilities, which, of course, include the Geek Squad. So just in case anyone of you would like to apply for the job, let me answer your question now around the profile. We are looking for somebody who's almost a CEO for that business. This is a real business within our business, somebody who combines strong operational performance as well as a strong strategic and growth-oriented approach, somebody who's good with cost and customers, somebody who's good with technology and online as well as high touch experiences, and somebody who's going to help us improve what we have, which is a great set of assets but take it to the next level. So of course, we are launching -- we've launched an external search. In the meantime, Services will report directly to me. We'll have great help from several of my colleagues, but the fact that Services will report directly to me is, of course, an indication of the strategic importance we see for Services today and in our future strategy."

I guess if my math is right that the contribution to the comp or the top line from TV is somewhere in the mid-single digits. We realize the tablets are weak, but laptops are helping, but I think you also have appliances that are healthy. So I'm just trying to get a little more color on bridging the gap from where that contribution has come from TV to how we get back to flat to negative low singles. Is it more slippage in healthy categories? Or do you see some of the decline in categories getting a little weaker?"

In Q4, we saw the tablet category down 30% approximately. The NPD reported category down 30%. And at any point in time, Best Buy is going to have a 20% plus share of that category. So it has a significant impact on our top line, has a lesser impact on our profitability. As you know, it's not one of our most profitable categories. But certainly, it drives a lot of traffic to our stores. The other contributor to -- from Q3 or Q4 to Q1 is what we called out, which was the 80 basis points of growth that was driven last year by the 1,400 store rollout of ship-from-store. 80 basis points is substantial, and so that is another pressure because remember, last year, in Q4, we only rolled out all the stores starting in January. So we only had 400 stores shipping in the first 2 months of the fourth quarter, and then we have 1,400 shipping in the fourth quarter. So the year-over-year comp for Q1 is much, much more difficult than it was in Q4. Another area, and we're not going to go into extensive detail on it, it's highly competitive is also the discussion we had in the Q3 conference call around a more disciplined promotional strategy. Hubert cleverly defined it as following the rats into the rathole, so to speak, around the Black Friday holiday sort of time frames, but there other times during the year when you see similar behaviors. And so there is a very rationalized approach, and we'll continue to execute that. I'm sure that you can see it flowing through the gross profit rate. So that's another area, but certainly less impactful than the other 2 that I just described."

So we feel that this is our first step as we go into our third year of the transformation. As we talked about, we have some additional investments to make this year. And as we get through this year, and we see how we progress, of course, this will be a conversation we have each year. We obviously, are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.

So it's been a good approach. In terms of retention, one of the things we're very excited about is our investments in our Athena customer database and our more personalized communication. As we develop these -- continue to develop these capabilities, we've made progress last year, we'll make more progress this year, this will be a very important strategic weapon for us as we move forward as we can talk to the individual customers.

So versus our original expectations for this year, if you just go back to the beginning of the year as we've been giving you an outlook each quarter, the place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first",328,"Yes. So versus our original expectations for this year, if you just go back to the beginning of the year as we've been giving you an outlook each quarter, the place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first half of the year, we had the tremendous SG&A savings, but then in the back half, we made some investments. So while the SG&A was certainly a highlight and year-over-year, certainly a huge driver of our year-over-year improvement, the place where we really made more progress than we expected was in our gross profit. Two drivers of that. One is the investments that we've made. One came from some of the SG&A we invested, of course, which was in this pricing and promotional capability and some of the decisions that we made around that. The other thing in Q4 that we would attribute our success to was the highly disciplined marketing plan to backup the merchandising. Clearly, the merchandise assortment was very strong in Q4, and then that was, of course, supported by the marketing, which was extremely targeted, focused and effective. We told you guys that the year prior that this was an area we had to work on. There was greater emphasis put in that area. So -- but in the end, the other place where we saw an exceptional outcome was merchandising, inventory. There was a lot of drama in Q4 towards various things. One of the core competencies of Best Buy is inventory management, and obviously, our positioning from a merchandising point of view with the vendors also contributed. There were some great products, and Best Buy had the great products. So it was a combination of a lot of things, but when you look at the P&L and you want to put it down on a piece of paper, it was really the top line and the gross profit improvements that we've been able to drive."

And thank you for your kind comments. Services is really you could say 2 major components. One is the extended warranties, which is more Insurance business and Insurance business; and two, Services that help customers take advantage of implements with these toys that we sell them. We see enormous opportunities there. When you step back, the technology that's available today is more complex, richer than it's ever been, and there's a growing gap between what these technologies, these products can do and the understanding of customers about the possibilities. Also it's increasingly connected. Think about it 15 years ago. That's a long time ago. In our homes, we had a personal computer, maybe connected to a printer and a fax line with dial up service and then we had a CRT TV, some audio equipment. So now everything is connected. You have multiple networks in your house, and it's complex, and it's complex to implement. It's complex to support. It's complex to take advantage of. So we see enormous opportunities to help customers in this area as part of our strategy to grow in the various categories we've talked about, and we're uniquely positioned there because there is only so much you can -- I mean, there's a lot we can do remotely, and today, we can troubleshoot your computer remotely using online tools, but there's a limit to this. And we are -- we have this gift, which is we have these 20,000 people, Geek Squad agents at the company and including those who are getting to people's homes and to support and set up a network and everything that goes around it, that's a very unique capability. So I think that's going to be the core theme. So there's going to be work on making sure that the excellent warranty and product-specific services are highly competitive and are effectively marketed and promoted and sold and then there's building you could say this professional services offering instead of capabilities to help our customers."

We have made substantial progress in this area, and we've made about as much progress as we can make without major structural changes to our system and our capabilities of being able to show that product in the online channel. So that's the structural investments that we're making this year in order to take that initiative to the next level. So you are seeing it. Your recollection of the things we've said is absolutely correct, and we expect to see more going into 2016. As you know, we did bring up that product on the website.

And promotion, of course, is a science where tools and science and experience are really important. And last year, we invested in teams and tools and capabilities that allowed us to have better information. Also I think that our team probably use more wisdom as well. It's a combination, right? To illustrate the point, in some cases, you may have a particular competitor that has a certain product with limited quantities and a price set up or a promotion set up to drive traffic to their outlets. In some cases, it may make sense for us to match. In other cases, it may not make sense to match when we have much bigger quantities, and they have very limited capabilities. So I would say the way we manage competitive reaction this year with the help of this additional science was very helpful. So we're very proud of our team there. And it's combined with a very strong assortment and marketing also give us more confidence to execute. Retail is really about execution. And given the ability of our teams to execute in an orderly fashion was I think a very important point of our holiday. So I hope these comments are helpful.

As a result of this agreement, Five Star was classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal '15 and its results were included in discontinued operations for the current and prior year periods. On February 13, Best Buy completed the sale of Five Star.

So first, our financial results. In the fourth quarter, our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a 1.3% increase in revenue to $14.2 billion and a 23% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $1.48 versus $1.20 last year, primarily driven by growth in our Domestic segment. A compelling merchandise assortment and strong multichannel execution drove these better-than-expected results as we capitalize on the product cycles in large-screen televisions and mobile phones. These 2 categories were the primary drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth and more than offset weakness in the tablet category, which was impacted by material industry declines. 
Our value proposition of expert service, unbeatable price resonated with customers, whether they came to us in-store, online or both. We delivered to our customers a strong multichannel experience, and we were uniquely positioned to serve them through our national retail footprint, our online experience, our knowledgeable Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents and our stores-within-a-store. We also benefited during the fourth quarter from our investments in inventory availability; mobile phone installment billing; supply chain, including faster store replenishment and online delivery; as well as more effective and relevant marketing. Altogether, these results reflect the successful delivery of our holiday plan. We said that we would execute a highly disciplined operating and promotional plan that would drive a better year-over-year financial outcome for our shareholders, and these results reflect that. 
On a full year basis, we continue to make progress against the 2 main problems we had to solve that we outlined in November of 2012: number one, declining comps; and number two, declining operating margins. In fiscal 2015, we stabilized comparable sales on a full year basis and delivered incremental non-GAAP SG&A reductions of approximately $420 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 80 basis points and a 26% increase in a non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.60. We also ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash versus $2.6 billion last year. 
These results reflect the cumulative progress since 2012 that we have met against our Renew Blue transformation initiatives. So to date, we have: number one, improved our NPS score by 450 basis points; number two, we've rolled out 71 Pacific Kitchen & Home and 34 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store, in addition to our enhanced vendor experiences; number three, we've implemented ship-from-store across the whole chain, driving significant growth for our business; number four, we've increased our Domestic online penetrations from 7% to 9.8% of our revenue; number five, we've gained share across multiple categories; number six, we've delivered $1.02 billion in Renew Blue cost reductions, exceeding our $1 billion target; number seven, we've divested our underperforming European and Chinese businesses; and number eight, we've intensively managed our capital resources and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. 
In light of this progress and as a demonstration of our commitment to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce this morning our plan to return excess capital. This plan allows us to continue to invest in the growth of our business and preserves a strong balance sheet. It includes: number one, a special onetime dividend of $0.51 per share or approximately $180 million related to the net after-tax proceeds from LCD-related legal settlements received in the last 3 fiscal years; number two, a 21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share; and number three, the resumption of share repurchases with the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next 3 years. 
So before I turn to our plans for this year, I want to publicly thank our employees for the impact of their hard work. We have a very talented and dedicated set of leaders and employees at Best Buy. And it is an honor to lead this group of amazing individuals and a privilege to work with each and every one of them. 
Now as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on driving comparable sales and improving operating margins while funding investments in our future. As we have previously shared, we are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices to our customers. Within this strategy, we're focused on driving a number of growth initiatives around key product categories, like events and services. And to drive these initiatives, we are pursuing and investing in the transformation of our key functions and processes. To provide more color on these initiatives, which reflect continued execution against the 24 months road map that we outlined a year ago, I will now provide specific actions we intend to pursue in fiscal 2016. 
So the first initiative of our road map is merchandising. Our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior end-to-end customer experience that yields enhanced financial returns. In pursuit of that, we plan, number one, to capitalize on the ultra-high definition TV cycle through best-in-class merchandising, assortment and customer experience, including opening approximately 20 additional Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 78; number two, we plan to accelerate our expansion in growing categories with structural barriers to entry, like large appliances and mobile phones, including opening approximately 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 177 as well as extending our installment billing selling capability online; number three, we plan to grow our connected home and health and wearable businesses to an optimized assortment and improved multichannel customer experience; number four, we plan to increase our branded, exclusive and private label assortments; number five, we plan to expand our secondary market growth strategy to offer consumers better access to these types of products and improve our margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; and number six, we plan to apply more signs behind our promotional and pricing strategies. We will also, as part of this merchandising trust, expand our programs to capture customers at the time of key life events and build long-term relationships with them, including our new mover program and our wedding gift registry, which we launched in February. 
The second initiative is marketing, which provides, of course, crucial support for our merchandising growth opportunities. In marketing, we will accelerate our targeted marketing programs by leveraging Athena customer database to expand personalizations beyond email campaigns. We will extend the personalization of our targeted email campaigns by dynamically serving relevant landing pages when customers click through to our website. We will continue the evolution of our marketing spend from analog and mass to digital and personalized mediums, such as search, mobile devices and retargeting. And we will continue to increase the number of addressable emails in our customer database. 
The next initiative in our road map is online. Our goal here is to our serve our customers based on how, where and when they want to be served and capture online share. In pursuit of that goal, we will continue to develop true omni-channel experiences, including: number one, improving the online visibility of return to open-box inventory; number two, extending our installment billing selling capability online; number three, enhancing the online experience for appliance purchases; number four, expanding capabilities for life events, like the wedding registry and Wish List; and number five, providing an integrated Geek Squad customer experience across channels and devices and driving increased attach rates. We will also be continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and accelerating the transformation of our mobile customer experience, which we will support through our new technology development center in Seattle. Similar to general industry trends, our traffic from mobile phones is growing much faster than traditional desktop traffic. And we are increasing our mobile investments accordingly. It is imperative that we engage mobile customers with improved and streamlined access to essential, rich product information during the discovery, research and checkout processes. 
The next initiative in our road map is retail stores. In our retail stores, we're building on the good momentum from our success in fiscal 2015. And we will be driving increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage through focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates. We will be enhancing our in-store customer experience from both an expert service and physical environment perspective, including expanding product training for associates. And number three, we will be driving growth by implementing market plans that are tailored to specific geographies. 
The next initiative in our road map is services. In fiscal 2015, we significantly reduced our legacy cost structure and improved our services-related NPS scores. We also launched a loss-and-theft mobile phone insurance program and more complete technology support bundles. Now despite these accomplishments, revenue has been declining largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile revenue due to our success in decreasing claim severity and frequency, which is an operational positive. So in fiscal 2016, we will be focused on continuing to transform our traditional service offerings to better address customer needs. We will be integrating the Geek Squad customer experience into bestbuy.com to provide an enhanced service experience to our customers and to increase online attach rates. We'll be continuing to improve our delivery and installation experience. And we'll be increasing the investment in marketing and selling our service offerings. 
The next initiative in our road map is supply chain. Our goal with supply chain is to leverage our network and improve our customer experience with increased inventory availability, improved speed to customer and improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our large key assortments. In pursuit of that goal, we will unlock additional inventory for ship-from-store. We will continue to pursue cost efficiencies through technology enhancements, including the replacement of our warehouse management system. We will drive growth in large appliances and large TVs by leveraging the new digital inventory capabilities launched in October. And we will invest in improving our home delivery and installation services NPS. 
The last initiative in our road map is our cost structure. So with the $55 million in additional annualized cost reductions announced today, in the past 2 years, we have delivered over $1 billion in North American Renew Blue cost reductions. In fiscal 2016, we are launching Phase 2 of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program with a target of approximately $400 million over 3 years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunity. These savings, because they are structural in nature, are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 and will be driven by streamlined processes and operational efficiencies that will be primarily enabled through investments in systems. 
We expect, however, that these incremental savings will be significantly offset by the investments we need to make to fund our growth initiatives. In fiscal 2016, we expect these incremental investments to total approximately $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS and fall in 3 main buckets: one is the customer experience online and in our retail stores; two is information technology; and three is marketing. We also expect to increase our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to approximately $650 million to $700 million from $550 million in fiscal 2015. 
So the strategy we just outlined is the foundation for our fiscal 2016 operating plan. And we are confident in our ability to execute against this as we have demonstrated this past year. But we'll also be facing industry and economic pressures that we discussed last quarter and in our holiday sales press release that we expect to impact our business, including more rapidly declining average selling prices in key product categories, weak industry demand in certain product categories, declining demands and price pressures from our extended warranties and increasingly competitive and costly customer service expectations, like free and faster shipping. 
So to win against this backdrop, investing now is imperative. And while these investments will put pressure on our fiscal 2016 operating income rates, as Sharon will discuss, we believe they leverage our executional momentum and will allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and a foundation for long-term success. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our financial outlook for the first half of fiscal 2016."
255397,280189071,774762,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2015",2015-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective, enterpris",1376,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.3%, excluding the 70 basis point impact of installment billing, was slightly above our near 1% expectation. Our non-GAAP operating income rates expansion of 130 basis points was also above our 75 to 90 basis point expectation due to higher-than-expected vendor participation in our holiday promotional activity. Combined, these better-than-expected outcomes equated to an incremental $0.10 of EPS. We also saw a positive $0.03 per diluted share of a nonrecurring tax benefit, which partially offset the previously communicated negative $0.10 impact from the reorganization of our European legal entity. 
I'll now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.3% to $14.2 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.28 to $1.48, primarily driven by a more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy, better performance of our credit card agreement, the positive flow-through of our gross profit enhancement initiatives, the flow-through of higher year-over-year revenue and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These favorable impacts were partially offset, however, by the negative $0.07 per diluted share impact in income tax expense that I just discussed. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.2% to $12.7 billion despite a 3.2% decline in the NPD reported consumer electronics categories. Our revenue growth was driven by comparable sales growth of 2%, excluding the estimated 80 basis point benefit associated with installment billing, and a $68 million or 55 basis point improvement in the performance for our credit card agreement versus a negative $65 million or 50 basis point impact last year. Domestic online revenue on a comparable basis increased 9.7% to $1.7 billion, primarily due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January of 2014. Higher conversion rates and increased traffic, driven by greater investment in online marketing, also contributed to our year-over-year growth. This growth, however, was substantially offset by material industry softness in tablets, a category with high online penetration, and a channel shift in mobile revenue that resulted from the customers' enthusiasm for installment billing plans, which could only be sold in our retail stores. 
As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 13.5% versus 12.6% last year. Versus last year's online growth, this year's online comparable sales growth of 9% was lower for 2 primary reasons. First, we saw the expected 600 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming console introductions and our initial 400 store ship-from-store rollout. We also saw approximately 500 basis points of unexpected additional pressure from tablets and mobile for the reasons that I just discussed. As all of these pressures, however, are expected to continue into Q1 and the impact of gaming and our chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store will increase from 600 basis points of pressure in Q4 to 1,000 basis points in Q1, online growth in Q1 is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. 
From a merchandising perspective during the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth in televisions, mobile phones and computing was significantly offset by the material declines in tablet. The growth in mobile phone was primarily driven by higher year-over-year selling prices. We also saw continued comparable sales declines in services in Q4. This decline of 11.4% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decreasing claim frequency and lower attach rates. 
In our International segment, revenue did decline 12.4% to $1.5 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of 750 basis points, a comparable sales decline of 4% due to industry declines in Canada and the loss of revenue from store closures in Canada. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth of mobile phones was more than offset by declines in tablets, gaming and digital imaging. 
Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the fourth quarter was 21.3% versus 20.2% last year, an increase of 110 basis points. The Domestic gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 21.2% versus 20% last year. This increase was primarily due to the more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy; the ongoing improvements in supply chain efficiencies and higher margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; a 40 basis point positive impact related to our credit card agreement as compared to a negative 40 basis point impact in Q4 of last year; and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These increases were partially offset by structural investments in price competitiveness, particularly in accessories. The International gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 21.7%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.2 billion or 15.5% of revenue versus 15.7% last year, an increase of $9 million but a reduction of 20 basis points in rates. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 15.3% of revenue versus 15.5% last year, an increase of $41 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and Renew Blue investments in customer-facing initiatives. These increases were partially offset by the realization of our Renew Blue cost-reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. The 20 basis point rate improvement was driven by year-over-year sales leverage. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $262 million or 17.3% of revenue versus 17% of revenue last year, a decline in dollars of $32 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency, lower expenses due to store closures in Canada and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions in Canada. The 30 basis point rate increase was driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. Also as it relates to the International segment, we completed the sale of our Five Star business in China and continue to focus on Renew Blue transformation in Canada. 
I would now like to talk about fiscal '16. In fiscal '16, we expect the financial impact of the investments and economic pressures that Hubert discussed earlier to begin in Q1 and continue throughout the year. From a top line perspective, our current expectation is consistent with the outlook we provided in our holiday sales release. While we are optimistic about the potential of new product launches, our limited visibility due to timing and quantities keep us cautious. As such, our Q1 and Q2 expectations for enterprise revenue and comparable sales growth, excluding the estimated impact of installment billing, continues to be in the range of flat to negative low single digits. This change in trend versus Q4 is primarily driven by ongoing material declines in the tablet category, in addition to holiday momentum around high-profile giftable products not continuing post holiday. We will also be anniversary-ing approximately 80 basis points of enterprise growth in the first half of last year, driven by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store. 
From a non-GAAP operating income rate perspective, we are also reiterating our outlook for Q1 and Q2 of down approximately 30 to 50 basis points, including lapping last year's Q1 15 basis point onetime benefit associated with the new credit card agreement. This decline reflects the economic and growth pressures that we just outlined, the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our anticipated SG&A inflation. Additionally, we expect the Q1 and Q2 non-GAAP continuing operations' effective income tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 40%. 
But despite these first half pressures, we are encouraged by the execution momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for next year. While we remain cautious on the overall industry, the strength of the Best Buy brand and our track record of improving our operational performance provides us with a strong confidence in our ability to deliver against the road map that we outlined today. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And we expect those to begin in the first quarter. We've actually already begun. And those will continue obviously throughout this year. We will continue to be working on the disciplined approach that we're taking to our promotional strategies and continuing to also work on our Renew Blue cost reductions as it relates to the gross profit. But predominantly, our pressures in 2016 are clearly coming from the SG&A line. As you talked about the incremental investments that we are making, bear in capabilities. Competitively, we're going to be more cautious this year about talking about specifically where we're putting them. But when you think about the things that Hubert outlined in quite a bit of detail, we are investing in our categories where we see big barriers to entry, such as appliances and in the mobile business. We are investing in our supply chain. We are investing behind our rollout of life events and gift registry. Remember, those are initiatives that will have an extended tail as far as revenue goes. So we're going to invest in the marketing and the capabilities upfront, and then the revenue to flow at a later date. So again you end up with early-on investments. We'll also, as we talked about, be making some major investments in systems. We talked about a new warehouse management system. Of course, we have our ongoing investment in online. Hubert talked about the integration of Geek Squad into our business as well as some of the initiatives we have around our services businesses, which will also require some both capital and expense investments in 2016. So those would be the major buckets under which we will be investing. I'll add one more, which I know you all have seen a benefit of. Hubert talked about the adding of the Pac Sales and the Magnolia Design stores-within-our-stores. These have been very successful for us. We expect to continue to do that. The other thing you saw last year, and certainly you saw us do it and you saw the customer response to it through the comp that went along with it, was the investments that we've made in our stores, either the vendor investment in the physical presence of our stores or what we have done there. We are finding that there are ways for us to significantly enhance the customer experience through investment in the transformation of the footprint within the 4 walls of our stores. And we expect to continue to invest in that this year as well because we like -- we are really very much seeing the customer react and respond to what we have done there."

The initial payback on some of these investments will happen in the back half of the year. The difference between the investments we've been making the last 2 years of Renew Blue and the investments that we're making now, these are much more structural and they will actually come incrementally. As an example, some of the work that we are doing in the supply chain, we will roll out a portion this year, a portion next year and a portion after that. Returns, replacements and damages is another one. We will create the capability online this year, then there are things that we will add to the system that we'll implement going into Q4. And that will go into next year and the year after. So when we looked at that $400 million that Hubert laid out, we were very deliberate in how we talked about that because those are the areas where we are going to see improvements and cost reduction and margin enhancement. But they are going to be very gradual and incremental as they flow through. So that is how we see it. Obviously, we're not going to be guiding it by quarter, by year. But basically, over the next 3 years, we expect to see these both not only driving the cost lines but also driving the top line. Our investments -- most of our investments right now and ones that I think are going to be most substantial are actually going to be investments that are -- to drive top line growth. And so you're going to see it both on the top line and coming through the operating income rate."

Number two, I'm very proud of the progress that we've made with our Net Promoter Score in services and some of the new offers we've introduced. Now clearly, we also have a lot of work to do to continue the transformation. We have laid out a number of priorities around the transformation of our traditional service offerings, developing the Geek Squad experience online and in a multichannel fashion, improving delivery and installation and increasing the investments in marketing and selling our services, and more broadly speaking, supporting our growth in an integrated fashion as we go to market with a customer experience that leverages our unique capabilities, which, of course, include the Geek Squad. So just in case any one of you would like to apply for the job, let me answer your question now around the profile. We are looking for somebody who's almost a CEO for that business. This is a real business within our business, somebody who combines strong operational performance as well as a strong strategic and growth-oriented approach, somebody who is good with cost and customers, somebody who is good with technology and online as well as high-touch experiences and somebody who is going to help us improve what we have, which is a great set of assets but take it to the next level. So of course, we are launching -- we've launched an external search. In the meantime, services will report directly to me. I will have great help from several of my colleagues.

The other contributor to -- from Q3 -- or Q4 to Q1 is what we called out, which was the 80 basis points of growth that was driven last year by the 1,400 store rollout of ship-from-store. 80 basis points is substantial. And so that is another pressure because remember, last year, in Q4, we only rolled out all of the stores starting in January. So we only had 400 stores shipping in the first 2 months of the fourth quarter, and then we have 1,400 shipping in fourth quarter. So the year-over-year comp for Q1 is much, much more difficult than it was in Q4. Another area, and we're not going to go into extensive detail on it, it's highly competitive, is also the discussion we had in the Q3 conference call around a more disciplined promotional strategy. Hubert cleverly defined it as following the rats into the rathole, so to speak, around the Black Friday holiday sort of timeframes. But there other times during the year when you see similar behaviors. And so there is a very rationalized approach, and we'll continue to execute that. I'm sure that you can see it flowing through in the gross profit rate. So that's another area but certainly less impactful than the other 2 that I just described."

However, we do also, as I told you guys we would, we do also believe there's a point where you're carrying too much cash, thus the reason for our return on capital plan. So we feel that this is our first step as we go into our third year of the transformation. As we talked about, we have some additional investments to make this year. And as we get through this year, and we see how we progress, of course, this will be a conversation we have each year. We obviously are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. I think -- I hope at least that today's announcement demonstrates that. And we continue to believe that our approach is prudent at this point. So more to come coming into next year. We've got a year to deliver. Let's just keep in mind, we've got a whole year to deliver here. But obviously, today's announcement shows our first step."

So it's been a good approach. In terms of retention, one of the things we're very excited about is our investments in our Athena customer database and our more personalized communication. As we develop these -- continue to develop these capabilities, we've made progress last year, we'll make more progress this year, this will be a very important strategic weapon for us as we move forward as we can talk to the individual customers.

So versus our original expectations for this year, if you just go back to the beginning of the year, as we've been giving you an outlook each quarter, the place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first",328,"Yes. So versus our original expectations for this year, if you just go back to the beginning of the year, as we've been giving you an outlook each quarter, the place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first half of the year, we had the tremendous SG&A savings. But then in the back half, we made some investments. So while the SG&A was certainly a highlight, and year-over-year, certainly a huge driver of our year-over-year improvement, the place where we really made more progress than we expected was in our gross profit. Two drivers of that. One is the investments that we've made. One came from some of the SG&A we invested, of course, which was in this pricing and promotional capability and some of the decisions that we made around that. The other thing in Q4 that we would attribute our success to was a highly disciplined marketing plan to back up the merchandising. Clearly, the merchandise assortment was very strong in Q4. And then that was, of course, supported by the marketing, which was extremely targeted, focused and effective. We told you guys that the year prior that this was an area we had to work on. There was great emphasis put in that area. But in the end, the other place where we saw an exceptional outcome was merchandising, inventory. There was a lot of drama in Q4, which strikes various things. One of the core competencies at Best Buy is inventory management. And obviously, our positioning from a merchandising point of view with the vendors also contributed. There were some great products. And Best Buy had the great products. So it was a combination of a lot of things. But when you look at the P&L and you want to put it down on a piece of paper, it was really the top line and the gross profit improvements that we've been able to drive."

We see enormous opportunities there. When you step back, the technology that's available today is more complex, richer than it's ever been and there's a growing gap between what these technologies, these products can do and the understanding of customers about the possibilities. Also it's increasingly connected. Think about it 15 years ago. That's a long time ago. In our homes, we had a personal computer, maybe connected to a printer and a fax line with dial-up service, and then we had a CRT TV, some audio equipment. Now everything is connected. You have multiple networks in your house, and it's complex. And it's complex to implement. It's complex to support. It's complex to take advantage of. So we see enormous opportunities to help customers in this area as part of our strategy to grow in the various categories we've talked about. And we're uniquely positioned there because there's only so much you can -- I mean, there's a lot we can do remotely. And today, we can troubleshoot your computer remotely using online tools. But there's a limit to this. And we have this gift, which is we have these 20,000 people, Geek Squad agents of the company, including those who are get into people's homes and to support and set up a network and everything that goes around it, that's a very unique capability. So I think that's going to be the core theme. So there's going to be work on making sure that the excellent warranty and product-specific services are highly competitive and are effectively marketed and promoted and sold.

So that's kind of an indication because that was a potential impact of about $350 million. We have made substantial progress in this area. And we've made about as much progress as we can make without major structural changes to our systems and our capabilities of being able to show that product in the online channel. So that's the structural investments that we're making this year in order to take that initiative to the next level. So you are seeing it. Your recollection of the things we've said is absolutely correct. And we expect to see more going into 2016. As you know, we did bring up that product on the website.

Pricing and promotion, of course, is a science, where tools and science and experience are really important. And last year, we invested in teams and tools and capabilities that allowed us to have better information. Also I think that our team probably used more wisdom as well. It's a combination, right? To illustrate the point, in some cases, you may have a particular competitor that has a certain product with limited quantities and a price set up to or a promotion set up to drive traffic to their outlets. In some cases, it may make sense for us to match. In other cases, it may not make sense to match when we have much bigger quantities and they have very limited capabilities. So I would say the way we manage competitive reaction this year with the help of this additional science was very helpful. So I was very proud of our team there. And combined with a very strong assortment and marketing also give us more confidence to execute. Retail is really about execution. And given the ability of our teams to execute in an orderly fashion was, I think, a very important point of our holiday. So I hope these comments are helpful. Thank you so much. And in closing, earlier on the call, I thanked our teams at Best Buy for delivering these great results. In closing, I'd like to, of course, thank our shareholders for your support and the confidence you're placing in us.

As a result of this agreement, Five Star was classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal '15 and its results were included in discontinued operations for the current and prior year periods. On February 13, Best Buy completed the sale of Five Star. We have recast certain financial information for fiscal 2014 and '15 to reflect the results from the Five Star business as discontinued operations.

I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. I will then discuss the status of our Renew Blue transformation and our priorities for fiscal 2016 before turning the call",2126,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. I will then discuss the status of our Renew Blue transformation and our priorities for fiscal 2016 before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. In the fourth quarter, our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a 1.3% increase in revenue to $14.2 billion and a 23% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $1.48 versus $1.20 last year, primarily driven by growth in our Domestic segment. A compelling merchandise assortment and strong multichannel execution drove these better-than-expected results as we capitalize on the product cycles in large-screen televisions and mobile phones. These 2 categories were the primary drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth and more than offset weakness in the tablet category, which was impacted by material industry declines. 
Our value proposition of expert service, unbeatable price resonated with customers, whether they came to us in-store, online or both. We delivered to our customers a strong multichannel experience, and we were uniquely positioned to serve them through our national retail footprint, our online experience, our knowledgeable Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents and our stores-within-a-store. We also benefited during the fourth quarter from our investments in inventory availability; mobile phone installment billing; supply chain, including faster store replenishment and online delivery; as well as more effective and relevant marketing. Altogether, these results reflect the successful delivery of our holiday plan. We said that we would execute a highly disciplined operating and promotional plan that would drive a better year-over-year financial outcome for our shareholders, and these results reflect that. 
On a full year basis, we continue to make progress against the 2 main problems we had to solve that we outlined in November of 2012: number one, declining comps; and number two, declining operating margins. In fiscal 2015, we stabilized comparable sales on a full year basis and delivered incremental non-GAAP SG&A reductions of approximately $420 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 80 basis points and a 26% increase in a non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.60. We also ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash versus $2.6 billion last year. 
These results reflect the cumulative progress since 2012 that we have made against our Renew Blue transformation initiatives. So to date, we have: number one, improved our NPS score by 450 basis points; number two, we've rolled out 71 Pacific Kitchen & Home and 34 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store, in addition to our enhanced vendor experiences; number three, we've implemented ship-from-store across the whole chain, driving significant growth for our business; number four, we've increased our Domestic online penetrations from 7% to 9.8% of our revenue; number five, we've gained share across multiple categories; number six, we've delivered $1.02 billion in Renew Blue cost reductions, exceeding our $1 billion target; number seven, we've divested our underperforming European and Chinese businesses; and number eight, we've intensively managed our capital resources and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. 
In light of this progress and as a demonstration of our commitment to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce this morning our plan to return excess capital. This plan allows us to continue to invest in the growth of our business and preserves a strong balance sheet. It includes: number one, a special onetime dividend of $0.51 per share or approximately $180 million related to the net after-tax proceeds from LCD-related legal settlements received in the last 3 fiscal years; number two, a 21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share; and number three, the resumption of share repurchases with the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next 3 years. 
So before I turn to our plans for this year, I want to publicly thank our employees for the impact of their hard work. We have a very talented and dedicated set of leaders and employees at Best Buy. And it is an honor to lead this group of amazing individuals and a privilege to work with each and every one of them. 
Now as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on driving comparable sales and improving operating margins while funding investments in our future. As we have previously shared, we are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices to our customers. Within this strategy, we're focused on driving a number of growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services. And to drive these initiatives, we are pursuing and investing in the transformation of our key functions and processes. To provide more color on these initiatives, which reflect continued execution against the 24 months road map that we outlined 1 year ago, I will now provide specific actions we intend to pursue in fiscal 2016. 
So the first initiative of our road map is merchandising. Our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior end-to-end customer experience that yields enhanced financial returns. In pursuit of that, we plan, number one, to capitalize on the ultra-high definition TV cycle through best-in-class merchandising, assortment and customer experience, including opening approximately 20 additional Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 78; number two, we plan to accelerate our expansion in growing categories with structural barriers to entry, like large appliances and mobile phones, including opening approximately 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 177 as well as extending our installment billing selling capability online; number three, we plan to grow our connected home and health and wearable businesses to an optimized assortment and improved multichannel customer experience; number four, we plan to increase our branded, exclusive and private label assortments; number five, we plan to expand our secondary market growth strategy to offer consumers better access to these types of products and improve our margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; and number six, we plan to apply more signs behind our promotional and pricing strategies. We will also, as part of this merchandising thrust, expand our programs to capture customers at the time of key life events and build long-term relationships with them, including our new mover program and our wedding gift registry, which we launched in February. 
The second initiative is marketing, which provides, of course, crucial support for our merchandising growth opportunities. In marketing, we will accelerate our targeted marketing programs by leveraging Athena customer database to expand personalizations beyond email campaigns. We will extend the personalization of our targeted email campaigns by dynamically serving relevant landing pages when customers click through to our website. We will continue the evolution of our marketing spend from analog and mass to digital and personalized mediums, such as search, mobile devices and retargeting. And we will continue to increase the number of addressable emails in our customer database. 
The next initiative in our road map is online. Our goal here is to our serve our customers based on how, where and when they want to be served and capture online share. In pursuit of that goal, we will continue to develop true omni-channel experiences, including: number one, improving the online visibility of return to open-box inventory; number two, extending our installment billing selling capability online; number three, enhancing the online experience for appliance purchases; number four, expanding capabilities for life events, like the wedding registry and Wish List; and number five, providing an integrated Geek Squad customer experience across channels and devices and driving increased attach rates. We will also be continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and accelerating the transformation of our mobile customer experience, which we will support through our new technology development center in Seattle. Similar to general industry trends, our traffic from mobile phones is growing much faster than traditional desktop traffic. And we are increasing our mobile investments accordingly. It is imperative that we engage mobile customers with improved and streamlined access to essential, rich product information during the discovery, research and checkout processes. 
The next initiative in our road map is retail stores. In our retail stores, we're building on the good momentum from our success in fiscal 2015. And we will be driving increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage through focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates. We will be enhancing our in-store customer experience from both an expert service and physical environment perspective, including expanding product training for associates. And number three, we will be driving growth by implementing market plans that are tailored to specific geographies. 
The next initiative in our road map is services. In fiscal 2015, we significantly reduced our legacy cost structure and improved our services-related NPS scores. We also launched a loss-and-theft mobile phone insurance program and more complete technology support bundles. Now despite these accomplishments, revenue has been declining largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile revenue due to our success in decreasing claim severity and frequency, which is an operational positive. So in fiscal 2016, we will be focused on continuing to transform our traditional service offerings to better address customer needs. We will be integrating the Geek Squad customer experience into bestbuy.com to provide an enhanced service experience to our customers and to increase online attach rates. We'll be continuing to improve our delivery and installation experience. And we'll be increasing the investment in marketing and selling our service offerings. 
The next initiative in our road map is supply chain. Our goal with supply chain is to leverage our network and improve our customer experience with increased inventory availability, improved speed to customer and improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our large key assortments. In pursuit of that goal, we will unlock additional inventory for ship-from-store. We will continue to pursue cost efficiencies through technology enhancements, including the replacement of our warehouse management system. We will drive growth in large appliances and large TVs by leveraging the new digital inventory capabilities launched in October. And we will invest in improving our home delivery and installation services NPS. 
The last initiative in our road map is our cost structure. So with the $55 million in additional annualized cost reductions announced today, in the past 2 years, we have delivered over $1 billion in North American Renew Blue cost reductions. In fiscal 2016, we are launching Phase 2 of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program with a target of approximately $400 million over 3 years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunity. These savings, because they are structural in nature, are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 and will be driven by streamlined processes and operational efficiencies that will be primarily enabled through investments in systems. 
We expect, however, that these incremental savings will be significantly offset by the investments we need to make to fund our growth initiatives. In fiscal 2016, we expect these incremental investments to total approximately $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS and fall in 3 main buckets: one is the customer experience online and in our retail stores; two is information technology; and three is marketing. We also expect to increase our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to approximately $650 million to $700 million from $550 million in fiscal 2015. 
So the strategy we just outlined is the foundation for our fiscal 2016 operating plan. And we are confident in our ability to execute against this as we have demonstrated this past year. But we'll also be facing industry and economic pressures that we discussed last quarter and in our holiday sales press release that we expect to impact our business, including more rapidly declining average selling prices in key product categories, weak industry demand in certain product categories, declining demands and price pressures from our extended warranties and increasingly competitive and costly customer service expectations, like free and faster shipping. 
So to win against this backdrop, investing now is imperative. And while these investments will put pressure on our fiscal 2016 operating income rates, as Sharon will discuss, we believe they leverage our executional momentum and will allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and a foundation for long-term success. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our financial outlook for the first half of fiscal 2016."
255397,280189071,774982,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2015",2015-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective, enterpris",1375,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.3%, excluding the 70 basis point impact of installment billing, was slightly above our near 1% expectation. Our non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 130 basis points was also above our 75 to 90 basis point expectation due to higher-than-expected vendor participation in our holiday promotional activity. Combined, these better-than-expected outcomes equated to an incremental $0.10 of EPS. We also saw a positive $0.03 per diluted share of a nonrecurring tax benefit, which partially offset the previously communicated negative $0.10 impact from the reorganization of our European legal entity. 
I'll now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.3% to $14.2 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.28 to $1.48, primarily driven by a more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy, better performance of our credit card agreement, the positive flow-through of our gross profit enhancement initiatives, the flow-through of higher year-over-year revenue and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These favorable impacts were partially offset, however, by the negative $0.07 per diluted share impact in income tax expense that I just discussed. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.2% to $12.7 billion despite a 3.2% decline in the NPD reported consumer electronics categories. Our revenue growth was driven by comparable sales growth of 2%, excluding the estimated 80 basis point benefit associated with installment billing, and a $68 million or 55 basis point improvement in the performance of our credit card agreement versus a negative $65 million or 50 basis point impact last year. Domestic online revenue on a comparable basis increased 9.7% to $1.7 billion, primarily due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January of 2014. Higher conversion rates and increased traffic, driven by greater investment in online marketing, also contributed to our year-over-year growth. This growth, however, was substantially offset by material industry softness in tablets, a category with high online penetration, and a channel shift in mobile revenue that resulted from the customers' enthusiasm for installment billing plans, which could only be sold in our retail stores. 
As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 13.5% versus 12.6% last year. Versus last year's online growth, this year's online comparable sales growth of 9% was lower for 2 primary reasons. First, we saw the expected 600 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming console introductions and our initial 400 store ship-from-store rollout. We also saw approximately 500 basis points of unexpected additional pressure from tablets and mobile for the reasons that I just discussed. As all of these pressures, however, are expected to continue into Q1 and the impact of gaming and our chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store will increase from 600 basis points of pressure in Q4 to 1,000 basis points in Q1, online growth in Q1 is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. 
From a merchandising perspective during the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth in televisions, mobile phones and computing was significantly offset by the material declines in tablet. The growth in mobile phone was primarily driven by higher year-over-year selling prices. We also saw continued comparable sales declines in services in Q4. This decline of 11.4% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decreasing claim frequency and lower attach rates. 
In our International segment, revenue did decline 12.4% to $1.5 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of 750 basis points, a comparable sales decline of 4% due to industry declines in Canada and the loss of revenue from store closures in Canada. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth of mobile phones was more than offset by declines in tablets, gaming and digital imaging. 
Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the fourth quarter was 21.3% versus 20.2% last year, an increase of 110 basis points. The Domestic gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 21.2% versus 20% last year. This increase was primarily due to the more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy; the ongoing improvements in supply chain efficiencies and higher margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; a 40 basis point positive impact related to our credit card agreement as compared to a negative 40 basis point impact in Q4 of last year; and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These increases were partially offset by structural investments in price competitiveness, particularly in accessories. The International gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 21.7%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.2 billion or 15.5% of revenue versus 15.7% last year, an increase of $9 million but a reduction of 20 basis points in rates. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 15.3% of revenue versus 15.5% last year, an increase of $41 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and Renew Blue investments in customer-facing initiatives. These increases were partially offset by the realization of our Renew Blue cost-reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. The 20 basis point rate improvement was driven by year-over-year sales leverage. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $262 million or 17.3% of revenue versus 17% of revenue last year, a decline in dollars of $32 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency, lower expenses due to store closures in Canada and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions in Canada. The 30 basis point rate increase was driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. Also as it relates to the International segment, we completed the sale of our Five Star business in China and continue to focus on Renew Blue transformation in Canada. 
I would now like to talk about fiscal '16. In fiscal '16, we expect the financial impact of the investments and economic pressures that Hubert discussed earlier to begin in Q1 and continue throughout the year. From a top line perspective, our current expectation is consistent with the outlook we provided in our holiday sales release. While we are optimistic about the potential of new product launches, our limited visibility due to timing and quantities keep us cautious. As such, our Q1 and Q2 expectations for enterprise revenue and comparable sales growth, excluding the estimated impact of installment billing, continues to be in the range of flat to negative low single digits. This change in trend versus Q4 is primarily driven by ongoing material declines in the tablet category, in addition to holiday momentum around high-profile giftable products not continuing post-holiday. We will also be anniversary-ing approximately 80 basis points of enterprise growth in the first half of last year, driven by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store. 
From a non-GAAP operating income rate perspective, we are also reiterating our outlook for Q1 and Q2 of down approximately 30 to 50 basis points, including lapping last year's Q1 15 basis point onetime benefit associated with the new credit card agreement. This decline reflects the economic and growth pressures that we just outlined, the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our anticipated SG&A inflation. Additionally, we expect the Q1 and Q2 non-GAAP continuing operations' effective income tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 40%. 
But despite these first half pressures, we are encouraged by the execution momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for next year. While we remain cautious on the overall industry, the strength of the Best Buy brand and our track record of improving our operational performance provides us with a strong confidence in our ability to deliver against the road map that we outlined today. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And we expect those to begin in the first quarter. We've actually already begun. And those will continue obviously throughout this year. We will continue to be working on the disciplined approach that we're taking to our promotional strategies and continuing to also work on our Renew Blue cost reductions as it relates to the gross profit. But predominantly, our pressures in 2016 are clearly coming from the SG&A line. As you talked about the incremental investments that we are making, bear in capabilities. Competitively, we're going to be more cautious this year about talking about specifically where we're putting them. But when you think about the things that Hubert outlined in quite a bit of detail, we are investing in our categories where we see big barriers to entry, such as appliances and in the mobile business. We are investing in our supply chain. We are investing behind our rollout of life events and gift registry. Remember, those are initiatives that will have an extended tail as far as revenue goes. So we're going to invest in the marketing and the capabilities upfront, and then the revenue to flow at a later date. So again you end up with early-on investments. We'll also, as we talked about, be making some major investments in systems. We talked about a new warehouse management system. Of course, we have our ongoing investment in online. Hubert talked about the integration of Geek Squad into our business as well as some of the initiatives we have around our services businesses, which will also require some both capital and expense investments in 2016. So those would be the major buckets under which we will be investing. I'll add one more, which I know you all have seen a benefit of. Hubert talked about the adding of the Pac Sales and the Magnolia Design stores-within-our-stores. These have been very successful for us. We expect to continue to do that. The other thing you saw last year, and certainly you saw us do it and you saw the customer response to it through the comp that went along with it, was the investments that we've made in our stores, either the vendor investment in the physical presence of our stores or what we have done there. We are finding that there are ways for us to significantly enhance the customer experience through investment in the transformation of the footprint within the 4 walls of our stores. And we expect to continue to invest in that this year as well because we like -- we are really very much seeing the customer react and respond to what we have done there."

The initial payback on some of these investments will happen in the back half of the year. The difference between the investments we've been making the last 2 years of Renew Blue and the investments that we're making now, these are much more structural and they will actually come incrementally. As an example, some of the work that we are doing in the supply chain, we will roll out a portion this year, a portion next year and a portion after that. Returns, replacements and damages is another one. We will create the capability online this year, then there are things that we will add to the system that we'll implement going into Q4. And that will go into next year and the year after. So when we looked at that $400 million that Hubert laid out, we were very deliberate in how we talked about that because those are the areas where we are going to see improvements and cost reduction and margin enhancement. But they are going to be very gradual and incremental as they flow through. So that is how we see it. Obviously, we're not going to be guiding it by quarter, by year. But basically, over the next 3 years, we expect to see these both not only driving the cost lines but also driving the top line. Our investments -- most of our investments right now and ones that I think are going to be most substantial are actually going to be investments that are -- to drive top line growth. And so you're going to see it both on the top line and coming through the operating income rate."

Number two, I'm very proud of the progress that we've made with our Net Promoter Score in services and some of the new offers we've introduced. Now clearly, we also have a lot of work to do to continue the transformation. We have laid out a number of priorities around the transformation of our traditional service offerings, developing the Geek Squad experience online and in a multichannel fashion, improving delivery and installation and increasing the investments in marketing and selling our services, and more broadly speaking, supporting our growth in an integrated fashion as we go to market with a customer experience that leverages our unique capabilities, which, of course, include the Geek Squad. So just in case any one of you would like to apply for the job, let me answer your question now around the profile. We are looking for somebody who's almost a CEO for that business. This is a real business within our business, somebody who combines strong operational performance as well as a strong strategic and growth-oriented approach, somebody who is good with cost and customers, somebody who is good with technology and online as well as high-touch experiences and somebody who is going to help us improve what we have, which is a great set of assets but take it to the next level. So of course, we are launching -- we've launched an external search. In the meantime, services will report directly to me. I will have great help from several of my colleagues. But the fact that services will report directly to me is, of course, an indication of the strategic importance we see for services today and in our future strategy."

In Q4, we saw the tablet category down 30% approximately. The NPD reported category down 30%. And at any point in time, Best Buy is going to have a 20% plus share of that category. So it has a significant impact on our top line, has a lesser impact on our profitability. As you know, it's not one of our most profitable categories. But certainly, it drives a lot of traffic to our stores. The other contributor to -- from Q3 -- or Q4 to Q1 is what we called out, which was the 80 basis points of growth that was driven last year by the 1,400 store rollout of ship-from-store. 80 basis points is substantial. And so that is another pressure because remember, last year, in Q4, we only rolled out all of the stores starting in January. So we only had 400 stores shipping in the first 2 months of the fourth quarter, and then we have 1,400 shipping in fourth quarter. So the year-over-year comp for Q1 is much, much more difficult than it was in Q4. Another area, and we're not going to go into extensive detail on it, it's highly competitive, is also the discussion we had in the Q3 conference call around a more disciplined promotional strategy. Hubert cleverly defined it as following the rats into the rathole, so to speak, around the Black Friday holiday sort of timeframes. But there other times during the year when you see similar behaviors. And so there is a very rationalized approach, and we'll continue to execute that. I'm sure that you can see it flowing through in the gross profit rate. So that's another area but certainly less impactful than the other 2 that I just described."

We've been very clear that we would not make big announcements because our priority has been -- in fact, the biggest leverage for us has been to improve the performance of our stores through the investments in the customer experience, the multichannel approach and so forth. So it's been a good approach. In terms of retention, one of the things we're very excited about is our investments in our Athena customer database and our more personalized communication. As we develop these -- continue to develop these capabilities, we've made progress last year, we'll make more progress this year, this will be a very important strategic weapon for us as we move forward as we can talk to the individual customers. Closing stores, when you don't have this capability, is a waste of a lot of resources. So I think we're seeing the continuation of what we've been saying and what we've been doing."

So versus our original expectations for this year, if you just go back to the beginning of the year, as we've been giving you an outlook each quarter, the place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first",328,"Yes. So versus our original expectations for this year, if you just go back to the beginning of the year, as we've been giving you an outlook each quarter, the place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first half of the year, we had the tremendous SG&A savings. But then in the back half, we made some investments. So while the SG&A was certainly a highlight, and year-over-year, certainly a huge driver of our year-over-year improvement, the place where we really made more progress than we expected was in our gross profit. Two drivers of that. One is the investments that we've made. One came from some of the SG&A we invested, of course, which was in this pricing and promotional capability and some of the decisions that we made around that. The other thing in Q4 that we would attribute our success to was a highly disciplined marketing plan to back up the merchandising. Clearly, the merchandise assortment was very strong in Q4. And then that was, of course, supported by the marketing, which was extremely targeted, focused and effective. We told you guys that the year prior that this was an area we had to work on. There was great emphasis put in that area. But in the end, the other place where we saw an exceptional outcome was merchandising, inventory. There was a lot of drama in Q4, port strikes, various things. One of the core competencies at Best Buy is inventory management. And obviously, our positioning from a merchandising point of view with the vendors also contributed. There were some great products. And Best Buy had the great products. So it was a combination of a lot of things. But when you look at the P&L and you want to put it down on a piece of paper, it was really the top line and the gross profit improvements that we've been able to drive."

And thank you for your kind comments. Services is really, you could say, 2 major components: one is the extended warranties, which is more an insurance business or an assurance business; and two, services that help customers take advantage of implements with these toys that we sell them. We see enormous opportunities there. When you step back, the technology that's available today is more complex, richer than it's ever been and there's a growing gap between what these technologies, these products can do and the understanding of customers about the possibilities. Also it's increasingly connected. Think about it 15 years ago. That's a long time ago. In our homes, we had a personal computer, maybe connected to a printer and a fax line with dial-up service, and then we had a CRT TV, some audio equipment. Now everything is connected. You have multiple networks in your house, and it's complex. And it's complex to implement. It's complex to support. It's complex to take advantage of. So we see enormous opportunities to help customers in this area as part of our strategy to grow in the various categories we've talked about. And we're uniquely positioned there because there's only so much you can -- I mean, there's a lot we can do remotely. And today, we can troubleshoot your computer remotely using online tools. But there's a limit to this. And we have this gift, which is we have these 20,000 people, Geek Squad agents of the company, including those who are get into people's homes and to support and set up a network and everything that goes around it, that's a very unique capability. So I think that's going to be the core theme. So there's going to be work on making sure that the excellent warranty and product-specific services are highly competitive and are effectively marketed and promoted and sold. And then there's building, you could say, this professional services offering and set of capabilities to help our customers."

So that's kind of an indication because that was a potential impact of about $350 million. We have made substantial progress in this area. And we've made about as much progress as we can make without major structural changes to our systems and our capabilities of being able to show that product in the online channel. So that's the structural investments that we're making this year in order to take that initiative to the next level. So you are seeing it. Your recollection of the things we've said is absolutely correct. And we expect to see more going into 2016. As you know, we did bring up that product on the website. It's harder to find than we would like it to be because of the way our impact and inventory system come together.

Pricing and promotion, of course, is a science, where tools and science and experience are really important. And last year, we invested in teams and tools and capabilities that allowed us to have better information. Also I think that our team probably used more wisdom as well. It's a combination, right? To illustrate the point, in some cases, you may have a particular competitor that has a certain product with limited quantities and a price set up to or a promotion set up to drive traffic to their outlets. In some cases, it may make sense for us to match. In other cases, it may not make sense to match when we have much bigger quantities and they have very limited capabilities. So I would say the way we manage competitive reaction this year with the help of this additional science was very helpful. So I was very proud of our team there. And combined with a very strong assortment and marketing also give us more confidence to execute. Retail is really about execution. And given the ability of our teams to execute in an orderly fashion was, I think, a very important point of our holiday. So I hope these comments are helpful. Thank you so much. And in closing, earlier on the call, I thanked our teams at Best Buy for delivering these great results. In closing, I'd like to, of course, thank our shareholders for your support and the confidence you're placing in us.

In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by The NPD Group, includes: TVs; desktop and notebook computers; tablets, not including Kindle; digital imaging and other categories.
Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenues. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, Appliances or Services. During the quarter, as announced on March 28, the company consolidated the Future Shop and Best Buy brands in Canada under the Best Buy brand. The consolidation is expected to have a material impact on all of our Canadian retail stores and websites on a year-over-year basis. As such, all Canadian revenue has been removed from the comparable sales base, and International no longer has a comparable metric. Therefore, enterprise comparable sales will be equal to Domestic comparable sales until International revenue is again comparable on a year-over-year basis.

I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter results, and I will then provide highlights of the progress we've made in our fiscal 2016 priorities and then turn the call ove",1628,"Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter results, and I will then provide highlights of the progress we've made in our fiscal 2016 priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion, in addition to our non-GAAP operating income rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS, all exceeded our expectations during the quarter due to a stronger-than-expected performance in the Domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.6% was flat to last year, including approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 was up 6%. 
In the Domestic business against a backdrop where the NPD-reported consumer electronics categories, which represent approximately 65% of our revenue, were down 5.3%. Our comparable sales and contracts, excluding the impact of installment bidding, declined only 0.7% as we continue to take advantage of strong product cycles in large-screen televisions and iconic mobile phones and continued growth in the major appliance category. 
Offsetting these positive trends was continued industry softness in other categories, most notably in tablets and computing, where we have significant market share. For NPD, the tablet category declined yearly 30%, similar to last quarter, and computing declined high single digits versus low single digits last quarter. 
Throughout the quarter, our strategy of delivering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" continue to resonate with our customers. While merchandising, marketing and operational execution were the technical drivers of our better-than-expected first quarter financial results, strategically, we believe the cumulative impact of the progress we have made to improve our multi-channel customer experience is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market. We've made real progress, and it is showing in our results. 
Therefore, I want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering this progress and these results. All of us know that we have significant opportunities and work ahead of us. 
Thus, we continue to invest in the first quarter in the fiscal 2016 growth initiatives that we outlined in March. While these investments did and will continue to put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe they are imperative to driving future growth and improving our customer experience at every touch point. 
Today, we interact with customers in 3 distinct and complementary channels: online, in-store, and in-home. We believe our ability to do this, particularly in-home, is a strategic competitive advantage that, with these investments, will further differentiate Best Buy from the competition and allow us to deliver uniquely personalized experience to our customers where, when and how they want to be served. 
As we invest, we will keep the obsessive focus on the customer experience that forms the core of our strategy. We operate in a retail world where good service is expected. Therefore, we have to continue to identify and eliminate customer pain points as quickly as possible and continue to focus on building uniquely engaging customer experiences that will be the basis of stronger long-term customer loyalty. 
I will now provide highlights of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2016 priorities, including our growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services. 
So first from a merchandising standpoint, in Appliances, we rolled out 11 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year. We also continue to invest in our fixed infrastructure to support the scaling of our Appliance business as industry competition continues to provide opportunities to gain share. While these are multiyear investments, we do expect to see gradual and incremental improvements over time. 
In fact, in the first quarter, we saw early progress in improving our Net Promoter Score in Appliance delivery and installation. 
In mobile phones, we extended our mobile phone installment billing's selling capability online with AT&T and plan to roll out other carriers this summer. At this time, we are the only noncarrier retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store, and we believe this is a critical capability as consumer demand for installment billing continues to accelerate. 
We also continue to build out our key life event program. Of course, it is still very early for our newly launched wedding and gift registry, but we continue to see our new program drive significant revenue growth, particularly in televisions. 
We also launched an improved version of our multi-channel gift center to deliver a better customer experience that -- by significantly expanding the curated products to include more price points and more occasions. This was accomplished by supporting both Canada-based events like holidays as well as using our Athena customer database to capitalize on other key events such as birthdays and anniversaries. 
I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. With such a significant and fast-growing traffic now coming from mobile devices, it is imperative that we accelerate in the transformation of our mobile customer experience, and so I'm pleased to say that in the first quarter, we launched our new mobile app. The new app, which includes the acceptance of Apple Pay, has received strong customer reviews. 
During the quarter, we also launched new search capabilities that improve the online visibility of returned open-box inventory. While there are more capabilities being implemented this year to improve recovery of our return, replace and damage inventory, to date, we have made it much easier for customers to find, view and shop open-box products by adding the relevant information and links to the product listing pages and search results. 
Lastly, we began recruiting for our new technology development center in Seattle, which we believe will be instrumental in continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and mobile customer experience. 
Turning to Services. We envision Services playing 3 important roles: number one, to be a differentiator by offering a unique service as part of the product purchase; number two, to be a business driver contributing to product sales and a strong customer relationship; and three, to be a profit center in its own right. 
We view Services as a source of strategic competitive advantage based on our ability to provide these Services online, in-store and in the customer's homes through our own system designers and Geek Squad agents. We are encouraged by the early progress we have been making. For example, we're seeing strong and improving NPS scores across our service portfolio. We're also getting a positive customer response from our in-home consultations and Services provided by our Magnolia Design Centers and the classes we began offering in some of our stores. 
We also know that we are in the midst of a multiyear transformation of our Services activities that entail significant work around our service offerings, capabilities, processes, tools and systems across all customer touch points. 
Of course, as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on reducing costs and driving operational efficiencies to fund investments in our future. Therefore, as we announced last quarter, we're continuing to aggressively pursue the benefits from the second phase of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, and I'm encouraged by our early work. 
As a reminder, our Phase 2 target is approximately $400 million over the next 3 years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunities. These savings are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 due to the structural nature and the time it will take to develop systems to capture the opportunities. 
These savings will be partially offset, however, by the incremental investments we're making in our future growth initiatives, which for this year, we expect to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $30 million or $0.05 of diluted EPS to fund these initiatives. 
Turning to our International business. We're aiming to strengthen our long-term position in Canada as the leading provider of consumer electronics products, Services and solutions by consolidating our Future Shop brand into the Best Buy brand. This plan includes permanently closing 66 Future Shop locations, which we did in March and converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations and Future Shop website to the Best Buy brand. With these store closures, the company now has a total of 192 locations across Canada, including 136 large-format stores and 56 Best Buy Mobile stores. 
This plan also includes building a leading multi-channel customer experience, which replicates successful aspects of our Domestic Renew Blue strategy, including launching major Appliances in all stores; working with our vendor partners to bring their products to life in a more compelling way; increasing our staffing levels to better serve our customers; and investing in the online shopping experience, including expanding our in-store pickup areas, launching ship-from-store and introducing the marketplace program. 
To deliver this leading multi-channel experience as we've previously discussed, we're projecting to invest up to $560 million in capital over the next 2 years. 
So in summary, while the consumer electronics industry is subject to product cycles, we are excited about the role that technology plays in people's lives and the opportunities that this creates. We are also confident that we're executing against the right investment strategy that will allow us to capitalize on key technology waves and customer experience opportunities to build sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our first quarter financials and our financial outlook."

Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expectations due to stronger-than-expected growth in our Domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded our expectations by 30 to 50 basis points due to a mix shift to higher-margin computing hardware and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio, again in our Domestic business. 
I will now like to talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 0.9% to $8.6 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.02 to $0.37, driven primarily by lower net interest expense and a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate due to a discrete income tax benefit in the quarter. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.4% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by an estimated 130 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a $40 million or 50 basis point improvement in the performance of our Credit Card portfolio, partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 0.7%, including installment billing. 
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 5.3%, primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue also increased 30 basis points to 8.5% versus 8.2% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 29.2%, this year's online growth rate of 5.3% was primarily due to the expected 1,000 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming comparable introductions and the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store as well as the industry softness in tablet and computing, which represents a large percentage of our online revenue. 
We do expect the online growth rate to continue to be lower than last year's growth rate in Q2 due to again lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in television, mobile phones and major Appliances was more than offset by declines in tablets and computing. We also saw a comparable sales decline in Services. This decline of 10.3% was primarily driven, though, by the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plan, which resulted in lower claims frequency and operational positives and lower extended warranty attach rates. 
In our International segment, revenue declined 22.1% to $668 million due to a negative foreign currency impact of 1,000 basis points, the loss of revenue from 1 month of the Canadian brand consolidation and ongoing softness in the Canadian consumer electronics industry. 
Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the first quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% last year, an increase of 10 basis points. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 20 basis points to 22.9% versus 22.7% last year. This increase was primarily due to a 40 basis point benefit from our Credit Card portfolio, a positive mix shift to higher-margin computing hardware and additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower COGS due to lower claim frequency. 
These increases were partially offset by increasing inventory reserves on non-iconic phone inventory due to declining inventory valuation and a negative mix shift into certain lower-margin iconic phones. 
The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 100 basis points to 22.8% to versus 23.8% last year. This decline was primarily due to the disruptive impact from the Canadian brand consolidation and increased commercial activity in Canada. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue versus 20.2% last year, a dollar decrease of $5 million, but a rate increase of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus 19.6% last year, an increase of $35 million or 20 basis points, primarily driven by approximately 35 basis points of increased cost to support our investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. 
These increases were partially offset by the realization of last year's annualized Renew Blue cost-reduction initiatives and a discrete benefit from an operating tax settlement. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $179 million or 26.8% of revenue versus 25.5% of revenue last year, a decrease of $40 million. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rate and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. From a rate perspective, the 130 basis point rate increase is driven by year-over-year sales de-leverage. 
For the balance of the year, as we announced in March, we are continuing to project a non-GAAP diluted EPS impact from the Canadian brand consolidation in the range of negative $0.10 to $0.20 due to lost revenue from the closed stores, disruption to the rebranded stores and higher SG&A due to the short-term investments we are making to maximize customer retention from the closed stores. 
This non-GAAP diluted EPS impact, which was minimal in the first quarter due to just 1 month of disruption, is expected to be fully incurred in fiscal '16. The top line negative impact from the store closings net of customer retention rates, however, is expected to continue long term. Ultimately, we expect the Canadian business to be more vibrant and more profitable with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This outlook is based on the following assumptions: number one, in the Domestic business, a flat to positive low single-digit revenue growth rate; two, higher year-over-year non-GAAP Domestic SG&A dollars due to increased investment in future growth initiatives and SG&A inflation; three, in International, a revenue decline of 30% to 35% due to store closures and overall disruption from the Canadian brand consolidation in addition to the ongoing negative impact of foreign exchange rates; and four, an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 3.5% to negative 5%, reflecting the near-term impact of the Canadian brand consolidation that we've already discussed. 
With these assumptions, our enterprise outlook for second quarter includes a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a year-over-year non-GAAP operating income rate decline in the range of negative 30 to 50 basis points, which is in line with our previous outlook. This revised outlook, however, now assumes a strengthening in our Domestic business versus the previous outlook, offset by the near-term impact of the Canadian brand consolidation. 
Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 40%. While underlying this outlook is a cautious view on the NPD consumer electronics categories overall, we are encouraged by the strong product cycles and large-screen high-definition television, where we have a high market share and our momentum in the growing categories like mobile phones and Appliances, where we have a relatively low market share. So with these opportunities and our track record in outperforming the NPD categories, we are confident in our ability to execute against the outlook we provided today. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

The 5.3% decline we call out pertains to the NPD-tracked categories, which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included in there, in particular phones and Appliances as well as gaming and entertainment. As you would know, phones and Appliances are growing categories. Now there's not immediately available precise information on these categories. But if you look around, you will assume that phones and Appliances in particular are growing nicely. So I would not conclude even though we don't have precise facts for the quarter, I would not conclude that the industry as a whole is down by that much, okay? So that's the first. I think it's really important to understand from an investment thesis standpoint, the industry is not down 5%, okay? Now hard to track exactly the number, but it's not down 5%. Now talking about categories we're excited about into the future, I think we've been consistent in saying, in fact, in particular that phones and Appliances were a key area of focus for us. These are large markets that are growing, where our market share is low. So that's a significant area of focus as we talk about and very familiar with some of the investments we're making with call them out on the call. The area of Connected Home is also an area of intense focus from a strategic standpoint, and it's not just the lighting or the locks. It's the fact that all of our homes are connected today right compared to remember a few years ago, you had a PC, you had a CRT TV and a nice stereo system. Now everything is connected, which provides opportunities for us. There's a gap between what customers understand they can do with technology and what technology can do. So we are there to close these gaps. So we think about these ways of technology, and I've given you 2 or 3 areas of intensive interest. As relates to efficiencies, I think our entire strategy since day 1 of Renew Blue has been a balanced view between cost and revenue between the customers and the efficiencies, which is why we have this second phase of Renew Blue cost take out as we quantified at $400 million. As a management team, we're as intensively focused on that second phase as we were on the first phase. It's different in nature though. So it's more within really to eliminating waste, driving efficiencies in our processes. So it goes after more structural systems driven improvements, which is why we've indicated that we would take effect -- start seeing the results in the next few quarters as opposed to the first half of the year, but we're not betting on the market to, all of a sudden, becoming a rising sea to go after these efficiency. It's a dual-track strategy."

The market is actually not up in the quarter. It had been up in Q4. It's not up in Q1. However, you have something that is going on, which is a genuine customer interest for larger-screen televisions, and in particular as the quality of the pictures has improved and partly that's driven by 4K. Large-screen television is actually very appealing, given a set number of pixels. And so what you're seeing is this wave in the large-screen television. What you're also seen for us and let me emphasize this because it's something that we control, the work that our teams, our merchandising team has done in the stores in particular to showcase the latest TVs is quite extraordinary. As you know, we've done that in partnership with some of our key vendors in the stores, so Sony and Samsung in particular with a pretty dramatic exposition of the TVs as well as investments in expert labor. So there's more knowledgeable labor. So for these new TVs, I'm going to be judge and jury, we're the destinations for both and the better customer experience is really driving the market, the material market share gain for us. Now looking ahead at holiday, I think the one piece of uncertainty is going to be what the average selling prices are going to do in the back half as relates to these TVs. So there's no doubt that the customer interest will continue, but the average selling price, of course, in our industry has been big impact on our top line. How much deflation we will get, I think it's anybody's -- it's a at this point in time. These are some of the key mechanics of what we're seeing."

Hubert talked a lot about it in his prepared remarks, and we clearly recognize that when somebody's in a Best Buy store and they are looking to invest in this type of technology, which is complex technology, that we have a service offering that is not available across the landscape of retail, and it makes a significant difference when you are changing technologies like this.

So what we did this year -- that was the transition period of the credit card. So this year, we are obviously coming into a place where we are much more stable in the projections around the credit card, and all transition, for the most part, is gone. We are benefiting in the Credit Card portfolio right now by a very strong backdrop, which I would call the economy, which, of course, gets around your loss ratios and other things in the credit card, not to mention the fact that we're executing well at retail in building our portfolio. So it is a combination of 2 things. But the place, Matt, where we will be cautious or it's not cautious, it is a macro situation that we have to recognize is that the economy is tracking along. At any point, there can be moments in the economy, both positive and negative, but the negative ones are going to probably impact your loss ratios. We intend to operate at a very high credit score. So it's going to be less impactful to us initially, but that is the nature of the private, these co-brand and private label Credit Card portfolio. So at this point, we felt like Q1 was a very strong quarter. We're may be getting a little bit of residual off of the previous agreement, which could potentially not continue, but as far as drama goes around the credit card, it's been great. We don't have anything to talk about."

And because remember last year, we were investing each quarter, measuring and then continuing. So it accumulates, and then, of course, it comes whatever we did in Q3 and Q4 of last year, I discussed in Q1. So absolutely, invested in price. On the phone reserve, it's very simple. There are some very strong phones in the market, and then there are other inventories that you may have whether they are new or open box. And these inventories because of installment billing, a customer buying a used phone or a new phone or a higher-priced phone, the monthly charge of that is quite small, the difference. So I can buy a more expensive phone without a lot of financial impact to myself through installment billing. So it takes the valuation on some of the less iconic phones, and it impairs them. And I think that the great news is that we are so strong in the iconic ones that we saw this incredible performance of mobile, and the other side of that is driven by that is this what happens to the other phones when that occurs. So we do not see this as a long-term issue or something that's going to continue each quarter, but it is associated with the other side of our performance, which was a very overall, including this reserve, strong performance in mobile."

So we're not going to be -- we're not guiding individual line items. And depending on how you're modeling, you could potentially come into a margin within a fairly wide range based on the guidance that we gave you. Again, what we're anticipating, of course, is that we're going to see positive revenue. And when we see that, depending on the mix of that revenue, we'll see how that plays out. It gets into some of the discussion that we had about this increase in volume. In some of these categories, you're seeing declining ASPs, but you're going to see more volume. We're expecting to see a strong -- remember, what we said strong product cycle in television? So that is a possibility, but I think that when we look at our business, it is difficult by line item to give future outlook. From an execution point of view, obviously, we do feel like we are going to have a solid outcome. Now remember on the OI rate, we are making -- Q2 is going to be one of our big quarters of our investments in our growth initiative. Across the board in just about every one that we laid out, there is a layering in of expense in the second quarter. So on the SG&A side, while you may see it in gross profit and the way you've modeled, I would tell you that on the SG&A side is where we actually are anticipating to see much more pressure. So gross profit is interesting. But actually, the place where the Q2, and this started -- we talked about this even last quarter. It hasn't changed. What did change as far as those investments went, what did change is the fact that we're going to have higher revenue in the Domestic business, which gives us certainly more leverage of those investments in Q2. So that was a little circular way. You asked me a specific question, I had to go to the SG&A because in your modeling, you're looking at a gross profit, but it's really SG&A."

So as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've closed the stores that we were going to close. We've also closed the Future Shop site. The Best Buy stores are doing great. There's a lot of momentum there. The remaining Future Shop stores, the 65 open that are converting to Best Buy are very much in a period of transition, very important to understand. If you go to Toronto or Vancouver, you're going to be surprised because you're going to see Future Shop stores that are operating with sales associates wearing a blue T-shirt, and so that's a bit confusing for the customer. So let me describe now what's ahead of us. What's ahead of us over this summer, we're going to re-sign, if you will, or change the signage and really convert the Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores. So by the end of this summer, they will look like Best Buy stores, and that's going to take the next 3 months. The other thing that we're very excited about well, let me first say I'm very proud of one thing, which is how our Canadian team has remained extremely focused on serving the customers during that period of time. So I have to salute them there. What we are excited about is the work that the team started to do after we announced this because remember that before the announcement, this was a fairly closely held decision. So they started to work. We started to work with our vendor partners in Canada, and we started to work on the design of the stores of the future, if I can call them that. Very encouraged by the reaction from the vendor community that see the change was made as a material opportunity because it gives them the opportunity to invest in fewer stores and make them great, which is the essence of this transition to multi-channel. When you go to the store, the customer experience needs to be amazing. So the teams are working on this design. Later this year, we will implement in a few stores. We're still defining exactly how many, but it's likely to be a handful roughly speaking of stores that are going to be representative of what the stores are going to look like in the future. In these stores, there will be disruptions because it's a complete revamp of the store, and we'll see how it does during holiday. And next year, we will expand that to the remainder of the chain. So this is really next year after we've done the conversions and the investments that we'll have a good sense of what the ongoing retention will be. So far, we're pleased by what we're seeing, but I don't think it's meaningful, right? As the essential idea was not simply to close stores because the customers -- you're not doing anything for the customer, but to reinvent the customer experience as we move forward. And I think what we're going to see is going to be exciting, but it's going to be a journey as many things. Sharon, about the $0.10 to $0.20?"

In Q2, you're going to see obviously a bigger impact than Q1. Remember, we only had 1 month in Q1. So I think I've actually given you specific OI rate guidance for Q2. So there's no mystery in what Q2 is. Last year, the International rate was a negative 3. They're coming up against a very weak quarter last year. So the impact doesn't look as big in Q2. But if you got to the high -- the low end of the range that I provided on the outlook, which was a negative 5% for Canada, that would be looking something like a $0.01 or so of negative impact to the EPS. And then in Q3, it's going to get bigger, and the largest piece of it is going to come in Q4. You've got to remember that in Canada historically, their jump from Q2 to Q3 on revenue if you just look at the International segment is much bigger than the way the U.S. jumped from Q2 to Q3, and then it jumps again from Q3 to Q4. So that's how we should be modeling your impact as you look there. And then in Q3 as Hubert mentioned, all the work that we will be able to get done this year we will, of course, do before we go into holiday. So Q3 gets some pressure from that as well."

As relates to the U.S., the situation -- I would say 2 things. We always said that we would, on an ongoing basis, optimize our store footprint. So I will reiterate that. This said, the situation in Canada is completely different from the U.S. In Canada, the store footprint was driven by these 2 brands. So again for those of us who have been to Canada, we have seen these parking lots where you have the Best Buy store and in the same parking lot quite often, a Future Shop store. So that's a gift from heaven, right? Because the retention there is going to be quite extraordinary if we managed to create something great for the customers in the remaining stores. The configuration of the store footprint in the U.S. has nothing to do with that because we've always had only one brand. And so it's not the same kind of opportunity. What we saw in Canada or what our Canadian team saw is the fact that, as many of you will have guessed, consolidating the 2 brands was the right thing to do and was going to unlock the opportunity to save on SG&A and be able to invest with our vendor partners strategically in the remaining stores. Different situation in the U.S. This said, of course, we will look. We're always learning. So we look at what we can learn from the Canadian experience, but the translation is not going to be immediate, I want to be very clear about that."

So there's a process redesign work going on, both impacting the online buying experience as well as the in-store buying experience because everything needs to go well at every step in the process. So that's an example of fixing pain points. On the flip side, an example of providing an inspiring customer experience, which is the -- increasingly, we're going to spend time more on the latter, I would highlight a couple of things that we are excited about and that I briefly mentioned, which is the in-home consultations provided today in particular by our Magnolia teams, and that would apply to probably everyone on the phone.

Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.
During the quarter, as announced on March 28, the company consolidated the Future Shop and Best Buy brands in Canada under the Best Buy brand. The consolidation is expected to have a material impact on all of our Canadian retail stores and websites on a year-over-year basis. As such, all Canadian revenue has been removed from the comparable sales base, and International no longer has a comparable metric. Therefore, Enterprise comparable sales will be equal to Domestic comparable sales until International revenue is again comparable on a year-over-year basis.

So first, our financial results. Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion, in addition to our non-GAAP operating income rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS, all exceeded our expectations during the quarter due to a stronger-than-expected performance in the Domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.6% was flat to last year, including approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 was up 6%.
In the Domestic business, against a backdrop where the NPD-reported consumer electronics categories, which represent approximately 65% of our revenue, were down 5.3%, our comparable sales and contracts, excluding the impact of installment bidding, declined only 0.7% as we continued to take advantage of strong product cycles in large-screen televisions and iconic mobile phones and continued growth in the major appliance category.
Offsetting these positive trends was continued industry softness in other categories, most notably in tablets and computing where we have significant market share. Per NPD, the tablet category declined nearly 30%, similar to last quarter, and computing declined high single digits versus low single digits last quarter.
Throughout the quarter, our strategy of delivering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" continued to resonate with our customers. While merchandising, marketing and operational execution were the tactical drivers of our better-than-expected first quarter financial results, strategically, we believe the cumulative impact of the progress we have made to improve our multi-channel customer experience is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market. We've made real progress, and it is showing in our results.
I therefore want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering this progress and these results. All of us know that we have significant opportunities and work ahead of us.
Thus, we continue to invest in the first quarter in the fiscal 2016 growth initiatives that we outlined in March. While these investments did and will continue to put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe they are imperative to driving future growth and improving our customer experience at every touch point.
Today, we interact with customers in 3 distinct and complementary channels: online, in-stores and in-home. We believe our ability to do this, particularly in-home, is a strategic competitive advantage that, with these investments, will further differentiate Best Buy from the competition and allow us to deliver uniquely personalized experience to our customers where, when and how they want to be served.
As we invest, we will keep the obsessive focus on the customer experience that forms the core of our strategy. We operate in a retail world where good service is expected. Therefore, we have to continue to identify and eliminate customer pain points as quickly as possible and in parallel, continue to focus on building uniquely engaging customer experiences that will be the basis of stronger long-term customer loyalty.
I will now provide highlights of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2016 priorities, including our growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services.
So first, from a merchandising standpoint, in appliances, we rolled out 11 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year. We also continue to invest in our fixed infrastructure to support the scaling of our appliance business as industry competition continues to provide opportunities to gain share. While these are multiyear investments, we do expect to see gradual and incremental improvements over time. In fact, in the first quarter, we saw early progress in improving our Net Promoter Score in appliance delivery and installation.
In mobile phones, we extended our mobile phone installment billing's selling capability online with AT&T and plan to roll out other carriers this summer. At this time, we are the only noncarrier retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store, and we believe this is a critical capability as consumer demand for installment billing continues to accelerate.
We also continue to build out our key life event program. Of course, it is still very early for our newly launched wedding and gift registry, but we're continuing to see our new moving [ph] program drive significant revenue growth, particularly in televisions.
We also launched an improved version of our multi-channel gift center to deliver a better customer experience that -- by significantly expanding the curated products to include more price points and more occasions. This was accomplished by supporting both Canada-based events like holidays as well as using our Athena customer database to capitalize on other key events such as birthdays and anniversaries.
I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. With such a significant and fast-growing portion of our traffic now coming from mobile devices, it is imperative that we accelerate the transformation of our mobile customer experience. And so I'm pleased to say that in the first quarter, we launched our new mobile app. The new app, which includes the acceptance of Apple Pay, has received strong customer reviews.
During the quarter, we also launched new search capabilities that improve the online visibility of returned open-box inventory. While there are more capabilities being implemented this year to improve recovery of our return, replace and damage inventory, to date, we've made it much easier for customers to find, view and shop open-box products by adding the relevant information and links to the product listing pages and search results.
Lastly, we began recruiting for our new technology development center in Seattle, which we believe will be instrumental in continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and mobile customer experience.
Turning to services. We envision services playing 3 important roles: Number one, to be a differentiator by offering a unique service as part of the product purchase; number two, to be a business driver contributing to product sales and a stronger customer relationship; and three, to be a profit center in its own right.
We view services as a source of strategic competitive advantage based on our ability to provide these services online, in-store and in the customers' homes through our own system designers and Geek Squad agents. We are encouraged by the early progress we have been making. For example, we're seeing strong and improving NPS scores across our service portfolio. We're also getting a positive customer response from our in-home consultations and services provided by our Magnolia Design Centers and the classes we began offering in some of our stores.
We also know that we are in the midst of a multiyear transformation of our services activities that entail significant work around our service offerings, capabilities, processes, tools and systems across all customer touch points.
Of course, as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on reducing costs and driving operational efficiencies to fund investments in our future. Therefore, as we announced last quarter, we're continuing to aggressively pursue the benefits from the second phase of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, and I'm encouraged by our early work.
As a reminder, our Phase 2 target is approximately $400 million over the next 3 years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunities. These savings are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 due to the structural nature and the time it will take to develop systems to capture the opportunities.
These savings will be partially offset, however, by the incremental investments we're making in our future growth initiatives, which, for this year, we expect to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $30 million or $0.05 of diluted EPS to fund these initiatives.
Turning to our International business. We're aiming to strengthen our long-term position in Canada as the leading provider of consumer electronics products, services and solutions by consolidating our Future Shop brand into the Best Buy brand. This plan includes permanently closing 66 Future Shop locations, which we did in March, and converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations and Future Shop website to the Best Buy brand. With these store closures, the company now has a total of 192 locations across Canada, including 136 large-format stores and 56 Best Buy mobile stores.
This plan also includes building a leading multi-channel customer experience, which replicates successful aspects of our domestic Renew Blue strategy, including launching major appliances in all stores; working with our vendor partners to bring their products to life in a more compelling way; increasing our staffing levels to better serve our customers; and investing in the online shopping experience, including expanding our in-store pickup areas, launching ship-from-store, introducing the marketplace program.
To deliver this leading multi-channel experience as we've previously discussed, we're projecting to invest up to $560 million in capital over the next 2 years.
So in summary, while the consumer electronics industry is subject to product cycles, we are excited about the role that technology plays in people's lives and the opportunities that this creates. We are also confident that we're executing against the right investment strategy that will allow us to capitalize on key technology waves and customer experience opportunities to build sustainable long-term shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our first quarter financials and our financial outlook."
255397,296208173,820775,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 21, 2015",2015-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.Our Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expect",1221,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.
Our Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expectations due to stronger-than-expected growth in our Domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded our expectations by 30 to 50 basis points due to a mix shift to higher-margin computing hardware and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio, again, in our Domestic business.
I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 0.9% to $8.6 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.02 to $0.37, driven primarily by lower net interest expense and a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate due to a discrete income tax benefit in the quarter.
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.4% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by an estimated 130 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a $40 million or 50 basis point improvement in the performance of our credit card portfolio, partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 0.7%, including installment billing.
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 5.3%, primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue also increased 30 basis points to 8.5% versus 8.2% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 29.2%, this year's online growth rate of 5.3% was primarily due to the expected 1,000 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming comparable introductions and the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store as well as the industry softness in tablets and computing, which represent a large percentage of our online revenue.
We do expect the online growth rate to continue to be lower than last year's growth rate in Q2 due to, again, lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year.
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in television, mobile phones and major appliances was more than offset by declines in tablets and computing. We also saw a comparable sales decline in services. This decline of 10.3% was primarily driven, though, by the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower claim frequency and operational positive and lower extended warranty attach rates.
In our International segment, revenue declined 22.1% to $668 million due to a negative foreign currency impact of 1,000 basis points, the loss of revenue from 1 month of the Canadian brand consolidation and ongoing softness in the Canadian consumer electronics industry.
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the first quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% last year, an increase of 10 basis points. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 20 basis points to 22.9% versus 22.7% last year. This increase was primarily due to a 40 basis point benefit from our credit card portfolio, a positive mix shift to higher-margin computing hardware and additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency.
These increases were partially offset by increasing inventory reserves on non-iconic phone inventory due to declining inventory valuation and a negative mix shift into certain lower-margin iconic phones.
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 100 basis points to 22.8% versus 23.8% last year. This decline was primarily due to the disruptive impact from the Canadian brand consolidation and increased commercial activity in Canada.
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue versus 20.2% last year, a dollar decrease of $5 million but a rate increase of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus 19.6% last year, an increase of $35 million or 20 basis points, primarily driven by approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation.
These increases were partially offset by the realization of last year's annualized Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and a discrete benefit from an operating tax settlement.
International non-GAAP SG&A was $179 million or 26.8% of revenue versus 25.5% of revenue last year, a decrease of $40 million. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rate and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. From a rate perspective, the 130 basis point rate increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.
For the balance of the year, as we announced in March, we are continuing to project a non-GAAP diluted EPS impact from the Canadian brand consolidation in the range of negative $0.10 to $0.20 due to lost revenue from the closed stores, disruption to the rebranded stores and higher SG&A due to the short-term investments we are making to maximize customer retention from the closed stores.
This non-GAAP diluted EPS impact, which was minimal in the first quarter due to just 1 month of disruption, is expected to be fully incurred in fiscal '16. The top line negative impact from the store closings net of customer retention rates, however, is expected to continue long term. Ultimately, we expect the Canadian business to be more vibrant and more profitable, with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate.
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This outlook is based on the following assumptions: Number one, in the Domestic business, a flat to positive low single-digit revenue growth rate; two, higher year-over-year non-GAAP Domestic SG&A dollars due to increased investments in future growth initiatives and SG&A inflation; three, in International, a revenue decline of 30% to 35% due to store closures and overall disruption from the Canadian brand consolidation in addition to the ongoing negative impact of foreign exchange rates; and four, an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 3.5% to negative 5%, reflecting the near-term impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation that we've already discussed.
With these assumptions, our Enterprise outlook for second quarter includes a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a year-over-year non-GAAP operating income rate decline in the range of negative 30 to 50 basis points, which is in line with our previous outlook. This revised outlook, however, now assumes a strengthening in our Domestic business versus the previous outlook, offset by the near-term impact of the Canadian brand consolidation. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 40%.
While underlying this outlook is a cautious view on the NPD consumer electronics categories overall, we are encouraged by the strong product cycles in large-screen, high-definition televisions, where we have a high market share, and our momentum in the growing categories like mobile phones and appliances, where we have a relatively low market share. So with these opportunities and our track record in outperforming the NPD categories, we are confident in our ability to execute against the outlook we provided today.
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

The 5.3% decline we called out pertains to the NPD-tracked categories, which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included",495,"Yes. So we need to be very clear. The 5.3% decline we called out pertains to the NPD-tracked categories, which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included in there, in particular phones and appliances as well as gaming and entertainment. As you would know, phones and appliances are growing categories. Now there's not immediately available precise information on these categories. But if you look around, you will assume that phones and appliances, in particular, are growing nicely. So I would not conclude -- even though we don't have precise facts for the quarter, I would not conclude that the industry as a whole is down by that much, okay? So that's the first. I think it's really important to understand from an investment thesis standpoint the industry is not down 5%, okay? Now hard to track exactly the number, but it's not down 5%. Now talking about categories we're excited about into the future, I think we've been consistent in saying, in fact, in particular, that phones and appliances were a key area of focus for us. These are large markets that are growing, where our market share is low. So that's a significant area of focus, as we talked about. And you're very familiar with some of the investments we're making, we'd called them out on the call. The area of Connected Home is also an area of intense focus from a strategic standpoint. And it's not just the lighting or the locks, it's the fact that all of our homes are connected today, right, compared to, remember, a few years ago, you had a PC, you had a CRT TV and a nice stereo system. Now everything is connected, which provides opportunities for us as there's a gap between what customers understand they can do with technology and what technology can do. So we are there to close these gaps. So we think about these waves of technology, and I've given you 2 or 3 areas of intensive interest. As relates to efficiencies, I think our entire strategy since day 1 of Renew Blue has been a balanced view between cost and revenue between the customers and the efficiencies, which is why we have this second phase of Renew Blue cost takeout that we've quantified at $400 million. As a management team, we're as intensively focused on that second phase as we were on the first phase. It's different in nature, though. So it's more leading into eliminating waste, driving efficiencies in our processes. So it goes after more structural systems-driven improvements, which is why we've indicated that they would take effect -- start seeing the results in the next few quarters as opposed during the first half of the year. But we're not betting on the market to all of a sudden becoming a rising sea to go after these efficiencies. This is a dual-track strategy."

The market is actually not up in the quarter. It had been up in Q4. It's not up in Q1. However, you have something that is going on, which is a genuine customer interest for larger-screen televisions, in particular as the quality of the pictures has improved and partly that's driven by 4K. Large-screen television is actually very appealing, given a set number of pixels. And so what you're seeing is this wave in the large-screen television. What you're also seeing for us, and let me emphasize this because that's something we control, the work that our teams, our merchandising team has done in the stores, in particular, to showcase the latest TVs is quite extraordinary. As you know, we've done that in partnership with some of our key vendors in the stores, so Sony and Samsung, in particular, with a pretty dramatic exposition of the TVs as well as investment in expert labor. So there's more knowledgeable labor. And so for these new TVs, I'm going to be judge and jury, but I'm going to say we're the destinations for both, and the better customer experience is really driving the market -- the material market share gain for us. Now looking ahead at holiday, I think the one piece of uncertainty is going to be what the average selling prices are going to do in the back half as it relates to these TVs. So there's no doubt that the customer interest will continue, but the average selling price, of course, in our industry has a big impact on our top line. How much deflation we will get, I think it's anybody's -- it's a bet at this point in time. These are some of the key mechanics of what we are seeing."

So you end up with increased revenue and a slightly lower gross profit rate. That would be how we would see that playing out. And I'll just add to that, that another place where we are, in our minds, clearly being able to inspire the customer and be able to put ourselves in a better position, of course, is from the promise that we can make to the customer on advice, service and convenience. Hubert talked a lot about it in his prepared remarks. And we clearly recognize that when somebody's in a Best Buy store and they are looking to invest in this type of technology, which is complex technology, that we have a service offering that is not available across the landscape of retail, and it makes a significant difference when you are changing technologies like this. So those combined is one of the reasons why we believe that it's a competitive advantage for us to be able to offer this more encompassing experience for the customer."

I just described what we expect around the industry for television going into the back half. We are extremely focused in the back half of the year on executing against the Renew Blue initiatives that we had laid out earlier in the Q4 release and then, of course, the efforts that we have been putting towards our waste efficiency and other types of optimization -- margin optimization initiatives. So we'll give you guys more color. We are very confident as we look toward the back half of the year in what we can execute at Best Buy. We are making a lot of progress on the systems side. You guys are giving us the latitude of being able to make these investments in our future growth initiatives. And as a result of that, we have taken that and run with it. You can see what we have been doing. We actually told you guys we would allow you to track that. We gave you real numbers this quarter around how much we invested in the first quarter in order to be able to drive the type of outcome you would all be looking for in the back half of the year that we're, ourselves, looking for. So we are -- as we go into Q4, everything we are doing right now is to be able to execute another very strong fourth quarter. And again, these cycles are very -- I think are going to be helpful to us. While we don't like where NPD is, we don't sit around internally talking about NPD being down x percent. Our field teams are obsessed with the ability to continue to drive our outcomes that are in our control, not allowing the industry to dictate it. And if you saw the momentum that we're seeing right now in the field, we haven't talked about ISP, our individual sales tracking and the work that we're doing against that. So we have a lot going on right now that we believe is all setting us up to really execute well in Q4. We can't tell you what the industry is going to look like. We can't tell you what -- exactly what products are going to be the big sellers, but what we can tell you is that with the investments we're making and what is happening right now, I call it magic in our stores, we are prepared to execute a really strong Q4."

So it is a combination of 2 things. But the place, Matt, where we will be cautious or we -- it's not cautious, it is a macro situation that we have to recognize is that the economy is tracking along. At any point, there can be moments in the economy, both positive and negative, but the negative ones are going to probably impact your loss ratios. We tend to operate at a very high credit score. So it's going to be less impactful to us initially. But that is the nature of these private -- these co-brand and private-label credit card portfolios.

And because remember, last year, we were investing each quarter, measuring and then continuing, so it accumulates. And then, of course, it comes -- whatever we did in Q3 and Q4 of last year, it hit us in Q1. So absolutely, invested in price. On the phone reserve, it's very simple. There are some very strong phones in the market, and then there are other inventories that you may have, whether they are new or open-box. And these inventories, because of installment billing, a customer buying a used phone or a new phone or a higher-priced phone, the monthly charge of that is quite small, the difference. So I can buy a more expensive phone without a lot of financial impact to myself through installment billing. So it takes the valuation on some of the less iconic phones, and it impairs them. And I think that the great news is that we are so strong in the iconic ones that we saw this incredible performance of mobile. And the other side of that [indiscernible] is driven by that is this what happens to the other phones when that occurs. So we do not see this as a long-term issue or something that's going to continue each quarter, but it is associated with the other side of our performance, which was a very, overall, including this reserve, strong performance in mobile."

And depending on how you're modeling, you could potentially come into a margin within a fairly wide range based on the guidance that we gave you. Again, what we're anticipating, of course, is that we're going to see positive revenue. And when we see that, depending on the mix of that revenue, we'll see how that plays out. It gets into some of the discussion that we had about this increase in volume. In some of these categories, you're seeing declining ASPs, but you're going to see more volume. We're expecting to see a strong -- remember, what we said, strong product cycle in television? So that is a possibility. But I think that when we look at our business, it is difficult by line item to give future outlook. From an execution point of view, obviously, we do feel like we are going to have a solid outcome. Now remember, on the OI rate, we are making -- Q2 is going to be one of our big quarters of our investments in our growth initiatives. Across the board in just about every one that we laid out, there is a layering in of expense in the second quarter. So on the SG&A side, while you may see it in gross profit and the way you've modeled, I would tell you that on the SG&A side is where we actually are anticipating to see much more pressure. So gross profit is interesting. But actually, the place where the Q2 -- and this started -- we talked about this even last quarter, it hasn't changed. What did change -- as far as those investments went, what did change is the fact we're going to have higher revenue in the Domestic business, which gives us certainly more leverage of those investments in Q2. So that was a little circular way. You asked me a specific question, I had to go to the SG&A because in your modeling, you're looking at a gross profit, but it's really SG&A."

Thank you for the opportunity to lay out what's happening in Canada. This was obviously a very significant decision we made. So as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've closed the stores that we were going to close. We've also closed the Future Shop site. The Best Buy stores are doing great. There's a lot of momentum there. The remaining Future Shop stores, the 65 open that are converting to Best Buy, are very much in a period of transition, very important to understand. If you go to Toronto or Vancouver, you're going to be surprised because you're going to see Future Shop stores that are operating with sales associates wearing a blue T-shirt, and so that's a bit confusing for the customer. So let me describe now what's ahead of us. What's ahead of us over this summer, we're going to re-sign, if you will, or change the signage and really convert the Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores. So by the end of the summer, they will look like Best Buy stores, and that's going to take the next 3 months. The other thing that we're very excited about -- well, let me first say, I'm very proud of one thing, which is how our Canadian team has remained extremely focused on serving the customers during that period of time. So I have to salute them there. What we are excited about is the work that the team started to do after we announced because remember that before the announcement, this was a fairly closely held decision. So they started to work. We started to work with our vendor partners in Canada, and we started to work on the design of the stores of the future, if I can call them that. Very encouraged by the reaction from the vendor community that see the change was made as a material opportunity because it gives them the opportunity to invest in fewer stores and make them great, which is the essence of this transition to multi-channel. When you go to the store, the customer experience needs to be amazing. So the teams are working on this design. Later this year, we will implement in a few stores. We're still defining exactly how many, but it's likely to be a handful, roughly speaking, of stores that are going to be representative of what the stores are going to look like in the future. In these stores, there will be disruptions because it's a complete revamp of the store, then we'll see how it does during holiday. And next year, we will expand that to the remainder of the chain. So this is really next year after we've done the conversions and the investments that we'll have a good sense of what the ongoing retention will be. So far, we're pleased by what we're seeing, but I don't think it's meaningful, right, as the essential idea was not simply to close stores because the customers -- you're not doing anything for the customer but to reinvent the customer experience as we move forward. And I think what we're going to see is going to be exciting. But it's going to be a journey as many things we do. Sharon, about the $0.10 to $0.20."

In Q2, you're going to see, obviously, a bigger impact than Q1. Remember, we only had 1 month in Q1. So I think that I've actually given you specific OI rate guidance for Q2. So there's no mystery in what Q2 is. Last year, the International rate was a negative 3%. They're coming up against a very weak quarter last year. So the impact doesn't look as big in Q2. But if you got to the high -- the low end of the range that I provided on the outlook, which was a negative 5% for Canada, that would be looking something like a $0.01 or so of negative impact to the EPS. And then in Q3, it's going to get bigger, and the largest piece of it is going to come in Q4. You got to remember that in Canada historically, their jump from Q2 to Q3 on revenue, if you just look at the International segment, is much bigger than the way the U.S. jumped from Q2 to Q3, and then it jumps again from Q3 to Q4. So that's how you should be modeling your impact as you look there. And then in Q3, as Hubert mentioned, all the work that we will be able to get done this year, we will, of course, do before we go into holiday. So Q3 gets some pressure from that as well."

As it relates to the U.S., the situation -- I would say 2 things. We always said that we would, on an ongoing basis, optimize our store footprint. So I will reiterate that. This said, the situation in Canada is completely different from the U.S. In Canada, the store footprint was driven by these 2 brands. So again, for those of us who have been to Canada, we have seen these parking lots where you have the Best Buy store and in the same parking lot quite often, a Future Shop store. So that's a gift from heaven, right, because the retention there is going to be quite extraordinary if we manage to create something great for the customers in the remaining stores. The configuration of the store footprint in the U.S. has nothing to do with that because we've always had only one brand. And so it's not the same kind of opportunity. What we saw in Canada or what our Canadian team saw is the fact that, as many of you would have guessed, consolidating the 2 brands was the right thing to do and was going to unlock the opportunity to save on SG&A and be able to invest with our vendor partners strategically in the remaining stores. Different situation in the U.S. This said, of course, we will look, we're always learning. So we'll look at what we can learn from the Canadian experience. But the translation is not going to be immediate, I want to be very clear about that."

Thank you for your comments because, indeed, services is a big part of our competitive advantages. One area that I have commented upon is appliance delivery and installation, so big part of our growth strategy. And doing appliance delivery and installation right is not easy. You're talking about moving large SKU, making sure it's not damaged in the process, then delivering it in people's homes. If there is installation work related to gas or electricity or water, getting a licensed professional into people's homes and coordinating the entire process is an area where -- that we identified as a -- candidly as an area of opportunity, where we have high standards at Best Buy, where we want to make this great and a source of differentiation. So there's a process redesign work going on, both impacting the online buying experience as well as the in-store buying experience because everything needs to go well at every step in the process. So that's an example of fixing pain points. On the flip side, an example of providing an inspiring customer experience, which is the -- increasingly, we're going to spend more time on the latter, I would highlight a couple of things that we are excited about and that I briefly mentioned, which is the in-home consultations provided today in particular by our Magnolia teams, and that would apply to probably everyone on the phone. If one day you feel that your network is not functioning properly, and I'm assuming that would be a widespread phenomenon, or if you're asking yourself questions about are your audio or video systems should evolve, we provide the service, we will go to your home, and we'll have a professional that will work with you, understand your situation, your needs and come up with something that is a range of solutions. And when you think about the entire realm around video, around entertainment, around productivity, around your home office, around security, around access to content, there's so many complex areas, and being able to go to your home is something that is very inspiring. Similarly, classes, we've deployed -- we're deploying in a number of our stores camera experience stores, where we have in a hub-and-spoke system a bigger assortment, better staffing, better expertise. We're also doing classes in these camera experience stores. And for those of us who are passionate about photography, this is something that is inspiring increase traffic to the stores with, of course, add-on sales opportunities. So these are the range of examples that we are working on and that can provide opportunities for us.
With this said, I'm looking at the clock. And operator, with your permission, this will be the last question. I want to thank all of you on the call for your continued support, your kind comments this morning. We're working hard on your behalf to continue to deliver great experiences for the customers and great results for our investors. So the journey will continue.

Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.
During the quarter, as announced on March 28, the company consolidated the Future Shop and Best Buy brands in Canada under the Best Buy brand. The consolidation is expected to have a material impact on all of our Canadian retail stores and websites on a year-over-year basis. As such, all Canadian revenue has been removed from the comparable sales base, and International no longer has a comparable metric. Therefore, Enterprise comparable sales will be equal to Domestic comparable sales until International revenue is again comparable on a year-over-year basis.

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter results, and I will then provide highlights of the progress we've made on our fiscal 2016 priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.
So first, our financial results. Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion, in addition to our non-GAAP operating income rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS, all exceeded our expectations during the quarter due to a stronger-than-expected performance in the Domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.6% was flat to last year, including approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 was up 6%.
In the Domestic business, against a backdrop where the NPD-reported consumer electronics categories, which represent approximately 65% of our revenue, were down 5.3%, our comparable sales and contracts, excluding the impact of installment billing, declined only 0.7% as we continued to take advantage of strong product cycles in large-screen televisions and iconic mobile phones and continued growth in the major appliance category.
Offsetting these positive trends was continued industry softness in other categories, most notably in tablets and computing where we have significant market share. Per NPD, the tablet category declined nearly 30%, similar to last quarter, and computing declined high single digits versus low single digits last quarter.
Throughout the quarter, our strategy of delivering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" continued to resonate with our customers. While merchandising, marketing and operational execution were the tactical drivers of our better-than-expected first quarter financial results, strategically, we believe the cumulative impact of the progress we have made to improve our multi-channel customer experience is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market. We've made real progress, and it is showing in our results.
I therefore want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering this progress and these results. All of us know that we have significant opportunities and work ahead of us.
Thus, we continue to invest in the first quarter in the fiscal 2016 growth initiatives that we outlined in March. While these investments did and will continue to put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe they are imperative to driving future growth and improving our customer experience at every touch point.
Today, we interact with customers in 3 distinct and complementary channels: online, in stores and in-home. We believe our ability to do this, particularly in-home, is a strategic competitive advantage that, with these investments, will further differentiate Best Buy from the competition and allow us to deliver a uniquely personalized experience to our customers where, when and how they want to be served.
As we invest, we will keep the obsessive focus on the customer experience that forms the core of our strategy. We operate in a retail world where good service is expected. Therefore, we have to continue to identify and eliminate customer pain points as quickly as possible and, in parallel, continue to focus on building uniquely engaging customer experiences that will be the basis of stronger long-term customer loyalty.
I will now provide highlights of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2016 priorities, including our growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services.
So first, from a merchandising standpoint, in appliances, we rolled out 11 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year. We also continue to invest in our fixed infrastructure to support the scaling of our appliance business as industry competition continues to provide opportunities to gain share. While these are multiyear investments, we do expect to see gradual and incremental improvements over time. In fact, in the first quarter, we saw early progress in improving our Net Promoter Score in appliance delivery and installation.
In mobile phones, we extended our mobile phone installment billing's selling capability online with AT&T and plan to roll out other carriers this summer. At this time, we are the only noncarrier retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store, and we believe this is a critical capability as consumer demand for installment billing continues to accelerate.
We also continue to build out our key life events program. Of course, it is still very early for our newly launched wedding and gift registry, but we're continuing to see our new move -- [ph] program drive significant revenue growth, particularly in televisions.
We also launched an improved version of our multi-channel gift center to deliver a better customer experience that -- by significantly expanding the curated products to include more price points and more occasions. This was accomplished by supporting both Canada-based events like holidays as well as using our Athena customer database to capitalize on other key events such as birthdays and anniversaries.
I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. With such a significant and fast-growing portion of our traffic now coming from mobile devices, it is imperative that we accelerate the transformation of our mobile customer experience. And so I'm pleased to say that in the first quarter, we launched our new mobile app. The new app, which includes the acceptance of Apple Pay, has received strong customer reviews.
During the quarter, we also launched new search capabilities that improve the online visibility of returned open-box inventory. While there are more capabilities being implemented this year to improve recovery of our returned, replaced and damaged inventory, to date, we've made it much easier for customers to find, view and shop open-box products by adding the relevant information and links to the product listing pages and search results.
Lastly, we began recruiting for our new technology development center in Seattle, which we believe will be instrumental in continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and mobile customer experience.
Turning to services. We envision services playing 3 important roles: number one, to be a differentiator by offering a unique service as part of the product purchase; number two, to be a business driver contributing to product sales and a stronger customer relationship; and three, to be a profit center in its own right.
We view services as a source of strategic competitive advantage based on our ability to provide these services online, in-store and in the customers' homes through our own system designers and Geek Squad agents. We are encouraged by the early progress we have been making. For example, we're seeing strong and improving NPS scores across our service portfolio. We're also getting a positive customer response from our in-home consultations and services provided by our Magnolia Design Centers and the classes we've begun offering in some of our stores.
We also know that we are in the midst of a multiyear transformation of our services activities that entail significant work around our service offerings, capabilities, processes, tools and systems across all customer touch points.
Of course, as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on reducing costs and driving operational efficiencies to fund investments in our future. Therefore, as we announced last quarter, we're continuing to aggressively pursue the benefits from the second phase of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, and I'm encouraged by our early work.
As a reminder, our Phase 2 target is approximately $400 million over the next 3 years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunities. These savings are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 due to the structural nature and the time it will take to develop systems to capture the opportunities.
These savings will be partially offset, however, by the incremental investments we're making in our future growth initiatives, which, for this year, we expect to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $30 million or $0.05 of diluted EPS to fund these initiatives.
Turning to our International business. We're aiming to strengthen our long-term position in Canada as the leading provider of consumer electronics products, services and solutions by consolidating our Future Shop brand into the Best Buy brand. This plan includes permanently closing 66 Future Shop locations, which we did in March, and converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations and Future Shop website to the Best Buy brand. With these store closures, the company now has a total of 192 locations across Canada, including 136 large-format stores and 56 Best Buy mobile stores.
This plan also includes building a leading multi-channel customer experience, which replicates successful aspects of our domestic Renew Blue strategy, including launching major appliances in all stores; working with our vendor partners to bring their products to life in a more compelling way; increasing our staffing levels to better serve our customers; and investing in the online shopping experience, including expanding our in-store pickup areas, launching ship-from-store and introducing the marketplace program.
To deliver this leading multi-channel experience as we've previously discussed, we're projecting to invest up to $160 million in capital over the next 2 years.
So in summary, while the consumer electronics industry is subject to product cycles, we are excited about the role that technology plays in people's lives and the opportunities that this creates. We are also confident that we're executing against the right investment strategy that will allow us to capitalize on key technology waves and customer experience opportunities to build sustainable long-term shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our first quarter financials and our financial outlook."
255397,296208173,820965,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 21, 2015",2015-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.Our Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expect",1221,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.
Our Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expectations due to stronger-than-expected growth in our Domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded our expectations by 30 to 50 basis points due to a mix shift to higher-margin computing hardware and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio, again, in our Domestic business.
I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 0.9% to $8.6 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.02 to $0.37, driven primarily by lower net interest expense and a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate due to a discrete income tax benefit in the quarter.
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.4% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by an estimated 130 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a $40 million or 50 basis point improvement in the performance of our credit card portfolio, partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 0.7%, including installment billing.
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 5.3%, primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue also increased 30 basis points to 8.5% versus 8.2% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 29.2%, this year's online growth rate of 5.3% was primarily due to the expected 1,000 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming console introductions and the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store as well as the industry softness in tablets and computing, which represent a large percentage of our online revenue.
We do expect the online growth rate to continue to be lower than last year's growth rate in Q2 due to, again, lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year.
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in televisions, mobile phones and major appliances was more than offset by declines in tablets and computing. We also saw a comparable sales decline in services. This decline of 10.3% was primarily driven, though, by the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower claim frequency, an operational positive, and lower extended warranty attach rates.
In our International segment, revenue declined 22.1% to $668 million due to a negative foreign currency impact of 1,000 basis points, the loss of revenue from 1 month of the Canadian brand consolidation and ongoing softness in the Canadian consumer electronics industry.
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the first quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% last year, an increase of 10 basis points. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 20 basis points to 22.9% versus 22.7% last year. This increase was primarily due to a 40 basis point benefit from our credit card portfolio, a positive mix shift to higher-margin computing hardware and additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency.
These increases were partially offset by increasing inventory reserves on non-iconic phone inventory due to declining inventory valuation and a negative mix shift into certain lower-margin iconic phones.
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 100 basis points to 22.8% versus 23.8% last year. This decline was primarily due to the disruptive impact from the Canadian brand consolidation and increased commercial activity in Canada.
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue versus 20.2% last year, a dollar decrease of $5 million but a rate increase of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus 19.6% last year, an increase of $35 million or 20 basis points, primarily driven by approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation.
These increases were partially offset by the realization of last year's annualized Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and a discrete benefit from an operating tax settlement.
International non-GAAP SG&A was $179 million or 26.8% of revenue versus 25.5% of revenue last year, a decrease of $40 million. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rate and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. From a rate perspective, the 130 basis point rate increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.
For the balance of the year, as we announced in March, we are continuing to project a non-GAAP diluted EPS impact from the Canadian brand consolidation in the range of negative $0.10 to $0.20 due to lost revenue from the closed stores, disruption to the rebranded stores and higher SG&A due to the short-term investments we are making to maximize customer retention from the closed stores.
This non-GAAP diluted EPS impact, which was minimal in the first quarter due to just 1 month of disruption, is expected to be fully incurred in fiscal '16. The top line negative impact from the store closings net of customer retention rates, however, is expected to continue long term. Ultimately, we expect the Canadian business to be more vibrant and more profitable, with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate.
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This outlook is based on the following assumptions: number one, in the Domestic business, a flat to positive low single-digit revenue growth rate; two, higher year-over-year non-GAAP Domestic SG&A dollars due to increased investments in future growth initiatives and SG&A inflation; three, in International, a revenue decline of 30% to 35% due to store closures and overall disruption from the Canadian brand consolidation in addition to the ongoing negative impact of foreign exchange rates; and four, an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 3.5% to negative 5%, reflecting the near-term impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation that we've already discussed.
With these assumptions, our Enterprise outlook for second quarter includes a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a year-over-year non-GAAP operating income rate decline in the range of negative 30 to 50 basis points, which is in line with our previous outlook. This revised outlook, however, now assumes a strengthening in our Domestic business versus the previous outlook, offset by the near-term impact of the Canadian brand consolidation. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 40%.
While underlying this outlook is a cautious view on the NPD consumer electronics categories overall, we are encouraged by the strong product cycles in large-screen, high-definition televisions, where we have a high market share, and our momentum in the growing categories like mobile phones and appliances, where we have a relatively low market share. So with these opportunities and our track record in outperforming the NPD categories, we are confident in our ability to execute against the outlook we provided today.

The 5.3% decline we called out pertains to the NPD-tracked categories, which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included",499,"Yes. So we need to be very clear. The 5.3% decline we called out pertains to the NPD-tracked categories, which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included in there, in particular phones and appliances as well as gaming and entertainment. As you would know, phones and appliances are growing categories. Now there's not immediately available precise information on these categories. But I think if you look around, you will assume that phones and appliances, in particular, are growing nicely. So I would not conclude -- even though we don't have precise facts for the quarter, I would not conclude that the industry as a whole is down by that much, okay? So that's the first. I think it's really important to understand from an investment thesis standpoint the industry is not down 5%, okay? Now hard to track exactly the number, but it's not down 5%. Now talking about categories we're excited about into the future, I think we've been consistent in saying, in fact, in particular, that phones and appliances were a key area of focus for us. These are large markets that are growing, where our market share is low. So that's a significant area of focus, as we talked about. And you're very familiar with some of the investments we're making, we'd called them out on the call. The area of Connected Home is also an area of intense focus from a strategic standpoint. And it's not just the lighting or the locks, it's the fact that all of our homes are connected today, right, compared to, remember, a few years ago, you had a PC, you had a CRT TV and a nice stereo system. Now everything is connected, which provides opportunities for us as there's a gap between what customers understand they can do with technology and what technology can do. So we are there to close these gaps. So we think about these waves of technology, and I've given you 2 or 3 areas of intensive interest. As relates to efficiencies, I think our entire strategy since day one of Renew Blue has been a balance of view between cost and revenue between the customers and the efficiencies, which is why we have this second phase of Renew Blue cost takeout that we've quantified at $400 million. As a management team, we're as intensively focused on that second phase as we were on the first phase. It's different in nature, though. So it's more related to eliminating waste, driving efficiencies in our processes. So it goes after more structural systems-driven improvements, which is why we've indicated that they would take effect -- start seeing the results in the next few quarters as opposed to in the first half of the year. But we're not betting on the market to all of a sudden becoming a rising sea to go after these efficiencies. This is a dual-track strategy."

The market is actually not up in the quarter. It had been up in Q4. It's not up in Q1. However, you have something that is going on, which is a genuine customer interest for larger-screen televisions, in particular as the quality of the pictures has improved and partly that's driven by 4K. A large-screen television is actually very appealing, given a set number of pixels. And so what you're seeing is this wave in the large-screen television. What you're also seeing for us, and let me emphasize this because that's something we control, the work that our teams, our merchandising team has done in the stores, in particular, to showcase the latest TVs is quite extraordinary. As you know, we've done that in partnership with some of our key vendors in the stores, so Sony and Samsung, in particular, with a pretty dramatic exposition of the TVs as well as investment in expert labor. So there's more knowledgeable labor. And so for these new TVs, I'm going to be judge and jury, but I'm going to say we're the destination for both, and the better customer experience is really driving the market -- what I'd say, the material market share gain for us. Now looking ahead at holiday, I think the one piece of uncertainty is going to be what the average selling prices are going to do in the back half as it relates to these TVs. So there's no doubt that the customer interest will continue, but the average selling price, of course, in our industry has a big impact on our top line. How much deflation we will get, I think it's anybody's -- it's a bet at this point in time. These are some of the key mechanics of what we are seeing."

And I'll just add to that, that another place where we are, in our minds, clearly being able to inspire the customer and be able to put ourselves in a better position, of course, is from the promise that we can make to the customer on advice, service and convenience. Hubert talked a lot about it in his prepared remarks. And we clearly recognize that when somebody's in a Best Buy store and they are looking to invest in this type of technology, which is complex technology, that we have a service offering that is not available across the landscape of retail, and it makes a significant difference when you are changing technologies like this.

I just described what we expect around the industry for television going into the back half. We are extremely focused in the back half of the year on executing against the Renew Blue initiatives that we had laid out earlier in the Q4 release and then, of course, the efforts that we have been putting towards our waste efficiency and other types of optimization -- margin optimization initiatives. So we'll give you guys more color. We are very confident as we look toward the back half of the year in what we can execute at Best Buy. We are making a lot of progress on the systems side. You guys are giving us the latitude of being able to make these investments in our future growth initiatives. And as a result of that, we have taken that and run with it. You can see what we have been doing. We actually told you guys we would allow you to track that. We gave you real numbers this quarter around how much we invested in the first quarter in order to be able to drive the type of outcome you would all be looking for in the back half of the year that we're, ourselves, looking for. So we are -- as we go into Q4, everything we are doing right now is to be able to execute another very strong fourth quarter. And again, these cycles are very -- I think are going to be helpful to us. While we don't like where NPD is, we don't sit around internally talking about NPD being down x percent. Our field teams are obsessed with the ability to continue to drive our outcomes that are in our control, not allowing the industry to dictate it. And if you saw the momentum that we're seeing right now in the field, we haven't talked a lot about ISP, our individual sales tracking and the work that we're doing against that. So we have a lot going on right now that we believe is all setting us up to really execute well in Q4. We can't tell you what the industry is going to look like. We can't tell you what -- exactly what products are going to be the big sellers, but what we can tell you is that with the investments we're making and what is happening right now, I call it magic in our stores, we are prepared to execute a really strong Q4."

So it is a combination of 2 things. But the place, Matt, where we will be cautious or we -- it's not cautious, it is a macro situation that we have to recognize is that the economy is tracking along. At any point, there can be moments in the economy, both positive and negative, but the negative ones are going to probably impact your loss ratios. We tend to operate at a very high credit score.

And because, remember, last year we were investing each quarter, measuring and then continuing, so it accumulates. And then, of course, it comes -- whatever we did in Q3 and Q4 of last year, it just goes into Q1. So absolutely, invested in price. On the phone reserve, it's very simple. There are some very strong phones in the market, and then there are other inventories that you may have, whether they are new or open-box. And these inventories, because of installment billing, a customer buying a used phone or a new phone or a higher-priced phone, the monthly charge of that is quite small -- the difference. So I can buy a more expensive phone without a lot of financial impact to myself through installment billing. So it takes the valuation on some of the less iconic phones, and it impairs them. And I think that the great news is that we are so strong in the iconic ones that we saw this incredible performance of mobile. And the other side of that [indiscernible] is driven by that is this what happens to the other phones when that occurs. So we do not see this as a long-term issue or something that's going to continue each quarter, but it is associated with the other side of our performance, which was a very, overall, including this reserve, strong performance in mobile."

Again, what we're anticipating, of course, is that we're going to see positive revenue. And when we see that, depending on the mix of that revenue, we'll see how that plays out. It gets into some of the discussion that we had about this increase in volume. In some of these categories you're seeing declining ASPs, but you're going to see more volume. We're expecting to see a strong -- remember, what we said, strong product cycle in television? So that is a possibility. But I think that when we look at our business, it is difficult by line item to give future outlook. From an execution point of view, obviously, we do feel like we are going to have a solid outcome. Now remember, on the OI rate, we are making -- Q2 is going to be one of our big quarters of our investment in our growth initiatives. Across the board in just about every one that we laid out, there is a layering in of expense in the second quarter. So on the SG&A side, while you may see it in gross profit in the way you've modeled, I would tell you that on the SG&A side is where we actually are anticipating to see much more pressure. So gross profit is interesting. But actually, the place where the Q2 -- and this started -- we talked about this even last quarter, it hasn't changed. What did change -- as far as those investments went, what did change is the fact we're going to have the higher revenue in the Domestic business, which gives us certainly more leverage of those investments in Q2. So that was a little circular way. You asked me a specific question, I had to go to the SG&A because in your modeling, you're looking at it at gross profit, but it's really SG&A."

Thank you for the opportunity to lay out what's happening in Canada. This was obviously a very significant decision we made. So as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've closed the stores that we were going to close. We've also closed the Future Shop site. The Best Buy stores are doing great. There's a lot of momentum there. The remaining Future Shop stores, the 65 that are open and that are converting to Best Buy, are very much in a period of transition, very important to understand. If you go to Toronto or Vancouver, you're going to be surprised because you're going to see Future Shop stores that are operating with sales associates wearing a blue T-shirt, and so that's a bit confusing for the customer. So let me describe now what's ahead of us. What's ahead of us over this summer, we're going to re-sign, if you will, or change the signage and really convert the Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores. So by the end of the summer, they will look like Best Buy stores, and that's going to take the next 3 months. The other thing that we're very excited about -- well, let me first say, I'm very proud of one thing, which is how our Canadian team has remained extremely focused on serving the customers during that period of time. So I have to salute them there. What we are excited about is the work that the team started to do after we announced, because remember that before the announcement this was a fairly closely held decision. So they started to work -- we started to work with our vendor partners in Canada, and we started to work on the design of the stores of the future, if I can call them that. Very encouraged by the reaction from the vendor community that see the change was made as a material opportunity because it gives them the opportunity to invest in fewer stores and make them great, which is the essence of this transition to multi-channel. When you go to the store, the customer experience needs to be amazing. So the teams are working on this design. Later this year, we will implement in a few stores. We're still defining exactly how many, but it's likely to be a handful, roughly speaking, of stores that are going to be representative of what the stores are going to look like in the future. In these stores, there will be disruptions because it's a complete revamp of the store, then we'll see how it does during holiday. And next year, we will expand that to the remainder of the chain. So this is really next year after we've done the conversions and the investments that we'll have a good sense of what the ongoing retention will be. So far, we're pleased by what we're seeing, but I don't think it's meaningful, right, as the essential idea was not simply to close stores because the customers -- you're not doing anything for the customer but to reinvent the customer experience as we move forward. And I think what we're going to see is going to be exciting. But it's going to be a journey as many things we do. Sharon, about the $0.10 to $0.20."

In Q2, you're going to see, obviously, a bigger impact than Q1. Remember, we only had 1 month in Q1. So I think that I've actually given you specific OI rate guidance for Q2. So there's no mystery in what Q2 is. Last year, the International rate was a negative 3%. They're coming up against a very weak quarter last year. So the impact doesn't look as big in Q2. But if you got to the high -- the low end of the range that I provided on the outlook, which was a negative 5% for Canada, that would be looking something like a $0.01 or so of negative impact to the EPS. And then in Q3, it's going to get bigger, and the largest piece of it is going to come in Q4. You've got to remember that in Canada, historically, their jump from Q2 to Q3 on revenue, if you just look at the International segment, is much bigger than the way the U.S. jumps from Q2 to Q3, and then it jumps again from Q3 to Q4. So that's how you should be modeling your impact as you look there. And then in Q3, as Hubert mentioned, all the work that we will be able to get done this year, we will, of course, do before we go into holiday. So Q3 gets some pressure from that as well."

As it relates to the U.S., the situation -- I would say 2 things. We've always said that we would, on an ongoing basis, optimize our store footprint. So I will reiterate that. This said, the situation in Canada is completely different from the U.S. In Canada, the store footprint was driven by these 2 brands. So again, for those of us who have been to Canada, we have seen these parking lots where you have the Best Buy store and in the same parking lot quite often, a Future Shop store. So that's a gift from heaven, right, because the retention there is going to be quite extraordinary if we manage to create something great for the customers in the remaining stores. The configuration of the store footprint in the U.S. has nothing to do with that because we've always had only one brand. And so it's not the same kind of opportunity. What we saw in Canada or what our Canadian team saw is the fact that, as many of you would have guessed, consolidating the 2 brands was the right thing to do and was going to unlock the opportunity to save on SG&A and be able to invest with our vendor partners strategically in the remaining stores. Different situation in the U.S. This said, of course, we will look, we're always learning. So we'll look at what we can learn from the Canadian experience. But the translation is not going to be immediate, I want to be very clear about that."

One area that I have commented upon is appliance delivery and installation. It's a big part of our growth strategy. And doing appliance delivery and installation right is not easy. You're talking about moving large SKU, making sure it's not damaged in the process, then delivering it in people's homes. If there is installation work related to gas or electricity or water, getting a licensed professional into people's homes and coordinating the entire process is an area where -- that we identified as a -- candidly as an area of opportunity, where we have high standards at Best Buy, where we want to make this great and a source of differentiation. So there's a process redesign work going on, both impacting the online buying experience as well as the in-store buying experience because everything needs to go well at every step in the process. So that's an example of fixing pain points. On the flip side, an example of providing an inspiring customer experience, which is the -- increasingly, we're going to spend more time on the latter, I would highlight a couple of things that we are excited about and that I briefly mentioned, which is the in-home consultations provided today in particular by our Magnolia teams, and that would apply to probably everyone on the phone. If one day you feel that your network is not functioning properly, and I'm assuming that would be a widespread phenomenon, or if you're asking yourself questions about how your audio or video systems should evolve, we provide the service. We will go to your home, and we'll have a professional that will work with you, understand your situation, your needs and come up with something that is a range of solutions. And when you think about the entire realm around video, around entertainment, around productivity, around your home office, around security, around access to content, there's so many complex areas, and being able to go to your home is something that is very inspiring. Similarly, classes, we've deployed -- we're deploying in a number of our stores camera experience stores, where we have in a hub-and-spoke system a bigger assortment, better staffing, better expertise. We're also doing classes in these camera experience stores. And for those of us who are passionate about photography, this is something that is inspiring, creates traffic to the stores, creates, of course, add-on sales opportunities. So these are the range of examples that we are working on and that can provide opportunities for us.

I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. I will then provide highlights of the progress we are making against our priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. The results we're reporting today are strong with both significant top line and bottom line growth in the Domestic business. We believe these better-than-expected results are affirmation that our strategy of offering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" is paying off. 
So more specifically, Enterprise revenue grew 0.8% to $8.5 billion driven by a 3.9% increase in the Domestic segment, partially offset by the impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and 120 basis points of pressure from foreign currency. Better year-over-year performance in the Domestic segment drove a 50 basis point increase in the Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to 3.4% and a 17% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $0.49. We also returned $321 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition to $81 million in regular dividends. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales increased 2.7%, excluding the impact of installment billing, driven by continued strong performance in major appliances, large-screen televisions and mobile phones. Online comparable sales increased 17% as our investments in new capabilities continue to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. 
We also saw industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories, which represent 65% of our revenue, improve from a decline of 5.3% in Q1 to a decline of 1.3% in Q2. 
In the International business, while revenue declined due to stock closures in foreign currency, we're seeing higher-than-expected retention from the 66 permanently closed Future Shop locations in Canada. We're now in the midst of converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations to the Best Buy brand. And much of the work and investments around building a superior multi-channel customer experience are still ahead of us as we will discuss later in the call today. 
Now before I share specific highlights on our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives, I'd like to discuss a few strategic observations about what we believe has been driving our recent performance. And while recognizing the current turbulence in the financial markets, we do feel this is an opportune time to do this as it is almost 3 years to the day of my appointment and the nearly 3 years since the launch of our Renew Blue strategy. 
Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services, including appliances and mobile phones, is growing. This growth is driven by technology product innovation -- excuse me, driven by technology product innovation and by macro factors such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, Connected Home and health and wearables business, which we believe will remain positive catalysts in quarters to come. 
In addition, the increasing complexity interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help, selecting, installing, connecting integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products. 
Our second observation, which I mentioned earlier, is that the investments that we've made in our Renew Blue strategy to offer ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" are paying off. This is evidenced by the market share gains we have achieved in the NPD-tracked categories, our growth in appliances and mobile phones and the overall positive Domestic comps and expanded operating income rate that we have delivered both last year and year-to-date this year. 
Our third and final observation is that we have 3 distinct competitive advantages that help us win with customers, drive better financial results and are hard for competitors to replicate. 
The first competitive advantage is our ability to serve our customers online, in-store and in their home. What does this mean? We now offer a leading-edge digital shopping experience to our customers online and in our new mobile app, and we also have stores within 15 minutes of 70% of the U.S. population that not only provide advice, service and convenience to our in-store customers but also operate as local distribution centers to provide online customers with greater inventory availability and faster delivery. And through Geek Squad, we're able to provide an array of services to our customers remotely in our stores and in their home. 
The second competitive advantage is our positioning in the marketplace, which allows us to benefit from early adopters who choose Best Buy when new exciting technology is released. And our strong merchandising and vendor partnerships allow us to showcase the best of what is selling, which, in turn, positions us to outperform the sales trends within the NPD-tracked computer -- consumer electronics categories even when they are negative. 
This leads us to our third competitive advantage, which is our vendor partnerships. Not only do we showcase the best of what our vendors offer, we're also benefiting from the material investments that several of the world's leading technology companies are making in our stores. With these partnerships, we're able to bring to life interactive technology experiences that again make the Best Buy operating model more relevant for customers. And as you'll hear later in the call, our vendor partnerships are continuing to grow, confirming that they are bringing value not only to our customers and Best Buy but also to our vendor partners. 
So now with these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss our progress on key fiscal '16 initiatives. This quarter, I'm going to start with Services as it is a critical component of our Renew Blue strategy. We have significant Services assets today, including our ability to assist customers in our stores remotely and in their homes. We currently have approximately 20,000 Geek Squad agents and Magnolia system designers, and we're proud of the services we offer as they generate some of our highest NPS scores. 
Now 2 things have been negatively impacting our Services top line. The first is the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties. This has the impact of reducing our repair revenue, which at face value appears negative but is actually beneficial both financially and operationally. 
The second is the decline of our traditional warranty business. We are addressing this decline by materially renewing our service offerings to make them compelling and price competitive. More broadly, we are ramping up our strategic investments in our Services business to make it play an increasing role in our Renew Blue transformation as a differentiator, as a business driver and as a profit center in its own right. 
In this context, we have several new developments to share this quarter. They're all part of evolving this business from a traditional warranty business to a value-added services business that addresses the help our customers need. 
So first in our computing and tablet service categories, beginning September 13, we are launching a range of services, including Geek Squad protect and support plus, which combines hardware support, 24/7 software support and accidental damage in one plan priced very competitively. 
Second, we will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter, and additionally, we will proceed to roll out our capabilities as an Apple authorized service provider first with install pilots in 50 locations by holiday. 
Third, we begin to offer a range of classes to help customers take advantage of their technology products, including in our digital imaging hub in our Samsung Experience Shops and in our Windows stores around the launch of Windows 10. 
In support of this Services strategy, we are investing in talent, systems and processes to further enhance the quality and scope of the services we deliver to our customers. We are also continuing to drive operational and cost efficiencies, which are resulting in reduced repair costs and a higher year-over-year gross profit rate. 
I'll now turn to our progress on our merchandising initiatives. In Appliances, we've rolled out 35 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen and Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year, increasing their presence to 152 of our stores. We also began the rollout of our expanded Samsung appliance experiences and expect to rollout approximately 225 Samsung open houses by the end of the year, which will be the largest dedicated in-store display of Samsung Appliances in the U.S. 
In home theater, we've continued to solidify our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry-leading home theater technology, particularly high definition -- excuse me, ultra-high definition or 4k TVs. We've expanded our Samsung home theater stores-within-a-store from 500 at launch to 603 and the Sony home theater stores-within-a-store from 350 at launch to 372. 
We've also rolled out 5 of the 20 planned Magnolia Design Centers store-within-a-store for this year, increasing their presence to 63 of our stores. And as we enter the back half of the year and as pricing of these technologies becomes even more affordable, we believe that we will continue to benefit from the customer moving to larger screen televisions and 4k  technology. 
In computing, we believe we are optimally positioned to help customers transition to the new Windows 10 operating system that was introduced at the end of July. We have a very large selection of laptops with Windows 10 already installed and a compelling in-store experience with our Windows store-within-a-store. Today, we have over 600 of these in the U.S. and expect to have over 800 by holiday. 
We've also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. We've already implemented approximately 350 of them and expect to upgrade the total of approximately 520 by holiday. 
The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale in bestbuy.com and in more than 100 of our stores in August. Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4, we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy mobile stores by the end of September. 
Now I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. In the second quarter, we continue to leverage our ship-from-store digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 17% increase in Domestic comparable online sales. This growth was driven number one, by a significantly increased number of our online customers who received and took advantage of our free 2-day shipping promise, enabled by enhancements to our ship-from-store capability and supply chain investments that are driving the improved speed, convenience and reliability; number two, increased -- by the increased visibility of open box and clearance inventory; and number three, by the expansion of online only/sales. 
We also launched several customer-facing site improvements, including expanded payment options for our customers through partnering with American Express to offer pay with points, the ability to search and shop by brand and a significantly more relevant recommendation engine. 
Turning to costs. To date, we have eliminated $100 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over the next -- over 3 years. These savings will be offset, however, by the incremental investments in our future growth initiatives, which will this year we expect to be approximately $120 million. 
To date, we've invested approximately $65 million to fund these initiatives, of which $35 million was in the second quarter. So to repeat, we are proud of the results we are reporting today. As we look forward, the combination of an opportunity rich environment and the strength of our competitive advantages lead us to have a positive outlook about our future prospects starting with the important back-to-school third quarter. And so, of course, we'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and contributions to our success. The opportunities we have before us today are possible because of the talent and engagement of our entire team, and I'm extremely proud of their performance and availability to win. 
I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our third quarter outlook."

Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion exceeded our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected overall performance in our Domestic business in addition to higher sales retention from previously closed stores in our Canadian brand consolidation. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% also exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate in our computing business, a higher gross profit rate in our services business due to a periodic profit-sharing payment from our externally managed expanded service plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio. As Hubert said, we're extremely proud of the team who drove these better-than-expected results. 
I will now talk to you about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.8% to $8.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.49, driven primarily by stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business from higher sales volume, improved gross profit rates and a $0.04 periodic profit-sharing payment in deferred revenue adjustment that we just discussed. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from a higher effective income tax rate due to a discrete tax benefit in Q2 fiscal '15 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.9% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2.7%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 110 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment in Services. 
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 17% driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 8.6% versus 7.7% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 22%, this year's online growth rate of 17% was lower, primarily due to lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. This ship-from-store impact will continue through the back half of this year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in major appliances, televisions, mobile phones and health and fitness was partially offset by ongoing declines in tablets. In Services, revenues declined 13.1%. As Hubert discussed earlier, this is primarily due to lower repair revenue and through a much lesser extent, declining attach rates to our traditional warranty business. Since we expect this trend of lower repair revenue to continue, which is a positive, comparable sales and Services are expected to continue to decline through the back half of this year. 
In our International segment, revenue declined 25.6% to $650 million due to the loss of revenue associated with the closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,200 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and Canadian consumer electronics industry. 
Turning now to gross profits. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 24.4%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 24.6%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity; a rate improvement in computing hardware; an increased mix of higher margin large-screen television; a 25 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing payment in deferred revenue adjustment we previously discussed; and a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category. These increases were partially offset by a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher-priced iconic mobile phones, which delivered higher gross profit dollars that carry a lower gross profit rate. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 22.9%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $57 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 20.6% of revenue, an increase of $114 million or 70 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by investments in future growth initiatives in addition to higher SG&A inflation and incentive compensation. International non-GAAP SG&A was $170 million or 26.2% of revenue, a decrease of $57 million but a rate increase of 20 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 20 basis point increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred approximately $0.02 of negative non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first half of the year, which was lower than expected due to retaining sales at a higher than expected rate. 
As such, we are reducing our estimated impact of the consolidation to a range of $0.10 to $0.17 in fiscal 2016 versus our original estimate of a negative $0.10 to $0.20 as the retention rate trends are expected to continue in the back half of the year. 
By quarter, this expectation is broken down as follows: the negative $0.02 per share that we incurred in the first half, a negative $0.04 to $0.06 per share in Q3 and a negative $0.04 to $0.09 per share in Q4. 
Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and more profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the second quarter, we returned over $400 million in cash to our shareholders, $321 million through share repurchases and $81 million in regular dividend. 
In addition, in the last 2 weeks, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded Best Buy's debt ratings by one notch. Moody's raised their rating to Baa1 and Standard & Poor's raised theirs to BB+. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, our competitive advantages and strong execution give us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry, which both bodes well for us as we enter the third quarter. 
It is difficult to know though if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending. To date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations. So as such, our outlook assumes that there will be no material changes in consumer spending in the third quarter. 
With that said, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q3 fiscal '16 is as follows. In the Domestic business, we are expecting flat to low single-digit revenue growth and an approximately flat operating income rate driven by a higher gross profit rate, offset by increased SG&A due to inflation and growth related investments. 
In the International business due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation and foreign currency, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%. 
With these expectations, which assumed continued strength in our Domestic business offset by the near-term impact of Canada, at the Enterprise level, we expect a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and an operating income rate growth of flat to negative 20 basis points. This includes an approximately 15 basis point negative year-over-year impact in the Domestic business due to an $11.5 million or $0.02 per share legal settlement that we received in Q3 of last year that will not recur this year. 
Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 39% to 40% versus 38.1% last year, which could result in a negative $0.01 year-over-year non-GAAP diluted EPS impact in Q3 fiscal '16. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we are seeing sustained growth now over many, many quarters in our appliance business. This is driven by number one, the markets. The housing recovery continues to be strong, and you're seeing the customers equip their new house or replace their old appliances. It's a very positive factor. And then second, investments in the appliance sector continue to be very strong. The deployment of the Pacific Kitchen and Home stores-within-a-store in particular is helping us drive better customer experience and market share in particular not only in the extreme high end but also in the better and best part of the market, which is where a lot of the interesting action is. We're also investing in the customer experience in appliance delivery and installation standpoint. So these are very fundamental and sustained improvements.

So we see a number of very strong drivers of performance getting into the back half of the year.

What we have said in our prepared remarks is that we believe there are powerful trends from a demand standpoint around appliances, around TVs, around health and fitness and wearables and around Connected Home. The other thing I would say more broadly speaking not specific to Q4 from a competitive standpoint, if we step back a little bit and I could have included that in my remarks about the last 3 years, it feels I don't know whether all of you will agree with that, but that the competitive landscape has, indeed, changed a little bit in the last 3 years. There's a number of players who have decided to de-emphasize or in some cases, exit their category, and so that's an important factor. It's true that it's a tough category. So there you go. The other thing that has changed in the last 3 years that is actually very notable is the fact that today, 89% of the U.S. population lives within states where one of our online competitor, headquartered in Seattle, now collects the sales tax. And so 3 years ago, it was less than 50%. It was probably around 40%. So that's a very material change over a period of 3 years. So altogether, from a strategic standpoint, we see these growth drivers, and I would add based on your question the overall competitive landscape has changed somewhat in the last 3 years."

We've commented on marketing on every one of our previous call. We've had a very material transformation of our marketing efforts in the last 3 years with the headline being, of course, more personalized, and we went from analog and mass communication to much more targeted, relevant, personalized, digital communication. So, as it relates to the shops within a shop, one of the things, of course, is that there's not one of each in every store. So as an example, we have the ability to target the messages in a relevant fashion or we have the ability to target previous users of a particular brands and communicate the news and excitement about new product introductions. More broadly speaking, I am very excited about how these partnerships with our key vendors have evolved. It's more than just about the physical layout in the stores. These are very closed partnerships because I think these leading tech companies invest in billions of dollars in R&D. They have some very exciting new products, which are, of course, really coming to market, and the collaboration that Best Buy has with some of these -- of the foremost companies on the planet in the tech sector is very inspiring that includes from a merchandising standpoint as well as from a marketing standpoint and now also from a Services standpoint. And so yes, it it's an entire collaboration, and I think we can attribute some of our performance to this more targeted, more relevant communication.

So, so far, things are really progressing very nicely. The reason we don't give a specific number is again in part for competitive reasons; two, it's early days; and three, as all of you know, north of the border, the economy, which is highly dependent on raw materials and the oil sector in particular, has been impacted. The exchange rate is down, which is, of course, increasing the prices of consumer electronics product, which is slowing down demand. So today, the better-than-expected retention is somewhat offset, of course, by the weakness of the Canadian economy. I think you'll be able to assess with reliability the final results once we're through the conversion and once we've upgraded the customer experience. But altogether, it was obviously the right thing to do, and it's progressing quite, quite nicely in a somewhat challenged Canadian economy."

So when you think about that because of higher dollars, so I would say that it was certainly a traffic driver, and we are thrilled to have new traffic driver this year, something very iconic. I think we can all agree the Apple Watch is certainly iconic and having it in all 1,000 stores by the end of September is a big deal for us."

As it relates to the second part of your question, which is the promotional discipline, this is an area we have invested in. I think if I step back over the last 3 years, we've had several phases. One is we established a Price Match policy; two, we have invested significantly in our price competitiveness starting with hardware and then accessories. You've heard me talk this morning about Services. We have previewed that in previous quarter, but with the launch of Geek Squad protect and support plus, it's another step forward. And then another dimension you're talking about, which we have talked about last year, is the promotional display. We're applying more science and more tools to this area to make sure that the return on the promotional dollars is getting better and better. So we're continuing to see improved progress in this area, and we'll continue to deploy this as we move forward. We are a very data- and science-driven management team here on matters like that."

So let's start with the online components, which we report online sales. It's an important part of our business, but we believe that online and mobile are a much bigger part of the business than just the online sales because it's really the front door to the store. This is -- we all know this. This is where the customers start their search. So we are excited about the growth of online. We are excited about the increased traffic and the increased conversion rate. I think the improvements that have been made on the site and in the app over the last 3 years are just extraordinary. Now we had a long way to go, but I'm very proud now of where we are. Sales continued progress will be made in the checkout, in the customer experience. Significant improvement from a supply chain standpoint has been transformative. The speed at which we are shipping now, in particular enabled by ship-from-store, has been a phenomenal transformation. Now the customers may start the journey online, they often go to the stores. Now we always -- we believe that as a result of these trends in consumer behavior, the store experience need to be so much better, right? Because when the customer gets to the store, she has done a lot of research, and she's much more educated than maybe a few years ago. And so maybe in some cases, we see fewer trips to the store because so much time has been spent before the store. And so the focus in the store is on the customer experience. So both -- so first physically and with -- together with these vendors, we've invested significantly in the physical experience in the stores. And candidly, it is so helpful. You cannot use your senses online to see the difference in picture quality of the TV of the sound quality of the headphone. You really have to go to the store. And then, of course, there's the Blue Shirts. Our associates are such a formidable weapon for us, and I hope we're doing a good job this morning of thanking them on the call for their amazing performance and the entire leadership in retail. I think your question refers in particular to the comments we made about the increased proficiency that we've made the associates are in the stores. Even though we've taken $1 billion of cost out, we've actually increased the amount of customer-facing labor, and we've increased the product knowledge, the engagement and the overall sales proficiency. So we've talked about it as IST individual sales productivity, individual sales tracking. This program is has continued to be deployed, and we can measure the improvements as a particular area of focus. Our store leadership is focused on what they call, what we call value-add, which is the difference between the comps in the stores and the traffic. So it's really focused on what they control in the stores, and we're seeing continued progress from that, one incredibly proud of what we're seeing in the stores. Now there's more to come. I think that I'd be lying to you if I was going to tell you that we are consistently excellent. There's a number of stores and number of associates that still have progress to make, but it's the combination of this better installed performance and the excellent merchandising, the supply chain, the marketing, the service components, really the integration of all these capabilities that is resulting in these better-than-expected and better period results. So continued progress on all of these fronts."

So the implementation of IST last year, if you just go back and look at when we first started talking about IST, and you look at the outcomes that we have been seeing in the retail stores because remember that the retail stores delivered significantly positive comps this quarter. So we definitely believe that there's a correlation there, and we are optimistic that we will continue to see longer-term improvements as Hubert describes the proficiency that we are trying to build through this program."

I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. I will then provide highlights of the progress we are making against our priorities, and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. The results we're reporting today are strong with both significant top line and bottom line growth in the Domestic business. We believe these better-than-expected results are affirmation that our strategy of offering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" is paying off. So more specifically, Enterprise revenue grew 0.8% to $8.5 billion driven by a 3.9% increase in the Domestic segment, partially offset by the impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and 120 basis points of pressure from foreign currency. Better year-over-year performance in the Domestic segment drove a 50 basis point increase in the Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to 3.4% and a 17% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $0.49. We also returned $321 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition to $81 million in regular dividends. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales increased 2.7%, excluding the impact of installment billing, driven by continued strong performance in major appliances, large-screen televisions and mobile phones. Online comparable sales increased 17% as our investments in new capabilities continued to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. We also saw industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories, which represent 65% of our revenue, improve from a decline of 5.3% in Q1 to a decline of 1.3% in Q2. 
In the International business, while revenue declined due to store closures and foreign currency, we're seeing higher-than-expected retention from the 66 permanently closed Future Shop locations in Canada. We're now in the midst of converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations to the Best Buy brand. And much of the work and investments around building a superior multichannel customer experience are still ahead of us as we will discuss later in the call today. 
Now before I share specific highlights on our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives, I'd like to discuss a few strategic observations about what we believe has been driving our recent performance. And while recognizing the current turbulence in the financial markets, we do feel this is an opportune time to do this as it is almost 3 years to the day of my appointment and nearly 3 years since the launch of our Renew Blue strategy. 
Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services, including appliances and mobile phones, is growing. This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by macro factors, such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, Connected Home and health and wearables businesses, which we believe will remain positive catalysts in quarters to come. In addition, the increasing complexity and interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help selecting, installing, connecting integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products. 
Our second observation, which I mentioned earlier, is that the investments that we've made in our Renew Blue strategy to offer ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" are paying off. This is evidenced by the market share gains we have achieved in the NPD-tracked categories, our growth in appliances and mobile phones and the overall positive Domestic comps and expanded operating income rate that we have delivered both last year and year-to-date this year. 
Our third and final observation is that we have 3 distinct competitive advantages that help us win with customers, drive better financial results and are hard for competitors to replicate. The first competitive advantage is our ability to serve our customers online, in-store and in their home. What does this mean? We now offer a leading-edge digital shopping experience to our customers online and in our new mobile app, and we also have stores within 15 minutes of 70% of the U.S. population that not only provide advice, service and convenience to our in-store customers but also operate as local distribution centers to provide online customers with greater inventory availability and faster delivery. And through Geek Squad, we're able to provide an array of services to our customers remotely in our stores and in their home. 
The second competitive advantage is our positioning in the marketplace, which allows us to benefit from early adopters, who choose Best Buy when new, exciting technology is released. And our strong merchandising and vendor partnerships allow us to showcase the best of what is selling, which in turn positions us to outperform the sales trends within the NPD-tracked consumer electronics categories, even when they are negative. 
This leads us to our third competitive advantage, which is our vendor partnerships. Not only do we showcase the best of what our vendors offer, we're also benefiting from the material investments that several of the world's leading technology companies are making in our stores. With these partnerships, we're able to bring to life interactive technology experiences that again make the Best Buy operating model more relevant for customers. And as you'll hear later in the call, our vendor partnerships are continuing to grow, confirming that they are bringing value not only to our customers and Best Buy but also to our vendor partners. 
So now with these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss our progress on key fiscal '16 initiatives. This quarter, I'm going to start with services as it is a critical component of our Renew Blue strategy. We have significant services assets today, including our ability to assist customers in our stores remotely and in their homes. We currently have approximately 20,000 Geek Squad agents and Magnolia system designers. And we're proud of the services we offer as they generate some of our highest NPS scores. 
Now 2 things have been negatively impacting our services top line. The first is the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties. This has the impact of reducing our repair revenue, which at face value appears negative but is actually beneficial both financially and operationally. The second is the decline of our traditional warranty business. We are addressing this decline by materially renewing our service offerings to make them compelling and price-competitive. More broadly, we are ramping up our strategic investments in our services business to make it play an increasing role in our Renew Blue transformation as a differentiator, as a business driver and as a profit center in its own right. 
In this context, we have several new developments to share this quarter. They're all part of evolving this business from a traditional warranty business to a value-added services business that addresses the help our customers need. So first, in our computing and tablet service categories, beginning September 13, we're launching a range of services, including Geek Squad protect and support plus, which combines hardware support, 24/7 software support and accidental damage in one plan priced very competitively. Second, we will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter. And additionally, we will proceed to roll out our capabilities as an Apple authorized service provider, first, with install pilots in 50 locations by holiday. Third, we'll begin to offer a range of classes to help customers take advantage of their technology products, including in our digital imaging hubs, in our Samsung Experience Shops and in our Windows Stores around the launch of Windows 10. 
In support of this services strategy, we are investing in talent, systems and processes to further enhance the quality and scope of the services we deliver to our customers. We're also continuing to drive operational and cost efficiencies, which are resulting in reduced repair costs and a higher year-over-year gross profit rate. 
I'll now turn to our progress on our merchandising initiatives. In appliances, we've rolled out 35 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year, increasing their presence to 152 of our stores. We also began the rollout of our expanded Samsung appliance experiences and expect to roll out approximately 225 Samsung open houses by the end of the year, which will be the largest dedicated in-store display of Samsung appliances in the U.S. 
In home theater, we've continued to solidify our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry-leading home theater technology, particularly ultra-high definition or 4K TVs. We've expanded our Samsung home theater stores-within-a-store from 500 at launch to 603 and the Sony home theater stores-within-a-store from 350 at launch to 372. We've also rolled out 5 of the 20 planned Magnolia Design Centers stores-within-a-store for this year, increasing their presence to 63 of our stores. And as we enter the back half of the year and as pricing of these technologies becomes even more affordable, we believe that we will continue to benefit from the customer moving to larger-screen televisions and 4K technology. 
In computing, we believe we are optimally positioned to help customers transition to the new Windows 10 operating system that was introduced at the end of July. We have a very large selection of laptops with Windows 10 already installed and a compelling in-store experience with our Windows store-within-a-store. Today, we have over 600 of these in the U.S. and expect to have over 800 by holiday. We've also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. We've already implemented approximately 350 of them and expect to upgrade a total of approximately 520 by holiday. 
The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale in bestbuy.com and in more than 100 of our stores in August. Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4, we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy mobile stores by the end of September. 
Now I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. In the second quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 17% increase in Domestic comparable online sales. This growth was driven, number one, by a significantly increased number of our online customers who received and took advantage of our free 2-day shipping promise, enabled by enhancements to our ship-from-store capability and supply chain investments that are driving improved speed, convenience and reliability; number two, by the increased visibility of open box and clearance inventory; and number three, by the expansion of online-only flash sales. We also launched several customer-facing site improvements, including expanded payment options for our customers through partnering with American Express to offer pay with points, the ability to search and shop by brand and a significantly more relevant recommendation engine. 
Turning to costs. To date, we have eliminated $100 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over the next -- over 3 years. These savings will be offset, however, by the incremental investments in our future growth initiatives, which will this year we expect to be approximately $120 million. To date, we've invested approximately $65 million to fund these initiatives, of which $35 million was in the second quarter. 
So to repeat, we are proud of the results we are reporting today. As we look forward, the combination of an opportunity-rich environment and the strength of our competitive advantages lead us to have a positive outlook about our future prospects, starting with the important back-to-school third quarter. And so of course, we'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and contributions to our success. The opportunities we have before us today are possible because of the talent and engagement of our entire team, and I am extremely proud of their performance and ability to win. 
I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our third quarter outlook."
255397,307598259,862112,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2015",2015-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5",1341,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion exceeded our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected overall performance in our Domestic business in addition to higher sales retention from previously closed stores in our Canadian brand consolidation. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% also exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate in our computing business, a higher gross profit rate in our services business due to a periodic profit-sharing payment from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio. As Hubert said, we are extremely proud of the teams who drove these better-than-expected results. 
I will now talk to you about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.8% to $8.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.49, driven primarily by stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business from higher sales volume, improved gross profit rates and a $0.04 periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment that we just discussed. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from a higher effective income tax rate due to a discrete tax benefit in Q2 fiscal '15 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.9% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2.7%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 110 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment in services. Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 17% driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 8.6% versus 7.7% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 22%, this year's online growth rate of 17% was lower, primarily due to lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. This ship-from-store impact will continue through the back half of this year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in major appliances, televisions, mobile phones and health and fitness was partially offset by ongoing declines in tablets. In services, revenues declined 13.1%. As Hubert discussed earlier, this is primarily due to lower repair revenue and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates in our traditional warranty business. Since we expect this trend of lower repair revenue to continue, which is a positive, comparable sales in services are expected to continue to decline through the back half of this year. 
In our International segment, revenue declined 25.6% to $650 million due to the loss of revenue associated with the closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,200 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and Canadian consumer electronics industry. 
Turning now to gross profits. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 24.4%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 24.6%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity; a rate improvement in computing hardware; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a 25 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment we previously discussed; and a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category. These increases were partially offset by a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher-priced iconic mobile phones, which deliver higher gross profit dollars but carry a lower gross profit rate. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 22.9%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $57 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 20.6% of revenue, an increase of $114 million or 70 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by investments in future growth initiatives in addition to SG&A inflation and higher incentive compensation. International non-GAAP SG&A was $170 million or 26.2% of revenue, a decrease of $57 million but a rate increase of 20 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 20 basis point increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred approximately $0.02 of negative non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first half of the year, which was lower than expected due to retaining sales at a higher-than-expected rate. As such, we are reducing our estimated impact of the consolidation to a range of $0.10 to $0.17 in fiscal 2016 versus our original estimate of a negative $0.10 to $0.20 as the retention rate trends are expected to continue in the back half of the year. By quarter, this expectation is broken down as follows: the negative $0.02 per share that we incurred in the first half, a negative $0.04 to $0.06 per share in Q3 and a negative $0.04 to $0.09 per share in Q4. Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and more profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the second quarter, we returned over $400 million in cash to our shareholders, $321 million through share repurchases and $81 million in regular dividends. In addition, in the last 2 weeks, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded Best Buy's debt rating by one notch. Moody's raised their rating to Baa1 and Standard & Poor's raised theirs to BB+. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, our competitive advantages and strong execution give us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry, which bodes well for us as we enter the third quarter. It is difficult to know though if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending. To date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations. So as such, our outlook assumes that there will be no material changes in consumer spending in the third quarter. 
With that said, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q3 fiscal '16 is as follows. In the Domestic business, we are expecting flat to low single-digit revenue growth and an approximately flat operating income rate driven by a higher gross profit rate, offset by increased SG&A due to inflation and growth-related investments. In the International business, due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation and foreign currency, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%. 
With these expectations, which assume continued strength in our Domestic business, offset by the near-term impact of Canada, at the Enterprise level, we expect a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and an operating income rate growth of flat to negative 20 basis points. This includes an approximately 15 basis point negative year-over-year impact in the Domestic business due to an $11.5 million or $0.02 per share legal settlement that we received in Q3 of last year that will not recur this year. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 39% to 40% versus 38.1% last year, which could result in a negative $0.01 year-over-year non-GAAP diluted EPS impact in Q3 fiscal '16. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we are seeing sustained growth now over many, many quarters in our appliance business. This is driven by, number one, the markets. The housing recovery continues to be strong, and you're seeing the customers equip their new house or replace their old appliances. It's a very positive factor. And then second, investments in the appliance sector continue to be very strong. The deployment of the Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store in particular is helping us drive better customer experience and market share in particular, not only in the extreme high end but also in the better and best part of the market, which is where a lot of the interesting action is. We're also investing in the customer experience from an appliance delivery and installation standpoint. So these are very fundamental and sustained improvements. Now Anthony, this may fluctuate a little bit quarter-after-quarter, but we do expect continued traction including given the competitive environments that I won't elaborate on.

So we see a number of very strong drivers of performance getting into the back half of the year. Now of course, as we get into these parts of the cycle, as you would expect, the margins are not going to continue at the same level. So the factor is the same, but it's a very powerful cycle."

What we have said in our prepared remarks is that we believe there are powerful trends from a demand standpoint around appliances, around TVs, around health and fitness and wearables and around Connected Home. The other thing I would say more broadly speaking, not specific to Q4 from a competitive standpoint, if we step back a little bit, and I could have included that in my remarks about the last 3 years, it feels -- I don't know whether all of you will agree with that, but that the competitive landscape has indeed changed a little bit in the last 3 years. There's a number of players who have decided to deemphasize or in some cases, exit their category. And so that's an important factor. It's true that it's a tough category. So here you go. The other thing that has changed in the last 3 years that is actually very notable is the fact that today, 89% of the U.S. population lives within states where one of our online competitor headquartered in Seattle now collects the sales tax. And so 3 years ago, it was less than 50%. It was probably around 40%. So that's a very material change over a period of 3 years. So altogether, from a strategic standpoint, we see these growth drivers, and I would add based on your question that the overall competitive landscape has changed somewhat in the last 3 years."

We went from analog and mass communication to much more targeted, relevant, personalized and digital communication. So as it relates to the shops-within-a-shop, one of the things, of course, is that there's not one of each in every store. So as an example, we have the ability to target the messages in a relevant fashion or we have the ability to target previous users of a particular brand and communicate the news and excitement about new product introductions. More broadly speaking, I am very excited about how these partnerships with our key vendors have evolved. It's more than just about the physical layout in the stores. These are very close partnerships because these leading tech companies invest in billions of dollars in R&D. They have some very exciting new products, of course, regularly coming to market. And the collaboration that Best Buy has with some of these -- of the foremost companies on the planet in the tech sector is very inspiring, that includes from a merchandising standpoint as well as from a marketing standpoint, and now also from a services standpoint.

So, so far, things are really progressing very nicely. The reason we don't give a specific number is again in part for competitive reasons; two, it's early days; and three, as all of you know, north of the border, the economy, which is highly dependent on raw materials and the oil sector in particular has been impacted. The exchange rate is down, which is, of course, increasing the prices of consumer electronics product, which is slowing down demand. So today, the better-than-expected retention is somewhat offset, of course, by the weakness of the Canadian economy. I think we'll be able to assess with reliability the final results once we're through the conversion and once we've upgraded the customer experience.

In some cases, it's more about the merchandising and the marketing. So there's a whole range. But it's, in general, what I would highlight is that it is -- it happens earlier on. It's more strategic, it's more integrated and it's working. That would be the summary. Now a 2-hour conference, we would need to schedule separately."

The answer is yes. And increasingly again, that's one of things we're working on with our key vendors is to make it more dramatic and more unique and more differentiated vis-à-vis any of the other retailers. So I would say yes to that question. As it relates to your second question is how does the Apple Watch momentum compared to the phone? That would be too much detail, I think, at this point. I think I would say we're very excited by again the early momentum of Apple Watch in our stores, which obviously has triggered the decision that we've made with Apple to have an accelerated and expanded rollout. So we think that's very exciting news. That's also reflective of how these partnerships -- the strength of these partnerships lead to more opportunities."

So when you think about that because it's higher dollars, so I would say that it was certainly a traffic driver. And we are thrilled to have new traffic driver this year, something very iconic. I think we can all agree the Apple Watch is certainly iconic. And having it in all 1,000 stores by the end of September is a big deal for us."

I think what you've seen these last couple of quarters is very indicative of our capabilities. And we'll continue to incrementally improve that in the coming quarters. As it relates to the second part of your question, which is the promotional discipline, this is an area we have invested in. I think if I step back over the last 3 years, we've had several phases. One is we established a Price Match policy. Two, we have invested significantly in our price competitiveness, starting with hardware, and then accessories. You've heard me talk this morning about services. We had previewed that in previous quarter. But with the launch of Geek Squad protect and support plus, that's another step forward. And then the other dimension you're talking about, which we have talked about last year, is the promotional discipline. We're applying more science and more tools to this area to make sure that the return on the promotional dollars is getting better and better. So we're continuing to see improved progress in this area, and we'll continue to deploy this as we move forward. We are a very data- and science-driven management team here on matters like that."

So the first point that you made was actually just prior to Hubert joining. So just to round-set on that fact. Since then, what we are doing, we do have a significant amount of our leases expiring. It's a substantial number. And our strategy has not changed. As we are looking at each lease, we will rationalize as we think is appropriate. Last year, we closed 5 stores. And this year, we'll walk into the year and we will be assessing the leases and determining what that would look like. But there is no announcement to be made. We consistently have said that targeting a store count, we're targeting rationalization of our footprint, particularly in our multistore markets. And to the extent that we have redundancy or stores that we feel should not be in the network long term, of course, we'll close those. We are not reluctant to close them. But right now, as we've talked about consistently, we do not have -- look at these numbers, we do not have a list of stores that we have negative cash flows or significant issues with.

So let's start with the online components, which we report online sales. It's an important part of our business. But we believe that online and mobile are a much bigger part of the business than just the online sales because it's really the front door to the store. This is where -- we all know this, this is where the customers start their research. So we are excited about the growth of online. We are excited about the increased traffic and the increased conversion rate. I think the improvements that have been made on the site and in the app over the last 3 years are just extraordinary. Now we had a long way to go, but I'm very proud now of where we are. Still continued progress will be made in the checkout, in the customer experience. Significant improvement from a supply chain standpoint has been transformative. The speed at which we are shipping now, in particular enabled by ship-from-store, has been a phenomenal transformation. Now the customers may start the journey online, they often go to the stores. Now we've always -- we believe that as a result of these trends in consumer behavior, the store experience need to be so much better, right? Because when the customer gets to the store, she has done a lot of research and she's much more educated than maybe a few years ago. And so maybe there, in some cases, we see fewer trips to the store because so much time has been spent before the store. And so the focus in the store is on the customer experience. So both -- so first, physically and with -- and together with these vendors, we've invested significantly in the physical experience in the stores. And candidly, it is so helpful. You cannot use your senses online to see the difference in picture quality of a TV or the sound quality of a headphone. You really have to go to the store. And then of course, there's the Blue Shirts. Our associates are such a formidable weapon for us. And I hope we are doing a good job this morning on thanking them on the call for their amazing performance and the entire leadership in retail. I think your question refers in particular to the comments we've made about the increased proficiency that we've made that the associates have in the stores. Even though we've taken $1 billion of cost out, we've actually increased the amount of customer-facing labor and we've increased the product knowledge, the engagement and the overall sales proficiency. So we've talked about it as IST [ph], individual sales productivity, individual sales tracking. This program has continued to be deployed, and we can measure the improvements. As a particular area of focus, our store leadership is focused on what they call, what we call value add, which is the difference between the comps in the stores and the traffic. So it's really focused on what they control in the stores. And we're seeing continued progress from that standpoint. I'm incredibly proud of what we're seeing in the stores. Now there's more to come. I think that I'd be lying to you if I was going to tell you that we are consistently excellent. We have a number of stores and number of associates that still have progress to make. But it's the combination of this better in-store performance and the excellent merchandising, the supply chain, the marketing, the service components, really the integration of all these capabilities that is resulting in these better-than-expected and better period results. So continued progress on all of these fronts."

And we believe without a question that the efforts that we have seen related to this in the store are absolutely driving these positive comps. So the implementation of IST [ph] last year, if you just go back and look at when we first started talking about IST [ph] and you look at the outcomes that we have been seeing in the retail stores because remember that the retail stores delivered significantly positive comps this quarter. So we definitely believe that there is a correlation there, and we are optimistic that we will continue to see longer-term improvements as Hubert described the proficiency that we are trying to build through this program."

I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. I will then provide highlights of the progress we are making against our priorities, and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. The results we're reporting today are strong with both significant top line and bottom line growth in the Domestic business. We believe these better-than-expected results are affirmation that our strategy of offering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" is paying off. So more specifically, Enterprise revenue grew 0.8% to $8.5 billion driven by a 3.9% increase in the Domestic segment, partially offset by the impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and 120 basis points of pressure from foreign currency. Better year-over-year performance in the Domestic segment drove a 50 basis point increase in the Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to 3.4% and a 17% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $0.49. We also returned $321 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition to $81 million in regular dividends. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales increased 2.7%, excluding the impact of installment billing, driven by continued strong performance in major appliances, large-screen televisions and mobile phones. Online comparable sales increased 17% as our investments in new capabilities continued to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. We also saw industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories, which represent 65% of our revenue, improve from a decline of 5.3% in Q1 to a decline of 1.3% in Q2. 
In the International business, while revenue declined due to store closures and foreign currency, we're seeing higher-than-expected retention from the 66 permanently closed Future Shop locations in Canada. We're now in the midst of converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations to the Best Buy brand. And much of the work and investments around building a superior multichannel customer experience are still ahead of us as we will discuss later in the call today. 
Now before I share specific highlights on our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives, I'd like to discuss a few strategic observations about what we believe has been driving our recent performance. And while recognizing the current turbulence in the financial markets, we do feel this is an opportune time to do this as it is almost 3 years to the day of my appointment and nearly 3 years since the launch of our Renew Blue strategy. 
Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services, including appliances and mobile phones, is growing. This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by macro factors, such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, Connected Home and health and wearables businesses, which we believe will remain positive catalysts in quarters to come. In addition, the increasing complexity and interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help selecting, installing, connecting integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products. 
Our second observation, which I mentioned earlier, is that the investments that we've made in our Renew Blue strategy to offer ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" are paying off. This is evidenced by the market share gains we have achieved in the NPD-tracked categories, our growth in appliances and mobile phones and the overall positive Domestic comps and expanded operating income rate that we have delivered both last year and year-to-date this year. 
Our third and final observation is that we have 3 distinct competitive advantages that help us win with customers, drive better financial results and are hard for competitors to replicate. The first competitive advantage is our ability to serve our customers online, in-store and in their home. What does this mean? We now offer a leading-edge digital shopping experience to our customers online and in our new mobile app, and we also have stores within 15 minutes of 70% of the U.S. population that not only provide advice, service and convenience to our in-store customers but also operate as local distribution centers to provide online customers with greater inventory availability and faster delivery. And through Geek Squad, we're able to provide an array of services to our customers remotely in our stores and in their home. 
The second competitive advantage is our positioning in the marketplace, which allows us to benefit from early adopters, who choose Best Buy when new, exciting technology is released. And our strong merchandising and vendor partnerships allow us to showcase the best of what is selling, which in turn positions us to outperform the sales trends within the NPD-tracked consumer electronics categories, even when they are negative. 
This leads us to our third competitive advantage, which is our vendor partnerships. Not only do we showcase the best of what our vendors offer, we're also benefiting from the material investments that several of the world's leading technology companies are making in our stores. With these partnerships, we're able to bring to life interactive technology experiences that again make the Best Buy operating model more relevant for customers. And as you'll hear later in the call, our vendor partnerships are continuing to grow, confirming that they are bringing value not only to our customers and Best Buy but also to our vendor partners. 
So now with these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss our progress on key fiscal '16 initiatives. This quarter, I'm going to start with services as it is a critical component of our Renew Blue strategy. We have significant services assets today, including our ability to assist customers in our stores remotely and in their homes. We currently have approximately 20,000 Geek Squad agents and Magnolia system designers. And we're proud of the services we offer as they generate some of our highest NPS scores. 
Now 2 things have been negatively impacting our services top line. The first is the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties. This has the impact of reducing our repair revenue, which at face value appears negative but is actually beneficial both financially and operationally. The second is the decline of our traditional warranty business. We are addressing this decline by materially renewing our service offerings to make them compelling and price-competitive. More broadly, we are ramping up our strategic investments in our services business to make it play an increasing role in our Renew Blue transformation as a differentiator, as a business driver and as a profit center in its own right. 
In this context, we have several new developments to share this quarter. They're all part of evolving this business from a traditional warranty business to a value-added services business that addresses the help our customers need. So first, in our computing and tablet service categories, beginning September 13, we're launching a range of services, including Geek Squad protect and support plus, which combines hardware support, 24/7 software support and accidental damage in one plan, priced very competitively. Second, we will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter. And additionally, we will proceed to roll out our capabilities as an Apple authorized service provider, first, with install pilots in 50 locations by holiday. Third, we'll begin to offer a range of classes to help customers take advantage of their technology products, including in our digital imaging hubs, in our Samsung Experience Shops and in our Windows Stores around the launch of Windows 10. 
In support of this services strategy, we are investing in talent, systems and processes to further enhance the quality and scope of the services we deliver to our customers. We're also continuing to drive operational and cost efficiencies, which are resulting in reduced repair costs and a higher year-over-year gross profit rate. 
I'll now turn to our progress on our merchandising initiatives. In appliances, we've rolled out 35 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year, increasing their presence to 152 of our stores. We also began the rollout of our expanded Samsung appliance experiences and expect to roll out approximately 225 Samsung open houses by the end of the year, which will be the largest dedicated in-store display of Samsung appliances in the U.S. 
In home theater, we've continued to solidify our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry-leading home theater technology, particularly ultra-high definition or 4K TVs. We've expanded our Samsung home theater stores-within-a-store from 500 at launch to 603 and the Sony home theater stores-within-a-store from 350 at launch to 372. We've also rolled out 5 of the 20 planned Magnolia Design Centers stores-within-a-store for this year, increasing their presence to 63 of our stores. And as we enter the back half of the year and as pricing of these technologies becomes even more affordable, we believe that we will continue to benefit from the customer moving to larger-screen televisions and 4K technology. 
In computing, we believe we are optimally positioned to help customers transition to the new Windows 10 operating system that was introduced at the end of July. We have a very large selection of laptops with Windows 10 already installed and a compelling in-store experience with our Windows store-within-a-store. Today, we have over 600 of these in the U.S. and expect to have over 800 by holiday. We've also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. We've already implemented approximately 350 of them and expect to upgrade a total of approximately 520 by holiday. 
The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale in bestbuy.com and in more than 100 of our stores in August. Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4, we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy mobile stores by the end of September. 
Now I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. In the second quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 17% increase in Domestic comparable online sales. This growth was driven, number one, by a significantly increased number of our online customers who received and took advantage of our free 2-day shipping promise, enabled by enhancements to our ship-from-store capability and supply chain investments that are driving improved speed, convenience and reliability; number two, by the increased visibility of open box and clearance inventory; and number three, by the expansion of online-only flash sales. We also launched several customer-facing site improvements, including expanded payment options for our customers through partnering with American Express to offer pay with points, the ability to search and shop by brand and a significantly more relevant recommendation engine. 
Turning to costs. To date, we have eliminated $100 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over the next -- over 3 years. These savings will be offset, however, by the incremental investments in our future growth initiatives, which for this year we expect to be approximately $120 million. To date, we've invested approximately $65 million to fund these initiatives, of which $35 million was in the second quarter. 
So to repeat, we are proud of the results we are reporting today. As we look forward, the combination of an opportunity-rich environment and the strength of our competitive advantages lead us to have a positive outlook about our future prospects, starting with the important back-to-school third quarter. And so of course, we'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and contributions to our success. The opportunities we have before us today are possible because of the talent and engagement of our entire team, and I am extremely proud of their performance and ability to win. 
I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our third quarter outlook."
255397,307598259,862172,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2015",2015-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5",1341,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion exceeded our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected overall performance in our Domestic business in addition to higher sales retention from previously closed stores in our Canadian brand consolidation. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% also exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate in our computing business, a higher gross profit rate in our services business due to a periodic profit-sharing payment from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio. As Hubert said, we are extremely proud of the teams who drove these better-than-expected results. 
I will now talk to you about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.8% to $8.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.49, driven primarily by stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business from higher sales volume, improved gross profit rates and a $0.04 periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment that we just discussed. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from a higher effective income tax rate due to a discrete tax benefit in Q2 fiscal '15 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.9% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2.7%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 110 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment in services. Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 17% driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 8.6% versus 7.7% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 22%, this year's online growth rate of 17% was lower, primarily due to lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. This ship-from-store impact will continue through the back half of this year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in major appliances, televisions, mobile phones and health and fitness was partially offset by ongoing declines in tablets. In services, revenues declined 13.1%. As Hubert discussed earlier, this is primarily due to lower repair revenue and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates in our traditional warranty business. Since we expect this trend of lower repair revenue to continue, which is a positive, comparable sales in services are expected to continue to decline through the back half of this year. 
In our International segment, revenue declined 25.6% to $650 million due to the loss of revenue associated with the closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,200 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and Canadian consumer electronics industry. 
Turning now to gross profits. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 24.4%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 24.6%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity; a rate improvement in computing hardware; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a 25 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment we previously discussed; and a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category. These increases were partially offset by a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher-priced iconic mobile phones, which deliver higher gross profit dollars but carry a lower gross profit rate. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 22.9%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $57 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 20.6% of revenue, an increase of $114 million or 70 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by investments in future growth initiatives in addition to SG&A inflation and higher incentive compensation. International non-GAAP SG&A was $170 million or 26.2% of revenue, a decrease of $57 million but a rate increase of 20 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 20 basis point increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred approximately $0.02 of negative non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first half of the year, which was lower than expected due to retaining sales at a higher-than-expected rate. As such, we are reducing our estimated impact of the consolidation to a range of $0.10 to $0.17 in fiscal 2016 versus our original estimate of a negative $0.10 to $0.20 as the retention rate trends are expected to continue in the back half of the year. By quarter, this expectation is broken down as follows: the negative $0.02 per share that we incurred in the first half, a negative $0.04 to $0.06 per share in Q3 and a negative $0.04 to $0.09 per share in Q4. Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and more profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the second quarter, we returned over $400 million in cash to our shareholders, $321 million through share repurchases and $81 million in regular dividends. In addition, in the last 2 weeks, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded Best Buy's debt rating by one notch. Moody's raised their rating to Baa1 and Standard & Poor's raised theirs to BB+. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, our competitive advantages and strong execution give us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry, which bodes well for us as we enter the third quarter. It is difficult to know, though, if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending. To date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations. So as such, our outlook assumes that there will be no material changes in consumer spending in the third quarter. 
With that said, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q3 fiscal '16 is as follows. In the Domestic business, we are expecting flat to low single-digit revenue growth and an approximately flat operating income rate driven by a higher gross profit rate, offset by increased SG&A due to inflation and growth-related investments. In the International business, due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation and foreign currency, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%. 
With these expectations, which assume continued strength in our Domestic business, offset by the near-term impact of Canada, at the Enterprise level, we expect a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and an operating income rate growth of flat to negative 20 basis points. This includes an approximately 15 basis point negative year-over-year impact in the Domestic business due to an $11.5 million or $0.02 per share legal settlement that we received in Q3 of last year that will not recur this year. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 39% to 40% versus 38.1% last year, which could result in a negative $0.01 year-over-year non-GAAP diluted EPS impact in Q3 fiscal '16. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we are seeing sustained growth now over many, many quarters in our appliance business. This is driven by, number one, the markets. The housing recovery continues to be strong, and you're seeing the customers equip their new house or replace their old appliances. It's a very positive factor. And then second, investments in the appliance sector continue to be very strong. The deployment of the Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store in particular is helping us drive better customer experience and market share in particular, not only in the extreme high end but also in the better and best part of the market, which is where a lot of the interesting action is. We're also investing in the customer experience from an appliance delivery and installation standpoint. So these are very fundamental and sustained improvements. Now Anthony, this may fluctuate a little bit quarter-after-quarter, but we do expect continued traction including given the competitive environments that I won't elaborate on.

So we see a number of very strong drivers of performance getting into the back half of the year. Now of course, as we get into these parts of the cycle, as you would expect, the margins are not going to continue at the same level. So factor this in, but it's a very powerful cycle."

The other thing I would say more broadly speaking, not specific to Q4 from a competitive standpoint, if we step back a little bit, and I could have included that in my remarks about the last 3 years, it feels -- I don't know whether all of you will agree with that, but that the competitive landscape has indeed changed a little bit in the last 3 years. There's a number of players who have decided to deemphasize or, in some cases, exit their category. And so that's an important factor. It's true that it's a tough category. So here you go. The other thing that has changed in the last 3 years that is actually very notable is the fact that today, 89% of the U.S. population lives within states where one of our online competitor headquartered in Seattle now collects the sales tax. And so 3 years ago, it was less than 50%. It was probably around 40%. So that's a very material change over a period of 3 years. So altogether, from a strategic standpoint, we see these growth drivers, and I would add based on your question that the competitive landscape has changed somewhat in the last 3 years."

So as an example, we have the ability to target the messages in a relevant fashion or we have the ability to target previous users of a particular brand and communicate the news and excitement about new product introductions. More broadly speaking, I am very excited about how these partnerships with our key vendors have evolved. It's more than just about the physical layout in the stores. These are very close partnerships because these leading tech companies invest billions of dollars in R&D. They have some very exciting new products, of course, regularly coming to market. And the collaboration that Best Buy has with some of these -- of the foremost companies on the planet in the tech sector is very inspiring, that includes from a merchandising standpoint as well as from a marketing standpoint, and now also from a services standpoint. And so yes, it's an entire collaboration. And I think we can attribute some of our performance to this more targeted, more relevant communication. Our customer database, Athena, has been now busy at work. Athena is very busy at our company over the last 1 or 2 years. And we had always said it would be a gradual implementation and exploitation.

I mean, David, in general, we are very pleased with the way the Canadian strategy is being implemented. Our team -- this was heavy lifting: consolidating 2 brands into 1, closing 66 stores, converting 65 stores, and then investing in the customer experience. So, so far, things are really progressing very nicely. The reason we don't give a specific number is again in part for competitive reasons; two, it's early days; and three, as all of you know, north of the border, the economy, which is highly dependent on raw materials, and the oil sector in particular has been impacted. The exchange rate is down, which is, of course, increasing the prices of consumer electronics product, which is slowing down demand. So today, the better-than-expected retention is somewhat offset, of course, by the weakness of the Canadian economy. I think we'll be able to assess with reliability the final results once we're through the conversion and once we've upgraded the customer experience. But altogether, it was obviously the right thing to do and it's progressing quite nicely in a somewhat challenged Canadian economy."

I think I would say we're very excited by, again, the early momentum of Apple Watch in our stores, which obviously has triggered the decision that we've made with Apple to have an accelerated and expanded rollout.

I think we can all agree the Apple Watch is certainly iconic. And having it in all 1,000 stores by the end of September is a big deal for us."

I think what you've seen these last couple of quarters is very indicative of our capabilities. And we'll continue to incrementally improve that in the coming quarters. As it relates to the second part of your question, which is the promotional discipline, this is an area we have invested in. I think if I step back over the last 3 years, we've had several phases. One is we established a Price Match policy. Two, we have invested significantly in our price competitiveness, starting with hardware, and then accessories. You've heard me talk this morning about services. We had previewed that in previous quarter. But with the launch of Geek Squad protect and support plus, that's another step forward. And then the other dimension you're talking about, which we had talked about last year, is the promotional discipline. We're applying more science and more tools to this area to make sure that the return on the promotional dollars is getting better and better. So we're continuing to see improved progress in this area, and we'll continue to deploy this as we move forward. We are a very data- and science-driven management team here on matters like that."

So the first point that you made was actually just prior to Hubert joining. So just to round-set on that fact. Since then, what we are doing, we do have a significant amount of our leases expiring. It's a substantial number. And our strategy has not changed. As we are looking at each lease, we will rationalize as we think is appropriate. Last year, we closed 5 stores. And this year, we'll walk into the year and we will be assessing the leases and determining what that would look like. But there is no announcement to be made. We consistently have said that targeting a store count, we're targeting rationalization of our footprint, particularly in our multistore markets. And to the extent that we have redundancy or stores that we feel should not be in the network long term, of course, we'll close those. We are not reluctant to close them. But right now, as we've talked about consistently, we do not have -- look at these numbers, we do not have a list of stores that we have negative cash flows or significant issues with.

So let's start with the online components, which we report online sales. It's an important part of our business. But we believe that online and mobile are a much bigger part of the business than just the online sales because it's really the front door to the store. This is where -- we all know this, this is where the customers start their research. So we are excited about the growth of online. We are excited by the increased traffic and the increased conversion rate. I think the improvements that have been made on the site and in the app over the last 3 years are just extraordinary. Now we have a long way to go, but I'm very proud now of where we are. Still continued progress to be made in the checkout, in the customer experience. Significant improvement from a supply chain standpoint has been transformative. The speed at which we are shipping now, in particular enabled by ship-from-store, has been a phenomenal transformation. Now the customers may start the journey online. They often go to the stores. Now we've always -- we believe that as a result of these trends in consumer behavior, the store experience need to be so much better, right? Because when the customer gets to the store, she has done a lot of research and she's much more educated than maybe a few years ago. And so maybe there, in some cases, we see fewer trips to the store because so much time has been spent before the store. And so the focus in the store is on the customer experience. So both -- so first, physically and with -- and together with these vendors, we've invested significantly in the physical experience in the stores. And candidly, it is so helpful. You cannot use your senses online to see the difference in picture quality of a TV or the sound quality of a headphone. You really have to go to the store. And then of course, there's the Blue Shirts. Our associates are such a formidable weapon for us. And I hope we are doing a good job this morning on thanking them on the call for their amazing performance and the entire leadership in retail. I think your question refers in particular to the comments we've made about the increased proficiency that we've made -- that the associates have in the stores. Even though we've taken $1 billion of cost out, we've actually increased the amount of customer-facing labor and we've increased the product knowledge, the engagement and the overall sales proficiency. So we've talked about it as IST, individual sales productivity, individual sales tracking. This program has continued to be deployed, and we can measure the improvements. As a particular area of focus, our store leadership is focused on what they call, what we call value add, which is the difference between the comps in the stores and the traffic. So it's really focused on what they control in the stores. And we're seeing continued progress from that standpoint. I'm incredibly proud of what we're seeing in the stores. Now there's more to come. I think that I'd be lying to you if I was going to tell you that we are consistently excellent. We have a number of stores and number of associates that still have progress to make. But it's the combination of this better in-store performance and the excellent merchandising, the supply chain, the marketing, the service components, really the integration of all these capabilities that is resulting in these better-than-expected and better period results. So continued progress on all of these fronts."

And we believe, without a question, that the efforts that we have seen related to this in the store are absolutely driving these positive comps. So the implementation of IST last year, if you just go back and look at when we first started talking about IST and you look at the outcomes that we have been seeing in the retail stores, because remember that the retail stores delivered significantly positive comps this quarter. So we definitely believe that there is a correlation there, and we are optimistic that we will continue to see longer-term improvements as Hubert described the proficiency that we are trying to build through this program."

I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. I will then provide highlights of the progress we are making against our priorities, and then turn the call over",2096,"Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. I will then provide highlights of the progress we are making against our priorities, and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
So first, our financial results. The results we're reporting today are strong with both significant top line and bottom line growth in the Domestic business. We believe these better-than-expected results are affirmation that our strategy of offering ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" is paying off. So more specifically, Enterprise revenue grew 0.8% to $8.5 billion driven by a 3.9% increase in the Domestic segment, partially offset by the impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and 120 basis points of pressure from foreign currency. Better year-over-year performance in the Domestic segment drove a 50 basis point increase in the Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to 3.4% and a 17% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $0.49. We also returned $321 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition to $81 million in regular dividends. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales increased 2.7%, excluding the impact of installment billing, driven by continued strong performance in major appliances, large-screen televisions and mobile phones. Online comparable sales increased 17% as our investments in new capabilities continued to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. We also saw industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories, which represent 65% of our revenue, improve from a decline of 5.3% in Q1 to a decline of 1.3% in Q2. 
In the International business, while revenue declined due to store closures and foreign currency, we're seeing higher-than-expected retention from the 66 permanently closed Future Shop locations in Canada. We're now in the midst of converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations to the Best Buy brand. And much of the work and investments around building a superior multichannel customer experience are still ahead of us as we will discuss later in the call today. 
Now before I share specific highlights on our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives, I'd like to discuss a few strategic observations about what we believe has been driving our recent performance. And while recognizing the current turbulence in the financial markets, we do feel this is an opportune time to do this as it is almost 3 years to the day of my appointment and nearly 3 years since the launch of our Renew Blue strategy. 
Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services, including appliances and mobile phones, is growing. This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by macro factors, such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, Connected Home and health and wearables businesses, which we believe will remain positive catalysts in quarters to come. In addition, the increasing complexity and interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help selecting, installing, connecting integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products. 
Our second observation, which I mentioned earlier, is that the investments that we've made in our Renew Blue strategy to offer ""Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices"" are paying off. This is evidenced by the market share gains we have achieved in the NPD-tracked categories, our growth in appliances and mobile phones and the overall positive Domestic comps and expanded operating income rate that we have delivered both last year and year-to-date this year. 
Our third and final observation is that we have 3 distinct competitive advantages that help us win with customers, drive better financial results and are hard for competitors to replicate. The first competitive advantage is our ability to serve our customers online, in-store and in their home. What does this mean? We now offer a leading-edge digital shopping experience to our customers online and in our new mobile app, and we also have stores within 15 minutes of 70% of the U.S. population that not only provide advice, service and convenience to our in-store customers but also operate as local distribution centers to provide online customers with greater inventory availability and faster delivery. And through Geek Squad, we're able to provide an array of services to our customers remotely in our stores and in their home. 
The second competitive advantage is our positioning in the marketplace, which allows us to benefit from early adopters, who choose Best Buy when new, exciting technology is released. And our strong merchandising and vendor partnerships allow us to showcase the best of what is selling, which in turn positions us to outperform the sales trends within the NPD-tracked consumer electronics categories, even when they are negative. 
This leads us to our third competitive advantage, which is our vendor partnerships. Not only do we showcase the best of what our vendors offer, we're also benefiting from the material investments that several of the world's leading technology companies are making in our stores. With these partnerships, we're able to bring to life interactive technology experiences that again make the Best Buy operating model more relevant for customers. And as you'll hear later in the call, our vendor partnerships are continuing to grow, confirming that they are bringing value not only to our customers and Best Buy but also to our vendor partners. 
So now with these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss our progress on key fiscal '16 initiatives. This quarter, I'm going to start with services as it is a critical component of our Renew Blue strategy. We have significant services assets today, including our ability to assist customers in our stores remotely and in their homes. We currently have approximately 20,000 Geek Squad agents and Magnolia system designers. And we're proud of the services we offer as they generate some of our highest NPS scores. 
Now 2 things have been negatively impacting our services top line. The first is the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties. This has the impact of reducing our repair revenue, which at face value appears negative but is actually beneficial both financially and operationally. The second is the decline of our traditional warranty business. We are addressing this decline by materially renewing our service offerings to make them compelling and price-competitive. More broadly, we are ramping up our strategic investments in our services business to make it play an increasing role in our Renew Blue transformation as a differentiator, as a business driver and as a profit center in its own right. 
In this context, we have several new developments to share this quarter. They're all part of evolving this business from a traditional warranty business to a value-added services business that addresses the help our customers need. So first, in our computing and tablet service categories, beginning September 13, we're launching a range of services, including Geek Squad protect and support plus, which combines hardware support, 24/7 software support and accidental damage in one plan, priced very competitively. Second, we will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter. And additionally, we will proceed to roll out our capabilities as an Apple authorized service provider, first, with install pilots in 50 locations by holiday. Third, we'll begin to offer a range of classes to help customers take advantage of their technology products, including in our digital imaging hubs, in our Samsung Experience Shops and in our Windows Stores around the launch of Windows 10. 
In support of this services strategy, we are investing in talent, systems and processes to further enhance the quality and scope of the services we deliver to our customers. We're also continuing to drive operational and cost efficiencies, which are resulting in reduced repair costs and a higher year-over-year gross profit rate. 
I'll now turn to our progress on our merchandising initiatives. In appliances, we've rolled out 35 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year, increasing their presence to 152 of our stores. We also began the rollout of our expanded Samsung appliance experiences and expect to roll out approximately 225 Samsung open houses by the end of the year, which will be the largest dedicated in-store display of Samsung appliances in the U.S. 
In home theater, we've continued to solidify our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry-leading home theater technology, particularly ultra-high definition or 4K TVs. We've expanded our Samsung home theater stores-within-a-store from 500 at launch to 603 and the Sony home theater stores-within-a-store from 350 at launch to 372. We've also rolled out 5 of the 20 planned Magnolia Design Centers stores-within-a-store for this year, increasing their presence to 63 of our stores. And as we enter the back half of the year and as pricing of these technologies becomes even more affordable, we believe that we will continue to benefit from the customer moving to larger-screen televisions and 4K technology. 
In computing, we believe we are optimally positioned to help customers transition to the new Windows 10 operating system that was introduced at the end of July. We have a very large selection of laptops with Windows 10 already installed and a compelling in-store experience with our Windows store-within-a-store. Today, we have over 600 of these in the U.S. and expect to have over 800 by holiday. We've also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. We've already implemented approximately 350 of them and expect to upgrade a total of approximately 520 by holiday. 
The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale in bestbuy.com and in more than 100 of our stores in August. Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4, we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy mobile stores by the end of September. 
Now I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. In the second quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 17% increase in Domestic comparable online sales. This growth was driven, number one, by a significantly increased number of our online customers who received and took advantage of our free 2-day shipping promise, enabled by enhancements to our ship-from-store capability and supply chain investments that are driving improved speed, convenience and reliability; number two, by the increased visibility of open box and clearance inventory; and number three, by the expansion of online-only flash sales. We also launched several customer-facing site improvements, including expanded payment options for our customers through partnering with American Express to offer pay with points, the ability to search and shop by brand and a significantly more relevant recommendation engine. 
Turning to costs. To date, we have eliminated $100 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over the next -- over 3 years. These savings will be offset, however, by the incremental investments in our future growth initiatives, which for this year we expect to be approximately $120 million. To date, we've invested approximately $65 million to fund these initiatives, of which $35 million was in the second quarter. 
So to repeat, we are proud of the results we are reporting today. As we look forward, the combination of an opportunity-rich environment and the strength of our competitive advantages lead us to have a positive outlook about our future prospects, starting with the important back-to-school third quarter. And so of course, we'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and contributions to our success. The opportunities we have before us today are possible because of the talent and engagement of our entire team, and I am extremely proud of their performance and ability to win. 
I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our third quarter outlook."
255397,307598259,862274,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2015",2015-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5",1341,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion exceeded our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected overall performance in our Domestic business in addition to higher sales retention from previously closed stores in our Canadian brand consolidation. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% also exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate in our computing business, a higher gross profit rate in our services business due to a periodic profit-sharing payment from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio. As Hubert said, we are extremely proud of the teams who drove these better-than-expected results. 
I will now talk to you about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.8% to $8.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.49, driven primarily by stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business from higher sales volume, improved gross profit rates and a $0.04 periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment that we just discussed. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from a higher effective income tax rate due to a discrete tax benefit in Q2 fiscal '15 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.9% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2.7%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 110 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment in services. Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 17% driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 8.6% versus 7.7% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 22%, this year's online growth rate of 17% was lower, primarily due to lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. This ship-from-store impact will continue through the back half of this year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in major appliances, televisions, mobile phones and health and fitness was partially offset by ongoing declines in tablets. In services, revenues declined 13.1%. As Hubert discussed earlier, this is primarily due to lower repair revenue and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates in our traditional warranty business. Since we expect this trend of lower repair revenue to continue, which is a positive, comparable sales in services are expected to continue to decline through the back half of this year. 
In our International segment, revenue declined 25.6% to $650 million due to the loss of revenue associated with the closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,200 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and Canadian consumer electronics industry. 
Turning now to gross profits. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 24.4%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 24.6%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity; a rate improvement in computing hardware; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a 25 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment we previously discussed; and a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category. These increases were partially offset by a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher-priced iconic mobile phones, which deliver higher gross profit dollars but carry a lower gross profit rate. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 22.9%. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $57 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 20.6% of revenue, an increase of $114 million or 70 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by investments in future growth initiatives in addition to SG&A inflation and higher incentive compensation. International non-GAAP SG&A was $170 million or 26.2% of revenue, a decrease of $57 million but a rate increase of 20 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 20 basis point increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred approximately $0.02 of negative non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first half of the year, which was lower than expected due to retaining sales at a higher-than-expected rate. As such, we are reducing our estimated impact of the consolidation to a range of $0.10 to $0.17 in fiscal 2016 versus our original estimate of a negative $0.10 to $0.20 as the retention rate trends are expected to continue in the back half of the year. By quarter, this expectation is broken down as follows: the negative $0.02 per share that we incurred in the first half, a negative $0.04 to $0.06 per share in Q3 and a negative $0.04 to $0.09 per share in Q4. Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and more profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the second quarter, we returned over $400 million in cash to our shareholders, $321 million through share repurchases and $81 million in regular dividends. In addition, in the last 2 weeks, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded Best Buy's debt rating by one notch. Moody's raised their rating to Baa1 and Standard & Poor's raised theirs to BB+. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, our competitive advantages and strong execution give us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry, which bodes well for us as we enter the third quarter. It is difficult to know, though, if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending. To date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations. So as such, our outlook assumes that there will be no material changes in consumer spending in the third quarter. 
With that said, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q3 fiscal '16 is as follows. In the Domestic business, we are expecting flat to low single-digit revenue growth and an approximately flat operating income rate driven by a higher gross profit rate, offset by increased SG&A due to inflation and growth-related investments. In the International business, due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation and foreign currency, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%. 
With these expectations, which assume continued strength in our Domestic business, offset by the near-term impact of Canada, at the Enterprise level, we expect a flat to negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and an operating income rate growth of flat to negative 20 basis points. This includes an approximately 15 basis point negative year-over-year impact in the Domestic business due to an $11.5 million or $0.02 per share legal settlement that we received in Q3 of last year that will not recur this year. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 39% to 40% versus 38.1% last year, which could result in a negative $0.01 year-over-year non-GAAP diluted EPS impact in Q3 fiscal '16.

The other thing I would say more broadly speaking, not specific to Q4 from a competitive standpoint, if we step back a little bit, and I could have included that in my remarks about the last 3 years, it feels -- I don't know whether all of you will agree with that, but that the competitive landscape has indeed changed a little bit in the last 3 years. There's a number of players who have decided to deemphasize or, in some cases, exit their category. And so that's an important factor. It's true that it's a tough category. So here you go. The other thing that has changed in the last 3 years that is actually very notable is the fact that today, 89% of the U.S. population lives within states where one of our online competitor headquartered in Seattle now collects the sales tax. And so 3 years ago, it was less than 50%. It was probably around 40%. So that's a very material change over a period of 3 years. So altogether, from a strategic standpoint, we see these growth drivers, and I would add based on your question that the competitive landscape has changed somewhat in the last 3 years."

We've commented on marketing on every one of our previous call. We've had a very material transformation of our marketing efforts in the last 3 years with the headline being, of course, more personalized. We went from analog and mass communication to much more targeted, relevant, personalized and digital communication. So as it relates to the shops-within-a-shop, one of the things, of course, is that there's not one of each in every store. So as an example, we have the ability to target the messages in a relevant fashion or we have the ability to target previous users of a particular brand and communicate the news and excitement about new product introductions. More broadly speaking, I am very excited about how these partnerships with our key vendors have evolved. It's more than just about the physical layout in the stores. These are very close partnerships because these leading tech companies invest billions of dollars in R&D. They have some very exciting new products, of course, regularly coming to market. And the collaboration that Best Buy has with some of these -- of the foremost companies on the planet in the tech sector is very inspiring, that includes from a merchandising standpoint as well as from a marketing standpoint, and now also from a services standpoint. And so yes, it's an entire collaboration. And I think we can attribute some of our performance to this more targeted, more relevant communication. Our customer database, Athena, has been now busy at work. Athena is very busy at our company over the last 1 or 2 years. And we had always said it would be a gradual implementation and exploitation. And I think we are getting better and better at this."

I mean, David, in general, we are very pleased with the way the Canadian strategy is being implemented. Our team -- this was heavy lifting: consolidating 2 brands into 1, closing 66 stores, converting 65 stores, and then investing in the customer experience. So, so far, things are really progressing very nicely. The reason we don't give a specific number is again in part for competitive reasons; two, it's early days; and three, as all of you know, north of the border, the economy, which is highly dependent on raw materials, and the oil sector in particular has been impacted. The exchange rate is down, which is, of course, increasing the prices of consumer electronics product, which is slowing down demand. So today, the better-than-expected retention is somewhat offset, of course, by the weakness of the Canadian economy. I think we'll be able to assess with reliability the final results once we're through the conversion and once we've upgraded the customer experience. But altogether, it was obviously the right thing to do and it's progressing quite nicely in a somewhat challenged Canadian economy."

As it relates to the second part of your question, which is the promotional discipline, this is an area we have invested in. I think if I step back over the last 3 years, we've had several phases. One is we established a Price Match policy. Two, we have invested significantly in our price competitiveness, starting with hardware, and then accessories. You've heard me talk this morning about services. We had previewed that in previous quarter. But with the launch of Geek Squad protect and support plus, that's another step forward. And then the other dimension you're talking about, which we had talked about last year, is the promotional discipline. We're applying more science and more tools to this area to make sure that the return on the promotional dollars is getting better and better.

And this year, we'll walk into the year and we will be assessing the leases and determining what that would look like. But there is no announcement to be made. We consistently have said that targeting a store count, we're targeting rationalization of our footprint, particularly in our multistore markets. And to the extent that we have redundancy or stores that we feel should not be in the network long term, of course, we'll close those. We are not reluctant to close them.

So let's start with the online components, which we report online sales. It's an important part of our business. But we believe that online and mobile are a much bigger part of the business than just the online sales because it's really the front door to the store. This is where -- we all know this, this is where the customers start their research. So we are excited about the growth of online. We are excited by the increased traffic and the increased conversion rate. I think the improvements that have been made on the site and in the app over the last 3 years are just extraordinary. Now we have a long way to go, but I'm very proud now of where we are. Still continued progress to be made in the checkout, in the customer experience. Significant improvement from a supply chain standpoint has been transformative. The speed at which we are shipping now, in particular enabled by ship-from-store, has been a phenomenal transformation. Now the customers may start the journey online. They often go to the stores. Now we've always -- we believe that as a result of these trends in consumer behavior, the store experience need to be so much better, right? Because when the customer gets to the store, she has done a lot of research and she's much more educated than maybe a few years ago. And so maybe there, in some cases, we see fewer trips to the store because so much time has been spent before the store. And so the focus in the store is on the customer experience. So both -- so first, physically and with -- and together with these vendors, we've invested significantly in the physical experience in the stores. And candidly, it is so helpful. You cannot use your senses online to see the difference in picture quality of a TV or the sound quality of a headphone. You really have to go to the store. And then of course, there's the Blue Shirts. Our associates are such a formidable weapon for us. And I hope we are doing a good job this morning on thanking them on the call for their amazing performance and the entire leadership in retail. I think your question refers in particular to the comments we've made about the increased proficiency that we've made -- that the associates have in the stores. Even though we've taken $1 billion of cost out, we've actually increased the amount of customer-facing labor and we've increased the product knowledge, the engagement and the overall sales proficiency. So we've talked about it as IST, individual sales productivity, individual sales tracking. This program has continued to be deployed, and we can measure the improvements. As a particular area of focus, our store leadership is focused on what they call, what we call value add, which is the difference between the comps in the stores and the traffic. So it's really focused on what they control in the stores. And we're seeing continued progress from that standpoint. I'm incredibly proud of what we're seeing in the stores. Now there's more to come. I think that I'd be lying to you if I was going to tell you that we are consistently excellent. We have a number of stores and number of associates that still have progress to make. But it's the combination of this better in-store performance and the excellent merchandising, the supply chain, the marketing, the service components, really the integration of all these capabilities that is resulting in these better-than-expected and better period results. So continued progress on all of these fronts."

And we believe, without a question, that the efforts that we have seen related to this in the store are absolutely driving these positive comps. So the implementation of IST last year, if you just go back and look at when we first started talking about IST and you look at the outcomes that we have been seeing in the retail stores, because remember that the retail stores delivered significantly positive comps this quarter. So we definitely believe that there is a correlation there, and we are optimistic that we will continue to see longer-term improvements as Hubert described the proficiency that we are trying to build through this program."

I will begin today with our third quarter results and an overview of the progress we're continuing to make against our priorities. I will then provide highlights of our holiday plans before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
First, our Q3 results. In summary, we have delivered another quarter of Domestic comparable sales growth and operating income expansion. At the Enterprise level, on revenue of $8.8 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate by 40 basis points to 2.8% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.07 to $0.41, an increase of 21%. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales, excluding the impact of installment billing, increased 0.5%. This increase was the result of growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen televisions, partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services. 
Online comparable sales increased 18% as our new mobile sites and enhanced dot-com capability continue to drive higher conversion rates and increased traffic. I note that during Q3, industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories were down 4.3%. 
In the International business, we continue to see the ongoing revenue impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation store closures, foreign currency and softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. However, the stronger product mix and a more effective promotional strategy have resulted in better-than-expected profitability. 
I would now like to discuss our progress on our key priority, starting with merchandising. In Appliances, we've completed our planned rollout of Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store for the year, adding 59 stores for a total of 176. We also rolled out 225 Samsung open house appliance experiences, and with 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Appliances, we believe the investments we're making in this business are helping us win in the market. 
Furthermore, the appliance delivery and installation investments we have made this year are also driving significant improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. In home theater, with our 630 Samsung and 380 Sony stores-within-a-store and our 78 Magnolia Design Centers, we have continued to expand our industry-leading experience for customers to discover, learn about and enjoy home theater technology, especially 4K TVs. This is a significant competitive advantage for us as 4K unit sales are expected to materially increase in the fourth quarter. 
In computing, we rolled out more than 150 additional Windows stores in the quarter -- in the third quarter and now have over 800. We also updated more than 130 of our Apple stores-within-a-store and now have 500 latest-generation Apple stores-within-a-store. 
In mobile phones, we added 225 Verizon and 225 AT&T stores-within-a-store. These shops feature highly trained specialists, who provide access to the carrier's products and services and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
Additionally, in mobile, we've added the ability for customers to buy installment billing plans online for Sprint. At this time, we are the only retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. 
Turning to digital. Our investments continue to drive results as illustrated by the 18% increase in Domestic online sales. In the third quarter, we provided free 2-day shipping to a significantly increased number of our online customers. We further benefited from the visibility and searchability of open box and clearance inventory. We expanded online-only flash sales. 
We introduced Blue Assist, a new feature in our highly rated mobile app, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call, e-mail or through scheduling of Blue Shirts in store. We also launched a dedicated Windows 10 online experience that showcases the functionalities of Windows 10, offers customer training and highlights new Windows 10 devices. In addition, right after the end of the quarter, we launched the Best Buy app for iPad. 
Turning to marketing. Our marketing campaigns help drive a strong back-to-school performance. In the third quarter, we continued to shift our focus to social media campaigns at Millennials. We continue to increase the number of addressable e-mails, and we continue to improve the customer click-through rate to our website to enhance targeted marketing programs, enabled by our Athena customer database. 
In Services, as we discussed last quarter, we began increasing our investments to support the expanded role we're expecting Services to play in our Renew Blue transformation. The first of these investments was the September 13 launch of our new Geek Squad Services in computing in tablets. We also began setting AppleCare and piloting our new Apple-authorized service provider capabilities in more than 60 stores. 
Like AppleCare, our new Geek Squad Services are much more than extended warranties. They include providing 24/7 support to our customers and helping them take advantage of their technology products. We believe this focus will result in higher NPS scores and increase the attach rates over time. 
Initially, however, we are expecting the price investments related to these rollouts to have an approximately $40 million or 25 basis points negative gross profit rate impact in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to costs. To date this year, we've eliminated a total of $110 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over 3 years. These savings will continue to be offset, however, by the incremental SG&A investment in our future growth initiatives, which have totaled approximately $85 million so far this year, of which $20 million was in the third quarter. 
We do, however, now expect the SG&A investment to reach only $100 million this year versus the $120 million we discussed last quarter due to reducing the SG&A investment plan to partially fund the $40 million investment in Services pricing that I just discussed. 
Let me now turn to holiday. We are excited by what we are offering and delivering to our customers during this holiday shopping season. First, we have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, Appliances, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday season. 
Second, we have built some terrific new capabilities since last year, including number one, a range of new digital capabilities, especially Blue Assist that I described earlier; number two, an additional 1,100 stores-within-a-store, which come on top of the over 3,700 we had a year ago; number three, the increasing expertise and proficiency of our sales people; number four, our enhanced multi-channel delivery capabilities, illustrated by faster shipping, which is enabled by ship-from-store and a better in-store pickup experience; number five, the optimization of our supply chain to enable earlier store replenishments and higher order fill rates; and number six, a range of Services offered to our customers, including free Geek Squad set up on top tech gifts and the ability for customers to give a gift of a Geek Squad agent's time. 
Also, from a marketing perspective, we believe we are entering the quarter with a high-performing media campaign, a significantly greater social media presence and more refined personalization capabilities through our investment in our Athena database. We, of course, recognize that we are up against a strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year and that the NPD industry decline that we saw in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, may continue throughout this year's fourth quarter. We also made incremental investments in Services pricing and SG&A that are putting pressure on our fourth quarter earnings outlook, which Sharon will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Now one thing we are certain about is our team's ability to execute exceptionally well throughout the holiday. We're going into the holiday clear on our priorities and our plan and with a better trained, engaged and most importantly, highly determined team. I am grateful for what they've accomplished so far this year and extremely proud of their capabilities and passion to win. I know that they are ready to deliver an outstanding performance this holiday. 
I'll now turn the call to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook."
255397,315848614,906253,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 19, 2015",2015-11-19,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expec",1597,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.8% exceeded our expectations due to a Domestic $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed service plan portfolio and better-than-expected profitability in our International business. 
Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 37.1% versus our expectations of 39% to 40%, resulting in additional $0.01 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. 
Again, Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 2.4%, driven primarily by the Canadian brand consolidation, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian economy. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 21% to $0.41. This increase was primarily driven by a stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business and the $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit that I just discussed. These increases were is partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact of a Canadian brand consolidation and the lapping of a prior year inventory related legal settlement of $0.02 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 0.5%, excluding the benefit from installment billing; an estimated 30 basis point benefit associated with installment billing; and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. 
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.3%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rate. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 130 basis points to 8.8% versus 7.5% last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, major Appliances, health and wearables and large-screen television was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and Services. 
In Services, comparable revenue declined 11.1%, almost entirely due to lower repair revenue; and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates of our traditional warranty plan. As we explained last quarter, the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranty has had the impact of reducing our repair revenue. While at face value, this appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because this repair revenue produces very little profit, and it is contributing to the positive performance of the externally managed portfolio. 
Additionally, in Q3, as Hubert discussed, we increased our investment in Services pricing as we expand and improve our price competitiveness in this category, particularly in computing and tablet. The impact of this price investment is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and throughout next year, of course. 
As we are discussing Services, I'd like to take a moment to provide more insight into the periodic profit-sharing benefits we are receiving from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio as they have positively impacted our gross profit rate and earnings the last 2 quarters, and we are expecting a positive 55 basis point impact in Q4. These periodic benefits have been driven by substantial changes we have made to our insured warranty plan from both a plan design and cost-to-fulfill perspective. The portfolio has also seen an overall industry reduction in frequency of claims. All of these positive loss drivers have resulted in an overall lower-than-expected cost of our extended service plans, and we contractually share in that outperformance. As these periodic benefits are based on actual claims history of the externally managed portfolio, however, it is difficult to estimate any future potential impact, but we do not currently expect to see the same level of periodic profit-sharing benefits in fiscal '17. 
Now I will continue with our Q3 results. In our International segment, revenue declined 29.9% to $729 million due to the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry overall. 
Turning now to gross profits. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.9%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 24.1%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, which we will begin lapping in Q4; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category; a greater portion of vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A; and a 20 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. These increase were partially offset by the lapping of the 15 basis point prior year inventory related legal settlement I just discussed. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.4%. While both Canada and Mexico had higher year-over-year gross profit rates, a higher mix of sales from our Mexico business, which carries a lower gross profit rate, drove the 20 basis point International rate decline. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 21.1% of revenue, an increase of $4 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.9% of revenues, an increase of $67 million or 60 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the flow-through of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $171 million or 23.5% of revenue, a decrease of $63 million but a rate increase of 100 basis points. This dollar increase is primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. The 100 basis point increase is driven by the year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred a better-than-expected negative impact of $0.02 of non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter. This was the result of a more effective promotional strategy, partially offset by a weaker-than-expected Canadian economy and consumer electronics markets and from a lesser extent, lower costs from our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year. 
As such, we are narrowing our estimated EPS impact of the consolidation this year to a range of negative $0.10 to $0.12 versus our previous estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.17. This expectation is broken down as follows: the negative $0.04 that we've incurred in the first 9 months of this year and a negative $0.06 to $0.08 in Q4. 
Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the third quarter, we returned over $140 million in cash to our shareholders, $64 million through share repurchases and $79 million in regular dividends, bringing our year-to-date total cash returns to over $800 million. 
Also, during the quarter, Fitch returned our debt ratings to investment grade. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, we are excited about our holiday plans and new capabilities and confident in our ability to execute our plan. This gives us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry. However, the 4.3% decline we saw in the NPD-reported categories got progressively worse throughout the quarter, which adds a level of caution to our outlook. 
With that, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q4 fiscal '16 is as follows: in the Domestic business, we are expecting near-flat revenue assuming, industry declines in the NPD-reported categories are in line with Q3 at approximately negative 4%, and that the timing of the Super Bowl shift results in approximately 40 basis points of sales moving out of Q4 into Q1 fiscal '17. And a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points, driven by gross profit rate pressure and higher SG&A. 
The gross profit rate pressure is primarily driven by a 25 basis point investment in Services pricing, higher distribution cost associated with our growth in the online channel and the appliance and large-screen television categories and product mix and product cycle pressures. Largely offsetting these gross profit pressures is the expected 55 basis point periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. The higher SG&A is due to our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost savings. 
In the International business, due to the ongoing impact of the Canadian brand consolidation, foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian market, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of positive 2% to 3%. 
With these expectations, our enterprise-level outlook is as follows: a negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 25 to 45 basis points. 
From a tax rate perspective, we expect a non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% versus 34.2% last year, which is expected to result in a negative $0.04 to $0.06 year-over-year in Q4 '16.

I would say there's a lot of excitement in a number of product categories. I mean, TVs, the demand for 4K TVs in our customer experience in this category is a good example of what we can accomplish.

By some retailers, second week, they were -- we released 8 deals. So that we'll just follow through on that, and October was the most notable month during the 3-month period.

But for us at Best Buy, the shift of the iPhone launch by a week was not helpful. So we will see. But as you know from our remarks this morning, mobile was not our strongest category. It was one of our down categories."

So to your question about did we go into this with a lens around what the environment feels like, we did. When you look at other retailers that have come out in the last 2 weeks, we have seen what you've seen, which is a smattering of good news and not-so-good news. And several of the areas, where the retailers tend to be catering to the higher-end consumers and have a less broad customer base, they seem to have had a slightly more impactful outlook for the fourth quarter. So we've tried to balance that between the 2, and -- but without question, we are coming into this with that as our backdrop. So is that helpful?"

Let me add a couple of comments to what Sharon was saying into your question. The trend we're seeing is that we are outperforming the industry and that based on our value proposition and great execution. You saw that in Q3. You've seen what other retailers have reported as it relates to consumer electronics. And you've seen our results, and you've seen -- you've heard our confidence getting into Q4 in terms of our ability to win and execute some of the investments we're making and some uncertainty around the market, and I think you'll see us transparent on that. Regarding the price, the promotionality, we don't see anything unusual for this quarter. In fact, if anything, it's possible that given some of the industry trends and the difficulty of competing in consumer electronics, some retailers, and we have commented on that last quarter, are less enthusiastic about this category. The potential flip side that you could see, of course, again in the spirit of transparency, if the market is bad, you can always have the risk of people wanting to liquidate their inventory, but that's not the going the ongoing assumption, and we think we are competitively priced, and we think we're going to win."

My follow-up question is, Hubert, the fourth quarter in the consumer electronics space is a little different than the first 3 quarters of the year. The first 3 quarters of the year, you have to be price competitive against other players who are profiting in consumer electronics. In the fourth quarter, in the holiday, you're competing against other product categories for wallet share. So I think everyone appreciates that you're prices on consumer electronics for the Black Friday ad are competitive, but how do you think about the cross-price elasticity of demand? So sweaters are going to be 75% off. Perhaps that will look more compelling to a consumer over the next couple of months versus buying a TV that may not have as much of a discount. And if we see that shape up, will you have to get progressively more promotional as we get closer to Christmas, especially in light of what looks like pretty heavy inventory positions, given that your inventory outpace your sales by 200 basis points. Wal-Mart and Target talked about their weakness in consumer electronics, and so arguably, the industry's getting into this holiday with a pretty heavy industry inventory position."

There is indeed a risk that I mentioned that we've talked about, which is if the industry is soft, then there's this risk of people being desperate and liquidating their inventory. We don't think that's the main thesis at this point in time. But going back to the fight against the sweaters, our teams completely understand that. I mean, I'm very proud of our team, and which is one of the reasons why we bought early and often. We start our marketing campaigns early in the season. You've seen us, in fact, before the end of October starting to talk to customers because we want to be front and center. I think that in the apparel category, I think you've seen a lot of softness, frankly. But somehow, the products in that category don't seem to be resonating that well with consumers. And in many ways, the consumer market and consumer electronics in particular, great supply creates demand, and I think the products we have, the assortment, the customer experience can be extremely exciting. If you gave me time, I could talk to sell each one of you on the call some great product, but I'm not sure Sharon would let me do that. So yes, we understand it's a broader battle. We understand the game is different, and we play slightly differently than in the rest of the year, focusing on product, product availability, being price competitive and being very confident convenient with delivery.

When you look at the outside of Best Buy industry data points about what people believe is going to be big sellers for holiday, even NPD put out a holiday outlook. And within that, one of the top categories that they expected was around video games and tech-type items. In addition to that, they thought that one of the biggest sellers this holiday, big drivers of holiday is going to be big screen TVs, where we continue to have such a substantial share, and as you guys know, probably the best assortment in all of retail. So we are so prepared to take advantage of those as Hubert pointed out and we discussed in the prepared remarks. Our inventories are probably in the best position that we've ever entered fourth quarter in recent history, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that. And reminder that it's hard to execute when you are going into these categories that carry such large SKUs. You really need capabilities in that area. I don't know whether you're selling it through the stores or selling it online, you need very strong capabilities. Not everyone is going to come out of the chute really great at this. So I think there are a list of competitive advantage, but there are numerous external data points that you can research that are saying that this going to be a very strong category this holiday."

One is why was Q3 lower than Q2 in a sense from a trend standpoint? And what has happened during the quarter? The first thing I think we all have to recognize is the nature of this industry is to have some volatility, right? Because it's so hit driven, product innovation driven and so forth. I think we also have to remember that Q2 was relatively better compared to previous trends. So we saw a difference. The most significant in a sense is the change in trajectory within the quarter that was quite significant. What exactly drove the change in trajectory was there's 2 aspects. One is it was broad based, but then there's some product-specific elements. I think it's a widespread elements that's widely known is the decline, the sharp declines in tablets. It is -- this is a category in which we have a very large market share, of course, impacts us. From an industry standpoint, there was a significant decline in that. Now since then as new product introductions that we can all be very familiar with. The weather plays a role. I think the players would have spoken about this. Our science is not sophisticated enough. People, in particular in Minnesota, like to go to their lake rather than shopping. I don't think so, okay? So that's the color I would give. Looking ahead, again to the extent that there is amazing great products and so forth, number one, it can help the industry, and certainly will help us and will going forward.

So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering with the Geek Squad Services for computing and tablet. We launched that in September 13 with Geek Squad protect and support plus. We also launched AppleCare with ramping up our Apple service provider capabilities. So we've changed the offering, moving away from pure warranties to something that is helpful to customers, and we've materially lowered the price. I think that this is something -- we've been consistent in wanting to be price competitive. Our field, our stores are very excited about this. The service offering's very good. We've seen initial pickup in the attach rates. We're very excited about that. We also know that perceptions change slowly, and like our previous investments, we do expect that it's going to take time before it pickups fully. We don't expect in this category to completely offset to have the elasticity completely offset the price investments, but we do expect to make progress. But the actions we're taking to help the customers be aware of that is the training and the proficiency of our Blue Shirts enough and the Geek Squad agents. We're also investing on the site, and I think that in the quarters ahead, we'll see continued progress. More broadly, if this is just one small first step in our Services challenges. And if you step back, what we said is that Services is actually playing -- will play a bigger role than just being a revenue and profit center. Services for us can be a part of the value proposition. So if you're going to buy a big TV, if it's going to be above 55 or 60 inches, you want somebody to deliver it and install it for you and do it really well. And of course, we have unique capabilities. We also see Services being a growth driver. So when we have somebody coming to your house, who understand your own needs and build a solution for you, we're not going to charge for the in-home visit, but this is the ability to drive business, and we see today with our Magnolia Design Centers, and there's more where it's coming from. And then as we continue to innovate our Services and evolve the positioning of their brand, you're going to see it appear more and more in our various marketing vehicles. It's true today a little bit on the site. It's true in the circular in our -- in the stores. With everything we've done, and that's going to be consistent in the last 3 years of our transformation, it's gradual and incremental. We've started that journey, and you're going to see us continue moving forward in that direction. So more to come."

And then and in addition to that, the tax rate last year at 34.5%, going up to the current rate, it's going to cost us about $0.05 to $0.06. So if you just go back and you take those up against last year, that really puts last year's EPS at about $1.35 on a comparable basis to what we have this year. Then when you go into the outlook I gave you, we talked about the fact that we've got the 25 basis point investment in Services pricing. So that's going to come off to gross profit rate. We have the higher distribution costs associated with growth in the online channel and then the appliance and large-screen TV -- large SKU costs will hit us in Q4. Of course, we're going to have the revenue as well. And then there's some product mix issues that we're expecting to hit us in Q4. And then all of those downsides will be offset by the [indiscernible] 55 basis point profit-sharing benefit. So when you're really thinking about this outlook, when you get down to the EPS range that you've got, you take the Enterprise level reductions, the OI rate, quite frankly, it is starting to look a lot like last year and maybe even on the high end a little bit better."

So it is always -- the way this periodic payment works, it is always a settling up of prior reserves, and the settlement is usually only done once a year. If you go back in history some years, we had one, some years, we didn't, but we have made such substantial changes in the program Best Buy has taken action. We put deductibles in on the phone repair, which we're the only ones in the industry that historically that didn't have one. You'll recall that. We had some plans that were multiyear plan. We have had repair reductions, where we're doing the repairs. We're sorting parts differently. There are all kinds of changes that we have made in the last couple of years, Greg, that operationally are driving this. In addition, at the same time, that we were making operational improvements around the fulfillment of claims associated with the stated warranties, from an industry point of view, and this is really a quality, vendor quality point of view, the devices have been extremely durable, and we have not seen the frequency of claims. So a combination of those are driving that. Now I can tell you that in fiscal '17 in the prepared remarks, we said we do not know what this will be, and we do not believe it'll be as high as it is in here. There will be, next year, it will come in Q4. There will be some level, our gut tell us, you never know for sure, but we believe there will be a periodic payment next year. This year, I think it is unusually high. In addition, there's a premium to be paid. Every time we sell a new warranty, there will be premiums that we pay to the insurer to take on that liability. And because of these factors, our premiums went down in the back half of this year. They will continue into next year and then on top of that, we will see another likely premium assessment downwards next year.

For me, the most important driver impact of the stores-within-a-store has manifested itself in our market share gains. The customer experience we provide is massively better and improved the experience of the customers has changed dramatically, and so we're seeing more expertise, better experience resulting in market share gains. And we see that in all of the categories, and clearly, the vendors see that as well because they've continued to look at that. Now it's an ongoing process. Looking ahead, we want to make sure that a key factor for our profitability is profit per square feet -- per square foot. And so as we look ahead with our various vendors in the various parts of our stores, we'll want to continue to optimize that. So that we win with the customers, something we want to win for our vendors, but we also want to win for us and continue to drive great outcomes. When you are in our stores, of course, every store is different, but there's some stores, where these stores-within-a-store with the addition of the Pacific Kitchen & Home, and we've Magnolia Design Centers today occupy a large part of the stores. So they're a big part of our winning with customers.
So in summary, we feel a great quarter in Q3 as a combination of online revenue growth and margin expansion in Q3 in the environment that there is a great outcome. Hopefully, you felt our excitement for Q4. Hopefully, you felt that we try to provide as much color as possible on the outlook, and we'll see you either in stores or online.

I will begin today with our third quarter results and an overview of the progress we're continuing to make against our priorities. I will then provide highlights of our holiday plans, before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
First, our Q3 results. In summary, we have delivered another quarter of Domestic comparable sales growth and operating income expansion. At the Enterprise level, on revenue of $8.8 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate by 40 basis points to 2.8% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.07 to $0.41, an increase of 21%. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales, excluding the impact of installment billing, increased 0.5%. This increase was the result of growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen televisions, partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services. 
Online comparable sales increased 18% as our new mobile site and enhanced dotcom capabilities continue to drive higher conversion rates and increased traffic. I note that during Q3, industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories were down 4.3%. 
In the International business, we continue to see the ongoing revenue impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation store closures, foreign currency and softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. However, the stronger product mix and a more effective promotional strategy have resulted in better-than-expected profitability. 
I would now like to discuss our progress on our key priority, starting with merchandising. In Appliances, we've completed our planned rollouts of Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store for the year, adding 59 stores for a total of 176. We also rolled out 225 Samsung open house appliance experiences, and with 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Appliances, we believe the investments we're making in this business are helping us win in the market. 
Furthermore, the appliance delivery and installation investments we have made this year are also driving significant improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. In home theater, with our 630 Samsung and 380 Sony stores-within-a-store and our 78 Magnolia Design Centers, we have continued to expand our industry-leading experience for customers to discover, learn about and enjoy home theater technology, especially 4K TVs. This is a significant competitive advantage for us, as 4K unit sales are expected to materially increase in the fourth quarter. 
In computing, we rolled out more than 150 additional Windows stores in the quarter -- in the third quarter and now have over 800. We also updated more than 130 of our Apple stores-within-a-store and now have 500 latest-generation Apple stores-within-a-store. 
In mobile phones, we added 225 Verizon and 225 AT&T stores-within-a-store. These shops feature highly trained specialists, who provide access to the carrier's products and services and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
Additionally, in mobile, we've added the ability for customers to buy installment billing plans online for Sprint. At this time, we are the only retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. 
Turning to digital. Our investments continue to drive results as illustrated by the 18% increase in Domestic online sales. In the third quarter, we provided free 2-day shipping to a significantly increased number of our online customers. We further benefited from the visibility and searchability of open box and clearance inventory. We expanded online-only flash sales. 
We introduced Blue Assist, a new feature in our highly rated mobile app, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call, e-mail or through scheduling of Blue Shirt in store. And we also launched a dedicated Windows 10 online experience that showcases the functionalities of Windows 10, offers customer training and highlights new Windows 10 devices. In addition, right after the end of the quarter, we launched the Best Buy app for iPad. 
Turning to marketing. Our marketing campaigns help drive a strong back-to-school performance. In the third quarter, we continued to shift our focus to social media campaigns at Millennials. We continue to increase the number of addressable e-mails, and we continue to improve the customer click-through rate to our website to enhance targeted marketing programs, enabled by our Athena customer database. 
In Services, as we discussed last quarter, we began increasing our investments to support the expanded role we're expecting Services to play in our Renew Blue transformation. The first of these investments was the September 13 launch of our new Geek Squad Services in computing in tablets. We also began setting AppleCare and piloting our new Apple-authorized service provider capabilities in more than 60 stores. 
Like AppleCare, our new Geek Squad Services are much more than extended warranties. They include providing 24/7 support to our customers and helping them take advantage of their technology products. We believe this focus will result in higher NPS scores and increase the attach rates over time. 
Initially, however, we are expecting the price investments related to these rollouts to have an approximately $40 million or 25 basis points negative gross profit rate impact in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to costs. To date this year, we've eliminated a total of $110 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over 3 years. These savings will continue to be offset, however, by the incremental SG&A investment in our future growth initiatives, which have totaled approximately $85 million so far this year, of which $20 million was in the third quarter. 
We do, however, now expect the SG&A investment to reach only $100 million this year versus the $120 million we discussed last quarter due to reducing the SG&A investment plan to partially fund the $40 million investment in Services pricing that I just discussed. 
Let me now turn to holiday. We are excited by what we are offering and delivering to our customers during this holiday shopping season. First, we have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products, especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, Appliances, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday season. 
Second, we have built some terrific new capabilities since last year, including: Number one, a range of new digital capabilities, especially Blue Assist that I described earlier; number two, an additional 1,100 stores-within-a-store, which come on top of the over 3,700 we had a year ago; number three, the increasing expertise and proficiency of our sales people; number four, our enhanced multi-channel delivery capabilities, illustrated by faster shipping, which is enabled by ship-from-store and a better in-store pickup experience; number five, the optimization of our supply chain to enable earlier store replenishments and higher order fill rates; and number six, a range of services offered to our customers, including free Geek Squad setup on top tech gifts and the ability for customers to give a gift of a Geek Squad agent's time. 
Also, from a marketing perspective, we believe we are entering the quarter with a high-performing media campaign, a significantly greater social media presence and more refined personalization capabilities through our investment in our Athena database. We, of course, recognize that we are up against a strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year and that the NPD industry decline that we saw in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, may continue throughout this year's fourth quarter. We have also made incremental investments in Services pricing and SG&A that are putting pressure on our fourth quarter earnings outlook, which Sharon will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Now one thing we are certain about is our team's ability to execute exceptionally well throughout the holiday. We're going into the holiday clear on our priorities and our plan and with a better trained, engaged and most importantly, highly determined team. I am grateful for what they've accomplished so far this year and extremely proud of their capabilities and passion to win. I know that they are ready to deliver an outstanding performance this holiday. 
I'll now turn the call to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook."
255397,315848614,906437,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 19, 2015",2015-11-19,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expec",1593,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.8% exceeded our expectations due to a Domestic $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed service plan portfolio and better-than-expected profitability in our International business. 
Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 37.1% versus our expectations of 39% to 40%, resulting in additional $0.01 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. 
Again, Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 2.4%, driven primarily by the Canadian brand consolidation, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian economy. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 21% to $0.41. This increase was primarily driven by a stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business and the $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit that I just discussed. These increases were partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact of a Canadian brand consolidation and the lapping of a prior year inventory-related legal settlement of $0.02 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 0.5%, excluding the benefit from installment billing; an estimated 30 basis point benefit associated with installment billing; and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. 
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.3%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rate. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 130 basis points to 8.8%, versus 7.5% last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, major Appliances, health and wearables and large-screen television was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and Services. 
In Services, comparable revenue declined 11.1%, almost entirely due to lower repair revenue, and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates of our traditional warranty plan. As we explained last quarter, the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranty has had the impact of reducing our repair revenue. While at face value, this appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial, because this repair revenue produces very little profit, and it is contributing to the positive performance of the externally managed portfolio. 
Additionally, in Q3, as Hubert discussed, we increased our investment in Services pricing as we expand and improve our price competitiveness in this category, particularly in computing and tablet. The impact of this price investment is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and throughout next year, of course. 
As we are discussing Services, I'd like to take a moment to provide more insight into the periodic profit-sharing benefits we are receiving from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio, as they have positively impacted our gross profit rate and earnings the last 2 quarters. And we are expecting a positive 55 basis point impact in Q4. These periodic benefits have been driven by substantial changes we have made to our insured warranty plan from both a plan design and cost-to-fulfill perspective. The portfolio has also seen an overall industry reduction in frequency of claims. All of these positive loss drivers have resulted in an overall lower-than-expected cost of our extended service plans, and we contractually share in that outperformance. As these periodic benefits are based on actual claims history of the externally managed portfolio, however, it is difficult to estimate any future potential impact, but we do not currently expect to see the same level of periodic profit-sharing benefits in fiscal '17. 
Now I will continue with our Q3 results. In our International segment, revenue declined 29.9% to $729 million due to the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry overall. 
Turning now to gross profits. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.9%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 24.1%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, which we will begin lapping in Q4, an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions, a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category, a greater portion of vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, and a 20 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. These increase were partially offset by the lapping of the 15 basis point prior year inventory-related legal settlement I just discussed. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.4%. While both Canada and Mexico had higher year-over-year gross profit rates, a higher mix of sales from our Mexico business, which carries a lower gross profit rate, drove the 20 basis point International rate decline. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 21.1% of revenue, an increase of $4 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.9% of revenues, an increase of $67 million or 60 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the flow-through of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $171 million or 23.5% of revenue, a decrease of $63 million, but a rate increase of 100 basis points. This dollar increase is primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. The 100 basis point increase is driven by the year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred a better-than-expected negative impact of $0.02 of non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter. This was the result of a more effective promotional strategy, partially offset by a weaker-than-expected Canadian economy and consumer electronics markets and from a lesser extent, lower costs from our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year. 
As such, we are narrowing our estimated EPS impact of the consolidation this year to a range of negative $0.10 to $0.12, versus our previous estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.17. This expectation is broken down as follows: The negative $0.04 that we've incurred in the first 9 months of this year and a negative $0.06 to $0.08 in Q4. 
Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the third quarter, we returned over $140 million in cash to our shareholders, $64 million through share repurchases and $79 million in regular dividends, bringing our year-to-date total cash returns to over $800 million. 
Also during the quarter, Fitch returned our debt rating to investment grade. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, we are excited about our holiday plans and new capabilities and confident in our ability to execute our plan. This gives us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry. However, the 4.3% decline we saw in the NPD-reported categories got progressively worse throughout the quarter, which adds a level of caution to our outlook. 
With that, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q4 fiscal '16 is as follows: In the Domestic business, we are expecting near-flat revenue, assuming industry declines in the NPD-recorded categories are in line with Q3 at approximately negative 4%, and that the timing of the Super Bowl shift results in approximately 40 basis points of sales moving out of Q4 into Q1 fiscal '17. And a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points, driven by gross profit rate pressure and higher SG&A. 
The gross profit rate pressure is primarily driven by a 25 basis point investment in Services pricing, higher distribution cost associated with our growth in the online channel and the appliance and large-screen television categories and product mix and product cycle pressures. Largely offsetting these gross profit pressures is the expected 55 basis point periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. The higher SG&A is due to our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost savings. 
In the International business, due to the ongoing impact of the Canadian brand consolidation, foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian market, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of positive 2% to 3%. 
With these expectations, our enterprise-level outlook is as follows: A negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 25 to 45 basis points. 
From a tax rate perspective, we expect a non-GAAP-affected income tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% versus 34.2% last year, which is expected to result in a negative $0.04 to $0.06 year-over-year in Q4 '16.

We want to be transparent with our shareholders. Our forecast reflects everything we know at this point, and you see us determined to -- irrespective of what's going to happen in the market, there's so much we control, and what we've put in place, the capabilities we have, allow us to win. And so we're in this to win this, and so I'm afraid that it's hard to directly answer your question about exactly what the demand is going to be, but we've tried our best today to give you as much transparency as possible around the categories. I would say there's a lot of excitement in a number of product categories. I mean, TVs, the demand for 4K TVs in our customer experience in this category is a good example of what we can accomplish. Appliances is less of a giftable item, maybe, but our momentum continues to be strong in the market, and that category continues to be very strong. There's a lot of excitement in health and wearables, connected devices. I'm planning to buy a drone myself, so if you want to join me, but there's these recent trends we saw at the end of the quarter that we wanted to highlight for our investors in this period of transparency."

I'll just add to that, that we believe there was another dynamic in October, which is pent-up demand with people waiting to anticipate Black Friday deals, because Black Friday, as we all know, has turned into Black November, and we believe that, that has a particularly stronger impact on the consumer electronics category than other categories. So even going from the last weeks of October to the first week of November, we just got that data off the press. We actually saw a significant improvement from the last weeks of October and the first week of November.

We have not only an amazing assortment, amazing prices, and we have the quantities for consumers.

We like that because that's what really led us to our premise, especially in October, around the pent-up demand. Because it really isn't product specific. It was sort of categorically specific, so that was, in our minds, again another data point, which just says the customer was looking forward to Black Friday. Just remember, the first Black Friday deals were released in the first week of November. By some retailers, second week, they were -- we released 8 deals. So that we'll just follow through on that. And October was the most notable month during the 3-month period. As you pointed out, there are categories that are outside of that. Appliances is another category that is actually outside of NPD. And with that, we saw exceptional growth again this quarter, and we are so encouraged by the work that we're doing on the Appliance side. In the mobile category, we did see, I believe -- we believe the industry grew knowing what the industry did for mobile is very difficult, but we do believe if you look just at units that there was growth. But for us, at Best Buy, the shift of the iPhone launch by a week was not helpful. So we will see. But as you know from our remarks this morning, mobile was not our strongest category.

So to your question about did we go into this with a lens around what the environment feels like, we did. When you look at other retailers that have come out in the last 2 weeks, we have seen what you've seen, which is a smattering of good news and not-so-good news. And several of the areas, where the retailers tend to be catering to the higher-end consumers and have a less broad customer base, they seem to have had a slightly more impactful outlook for the fourth quarter. So we've tried to balance that between the 2, and -- but without question, we are coming into this with that as our backdrop. So is that helpful?"

Let me add a couple of comments to what Sharon was saying into your question.

You've seen what other retailers have reported as it relates to consumer electronics. And you've seen our results, and you've seen -- you've heard our confidence getting into Q4 in terms of our ability to win and execute some of the investments we're making and some uncertainty around the market, and I think you'll see us transparent on that. Regarding the price -- the promotionality, we don't see anything unusual for this quarter. In fact, if anything, it's possible that given some of the industry trends and the difficulty of competing in consumer electronics, some retailers, and we have commented on that last quarter, are less enthusiastic about this category. The potential flip side that you could see, of course, again in the spirit of transparency, if the market is bad, you can always have the risk of people wanting to liquidate their inventory, but that's not the ingoing assumption.

My follow-up question is, Hubert, the fourth quarter in the consumer electronics space is a little different than the first 3 quarters of the year. The first 3 quarters of the year, you have to be price competitive against other players who are trafficking in consumer electronics. In the fourth quarter, in the holiday, you're competing against other product categories for wallet share. So I think everyone appreciates that your prices on consumer electronics for the Black Friday ad are competitive, but how do you think about the cross-price elasticity of demand? So sweaters are going to be 75% off. Perhaps, that will look more compelling to a consumer over the next couple of months versus buying a TV that may not have as much of a discount. And if we see that shape up, will you have to get progressively more promotional as we get closer to Christmas, especially in light of what looks like pretty heavy inventory positions, given that your inventory outpaced your sales by a few basis points. Wal-Mart and Target talked about their weakness in consumer electronics, and so arguably, the industry's getting into this holiday with a pretty heavy industry inventory position."

We don't think that's the main thesis at this point in time. But going back to the fight against the sweaters, our teams completely understand that. I mean, I'm very proud of our team, and which is one of the reasons why we bought early, and often, we start our marketing campaigns early in the season. You've seen us, in fact, before the end of October starting to talk to customers because we want to be front and center. I think that in the apparel category, I think you've seen a lot of softness, frankly. But somehow, the products in that category don't seem to be resonating that well with consumers. And in many ways, the consumer market and consumer electronics in particular, great supply creates demand, and I think the products we have, the assortment, the customer experience can be extremely exciting. If you gave me time, I could talk to sell each one of you on the call some great products, but I'm not sure Sharon would let me do that. So we -- yes, we understand it's a broader battle.

When you look at the outside of Best Buy industry data points about what people believe is going to be big sellers for holiday, even NPD put out a holiday outlook.

In addition to that, they thought that one of the biggest sellers this holiday, big drivers of holiday is going to be big screen TVs, where we continue to have such substantial share, and as you guys know, probably the best assortment in all of retail. So we are so prepared to take advantage of those, as Hubert pointed out, and we discussed in the prepared remarks. Our inventories are probably in the best position that we've ever entered fourth quarter in recent history, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that. And reminder that it's hard to execute when you are going into these categories that carry such large SKU. You really need capabilities in that area. I don't -- whether you're selling it through the stores or selling it online, you need very strong capabilities. Not everyone is going to come out of the chute really great at this. So I think there are a list of competitive advantage, but there are numerous external data points that you can research that are saying that this is going to be a very strong category this holiday."

One is why was Q3 lower than Q2 in a sense from a trend standpoint? And what has happened during the quarter? The first thing I think we all have to recognize is the nature of this industry is to have some volatility, right? Because it's so hit driven, product innovation driven and so forth. I think we also have to remember that Q2 was relatively better compared to previous trends. So we saw a difference. The most significant in a sense is the change in trajectory within the quarter that was quite significant. What exactly drove the change in trajectory was there's 2 aspects. One is it was broad based, but then there's some product-specific elements. I think it's a widespread elements that's widely known is the decline -- the sharp declines of tablets. It is -- this is a category in which we have a very large market share, of course, to impacts us. From an industry standpoint, there was a significant decline in that. Now since then, as the new product introductions that we can all be very familiar with that the weather plays a role. I think the [indiscernible] players would have spoken about this. Our science is not sophisticated enough. The people, in particular in Minnesota, like to go to their lake rather than shopping. It's not that they don't think so, okay? So that's the color I would give. Looking ahead, again to the extent that there is amazing great products and so forth, number one, it can help the industry, and certainly will help us, and we will take advantage of it. I would like to ask you, David, to repeat your question around service, because I'm not sure I fully understand it.

So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering with the Geek Squad services for computing and tablet.",490,"Yes, thank you for that question. So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering with the Geek Squad services for computing and tablet. We launched that on September 13 with Geek Squad protect and support plus. And we also launched AppleCare with ramping up our Apple service provider capabilities. So we've changed the offering, moving away from pure warranties to something that is helpful to customers, and we've materially lowered the price. I think that this is something -- we've been consistent in wanting to be price competitive. Our field, our stores are very excited about this. The service offering is very good. We've seen initial pickup in the attach rates. We're very excited about that. We also know that perceptions change slowly, and like our previous investments, we do expect that it's going to take time before it pickups fully. We don't expect in this category to completely offset to have the elasticity completely offset the price investments, but we do expect to make progress. But the actions we're taking to help the customers be aware of that is the training and the proficiency of our Blue Shirts and -- as well as the Geek Squad agents. We're also investing on the site. And I think that in the quarters ahead, we'll see continued progress. More broadly -- because this is just one small first step in our Services strategy. And if you step back, what we said is that Services is actually playing -- will play a bigger role than just being a revenue and profit center. Services for us can be a part of the value proposition. So if you're going to buy a big TV, if it's going to be above 55 or 60 inches, you want somebody to deliver it and install it for you and do it really well. And of course, we have unique capabilities. We also see Services being a growth driver. So when we have somebody coming to your house, who understand your needs and build a solution for you, we're not going to charge for the in-home visit, but this is -- this has the ability to drive business, and we see it today with our Magnolia Design Centers and there's more where it's coming from. And then as we continue to innovate our Services and evolve the positioning of the brand, you're going to see it appear more and more in our various marketing vehicles. It's true today a little bit on the site. It's truing the circular in our -- in the stores. With everything we've done, and that's going to be consistent in the last 3 years of our transformation, it's gradual and incremental. We've started that journey, and you're going to see us continue moving forward in that direction. So more to come."

So on a -- if you just go back and you take those up against last year, that really puts last year's EPS at about $1.35 on a comparable basis to what we have this year. Then when you go into the outlook I gave you, we talked about the fact that we've got the 25 basis point investment in Services pricing. So that's going to come off to gross profit rate. We have the higher distribution costs associated with growth in the online channel and then the appliance and large-screen TV -- large SKU costs will hit us in Q4. Of course, we're going to have the revenue as well. And then there's some product mix issues that are -- we're expecting to hit us in Q4. And then all of those downsides will be offset by the 50 basis point -- exactly, 55 basis point profit-sharing benefit. So when you're really thinking about this outlook, when you get down to the EPS range that you've got when you take the Enterprise level reductions, the OI rate, quite frankly, it is not look -- starting to look a lot like last year and, maybe, even on the high end a little bit better."

If you go back in history, some years, we had one, some years, we didn't, but we have made such substantial changes in the program Best Buy has taken action. We put deductibles in on the phone repair, which we were the only ones in the industry historically that didn't have one. You'll recall that. We had some plans that were multiyear plans. We have had repair reductions, where we're doing the repairs. We're sorting parts differently. There are all kinds of changes that we have made in the last couple of years, Greg, that operationally are driving this. In addition, at the same time, that we were making operational improvements around the fulfillment of claims associated with the extended warranties, from an industry point of view, and this is really a quality -- vendor quality point of view. The devices have been extremely durable, and we have not seen the frequency of claims. So a combination of those are driving that. Now I can tell you that in fiscal '17 in the prepared remarks, we said we do not know what this will be, and we do not believe that it'll be as high as it is in here. There will be next year; it will come in Q4. There will be some level, our gut tell us. You never know for sure, but we believe there will be a periodic payment next year. This year, I think it is -- we think it is unusually high. In addition, there's a premium to be paid. Every time we sell a new warranty, there will be premiums that we pay to the insurer to take on that liability. And because of these factors, our premiums went down in the back half of this year. They will continue into next year and then on top of that, we will see another likely premium assessment downwards next year.

For me, the most important driver or impact of the stores-within-a-store has manifested itself in our market share gains. The customer experience we provide is massively better and improved. The experience of the customers has changed dramatically. And so we're seeing more expertise, better experience resulting in market share gains. And we see that in all of the categories, and clearly, the vendors see that as well because they've continued to look at that. Now it's an ongoing process. Looking ahead, we want to make sure that a key factor for our profitability is profit per square feet -- per square foot. And so as we look ahead with our various vendors in the various parts of our stores, we'll want to continue to optimize that, so that we win with the customers, something we want to win for our vendors, but we also want to win for us and drive -- continue to drive great outcomes.

I will begin today with our third quarter results and an overview of the progress we're continuing to make against our priorities. I will then provide highlights of our holiday plans, before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
First, our Q3 results. In summary, we have delivered another quarter of Domestic comparable sales growth and operating income expansion. At the Enterprise level, on revenue of $8.8 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate by 40 basis points to 2.8% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.07 to $0.41, an increase of 21%. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales, excluding the impact of installment billing, increased 0.5%. This increase was the result of growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen televisions, partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services. 
Online comparable sales increased 18% as our new mobile site and enhanced dotcom capabilities continue to drive higher conversion rates and increase traffic. I note that during Q3, industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories were down 4.3%. 
In the International business, we continue to see the ongoing revenue impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation store closures, foreign currency and softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. However, the stronger product mix and a more effective promotional strategy have resulted in better-than-expected profitability. 
I would now like to discuss our progress on our key priorities, starting with merchandising. In Appliances, we've completed our planned rollout of Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store for the year, adding 59 stores for a total of 176. We also rolled out 225 Samsung Open House appliance experiences, and with 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Appliances, we believe the investments we're making in this business are helping us win in the market. 
Furthermore, the appliance delivery and installation investments we have made this year are also driving significant improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. In home theater, with our 630 Samsung and 380 Sony stores-within-a-store and our 78 Magnolia Design Centers, we have continued to expand our industry-leading experience for customers to discover, learn about and enjoy home theater technology, especially 4K TVs. This is a significant competitive advantage for us, as 4K unit sales are expected to materially increase in the fourth quarter. 
In computing, we rolled out more than 150 additional Windows stores in the quarter -- in the third quarter and now have over 800. We also updated more than 130 of our Apple stores-within-a-store and now have 500 latest-generation Apple stores-within-a-store. 
In mobile phones, we added 225 Verizon and 225 AT&T stores-within-a-store. These shops feature highly trained specialists, who provide access to the carrier's products and services and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
Additionally, in mobile, we've added the ability for customers to buy installment billing plans online for Sprint. At this time, we are the only retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. 
Turning to digital. Our investments continue to drive results as illustrated by the 18% increase in Domestic online sales. In the third quarter, we provided free 2-day shipping to a significantly increased number of our online customers. We further benefited from the visibility and searchability of open box and clearance inventory. We expanded online-only flash sales. 
We introduced Blue Assist, a new feature in our highly rated mobile app, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call, email or through scheduling of Blue Shirt in store. And we also launched a dedicated Windows 10 online experience that showcases the functionalities of Windows 10, offers customer training and highlights new Windows 10 devices. In addition, right after the end of the quarter, we launched the Best Buy app for iPad. 
Turning to marketing. Our marketing campaign helped drive a strong back-to-school performance. In the third quarter, we continued to shift our focus to social media campaigns at Millennials. We continued to increase the number of addressable emails, and we continued to improve the customer click-through rate to our website to enhance targeted marketing programs, enabled by our Athena customer database. 
In Services, as we discussed last quarter, we began increasing our investments to support the expanded role we're expecting Services to play in our Renew Blue transformation. The first of these investments was the September 13 launch of our new Geek Squad Services in computing in tablets. We also began selling AppleCare and piloting our new Apple-authorized service provider capabilities in more than 60 stores. 
Like AppleCare, our new Geek Squad Services are much more than extended warranties. They include providing 24/7 support to our customers and helping them take advantage of their technology products. We believe this focus will result in higher NPS scores and increase attach rates over time. 
Initially, however, we are expecting the price investments related to these rollouts to have an approximately $40 million or 25 basis points negative gross profit rate impact in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to costs. To-date this year, we've eliminated a total of $110 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over 3 years. These savings will continue to be offset, however, by the incremental SG&A investment in our future growth initiatives, which have totaled approximately $85 million so far this year, of which $20 million was in the third quarter. 
We do, however, now expect the SG&A investment to reach only $100 million this year versus the $120 million we discussed last quarter due to reducing the SG&A investment plan to partially fund the $40 million investment in Services pricing that I just discussed. 
Let me now turn to holiday. We are excited by what we are offering and delivering to our customers during this holiday shopping season. First, we have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products, especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, Appliances, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday season. 
Second, we have built some terrific new capabilities since last year, including: number one, a range of new digital capabilities, especially Blue Assist that I described earlier; number two, an additional 1,100 stores-within-a-store, which come on top of the over 3,700 we had a year ago; number three, the increasing expertise and proficiency of our sales people; number four, our enhanced multichannel delivery capabilities, illustrated by faster shipping, which is enabled by ship-from-store and a better in-store pickup experience; number five, the optimization of our supply chain to enable earlier store replenishments and higher order fill rates; and number six, a range of services offered to our customers, including free Geek Squad setup on top tech gifts and the ability for customers to give a gift of a Geek Squad agent's time. 
Also, from a marketing perspective, we believe we are entering the quarter with a high-performing media campaign, a significantly greater social media presence and more refined personalization capabilities through our investment in our Athena database. We, of course, recognize that we are up against a strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year and that the NPD industry decline that we saw in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, may continue throughout this year's fourth quarter. We have also made incremental investments in Services pricing and SG&A that are putting pressure on our fourth quarter earnings outlook, which Sharon will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Now one thing we are certain about is our team's ability to execute exceptionally well throughout the holiday. We're going into the holiday clear on our priorities and our plan and with a better trained, engaged and most importantly, highly determined team. I am grateful for what they've accomplished so far this year and extremely proud of their capabilities and passion to win. I know that they are ready to deliver an outstanding performance this holiday. 
I'll now turn the call to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook."

Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.8% exceeded our expectations due to a Domestic $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed service plan portfolio and better-than-expected profitability in our International business. 
Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 37.1% versus our expectations of 39% to 40%, resulting in additional $0.01 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. 
Again, Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 2.4%, driven primarily by the Canadian brand consolidation, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian economy. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 21% to $0.41. This increase was primarily driven by a stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business and the $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit that I just discussed. These increases were partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and the lapping of a prior year inventory-related legal settlement of $0.02 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 0.5%, excluding the benefit from installment billing; an estimated 30 basis point benefit associated with installment billing; and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. 
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.3%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 130 basis points to 8.8%, versus 7.5% last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen television was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and Services. 
In Services, comparable revenue declined 11.1%, almost entirely due to lower repair revenue, and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates of our traditional warranty plan. As we explained last quarter, the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranty has had the impact of reducing our repair revenue. While at face value, this appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial, because this repair revenue produces very little profit, and it is contributing to the positive performance of the externally managed portfolio. 
Additionally, in Q3, as Hubert discussed, we increased our investment in Services pricing as we expand and improve our price competitiveness in this category, particularly in computing and tablets. The impact of this price investment is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and throughout next year, of course. 
As we are discussing Services, I'd like to take a moment to provide more insight into the periodic profit-sharing benefits we are receiving from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio, as they have positively impacted our gross profit rate and earnings the last 2 quarters. And we are expecting a positive 55 basis point impact in Q4. These periodic benefits have been driven by substantial changes we have made to our insured warranty plan from both a plan design and cost-to-fulfill perspective. The portfolio has also seen an overall industry reduction in frequency of claims. All of these positive loss drivers have resulted in an overall lower-than-expected cost of our extended service plans, and we contractually share in that outperformance. As these periodic benefits are based on actual claims history of the externally managed portfolio, however, it is difficult to estimate any future potential impact, but we do not currently expect to see the same level of periodic profit-sharing benefits in fiscal '17. 
Now I will continue with our Q3 results. In our International segment, revenue declined 29.9% to $729 million due to the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry overall. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.9%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 24.1%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, which we will begin lapping in Q4; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category; a greater portion of vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A; and a 20 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the 15 basis point prior year inventory-related legal settlement I just discussed. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.4%. While both Canada and Mexico had higher year-over-year gross profit rates, a higher mix of sales from our Mexico business, which carries a lower gross profit rate, drove the 20 basis point International rate decline. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 21.1% of revenue, an increase of $4 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.9% of revenues, an increase of $67 million or 60 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the flow-through of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $171 million or 23.5% of revenue, a decrease of $63 million, but a rate increase of 100 basis points. This dollar increase is primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. The 100 basis point increase is driven by the year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred a better-than-expected negative impact of $0.02 of non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter. This was the result of a more effective promotional strategy, partially offset by a weaker-than-expected Canadian economy and consumer electronics market and from a lesser extent, lower costs from our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year. 
As such, we are narrowing our estimated EPS impact of the consolidation this year to a range of negative $0.10 to $0.12, versus our previous estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.17. This expectation is broken down as follows: The negative $0.04 that we've incurred in the first 9 months of this year and a negative $0.06 to $0.08 in Q4. 
Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the third quarter, we returned over $140 million in cash to our shareholders, $64 million through share repurchases and $79 million in regular dividends, bringing our year-to-date total cash returned to over $800 million. 
Also during the quarter, Fitch returned our debt rating to investment grade. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, we are excited about our holiday plans and new capabilities and confident in our ability to execute our plans. This gives us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry. However, the 4.3% decline we saw in the NPD-reported categories got progressively worse throughout the quarter, which adds a level of caution to our outlook. 
With that, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q4 fiscal '16 is as follows: in the Domestic business, we are expecting near-flat revenue, assuming industry declines in the NPD-recorded categories are in line with Q3 at approximately negative 4%, and that the timing of the Super Bowl shift results in approximately 40 basis points of sales moving out of Q4 into Q1 fiscal '17; and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points, driven by gross profit rate pressure and higher SG&A. 
The gross profit rate pressure is primarily driven by a 25 basis point investment in Services pricing, higher distribution cost associated with our growth in the online channel and the appliance and large-screen television categories and product mix and product cycle pressures. Largely offsetting these gross profit pressures is the expected 55 basis point periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. The higher SG&A is due to our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost savings. 
In the International business, due to the ongoing impact of the Canadian brand consolidation, foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian market, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of positive 2% to 3%. 
With these expectations, our enterprise-level outlook is as follows: a negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 25 to 45 basis points. 
From a tax rate perspective, we expect a non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% versus 34.2% last year, which is expected to result in a negative $0.04 to $0.06 year-over-year in Q4 '16.

What we're very clear about is what we control, and as we said, we're extremely well positioned to deliver. Clearly, we've been gaining market share, and so that gives us enormous confidence. Exactly what's going to be the demand during the quarter? You've seen a lot of volatility across retail categories in the last few months. So we've noted these facts. We want to be transparent with our shareholders. Our forecast reflects everything we know at this point, and you see us determined to -- irrespective of what's going to happen in the market, there's so much we control, and what we've put in place, the capabilities we have, allow us to win. And so we're in this to win this. And so I'm afraid that it's hard to directly answer your question about exactly what the demand is going to be, but we've tried our best today to give you as much transparency as possible around the categories. I would say there's a lot of excitement in a number of product categories. I mean, TVs, the demand for 4K TVs in our customer experience in this category is a great example of what we can accomplish. Appliances is less of a giftable item, maybe, but our momentum continues to be strong in the market, and that category continues to be very strong. There's a lot of excitement in health and wearables, connected devices. I'm planning to buy a drone myself, so if you want to join me, but there's these recent trends we saw at the end of the quarter that we wanted to highlight for our investors in this period of transparency."

So that was, in our minds, again another data point, which just says the customer was looking forward to Black Friday. Because remember, the first Black Friday deals were released in the first week of November. By some retailers, second week, they were -- we released 8 deals. So that -- we'll just follow through on that. And October was the most notable month during the 3-month period. As you pointed out, there are categories that are outside of that. Appliances is another category that is actually outside of NPD. And with that, we saw exceptional growth again this quarter, and we are so encouraged by the work that we're doing on the Appliance side. In the mobile category, we did see, I believe -- we believe the industry grew. Knowing what the industry did for mobile is very difficult, but we do believe if you look just at units that there was growth. But for us, at Best Buy, the shift of the iPhone launch by a week was not helpful. So we will see. But as you know from our remarks this morning, mobile was not our strongest category.

When you look at other retailers that have come out in the last 2 weeks, we have seen what you've seen, which is a smattering of good news and not-so-good news. And several of the areas where the retailers tend to be catering to the higher-end consumers and have a less broad customer base, they seem to have had a slightly more impactful outlook for the fourth quarter.

In fact, if anything, it's possible that given some of the industry trends and the difficulty of competing in consumer electronics, some retailers, and we have commented on that last quarter, are less enthusiastic about this category.

My follow-up question is, Hubert, the fourth quarter in the consumer electronics space is a little different than the first 3 quarters of the year. The first 3 quarters of the year, you have to be price competitive against other players who are trafficking in consumer electronics. In the fourth quarter, in the holiday, you're competing against other product categories for wallet share. So I think everyone appreciates that your prices on consumer electronics for the Black Friday ad are competitive, but how do you think about the cross-price elasticity of demand? So if sweaters are going to be 75% off, perhaps that will look more compelling to a consumer over the next couple of months versus buying a TV that may not have as much of a discount. And if we see that shape up, will you have to get progressively more promotional as we get closer to Christmas? Especially in light of what looks like pretty heavy inventory positions, given that your inventory outpaced your sales by a few basis points. Wal-Mart and Target talked about their weakness in consumer electronics, and so arguably, the industry's heading into this holiday with a pretty heavy industry -- inventory position."

There is, indeed, a risk that I mentioned that we've talked about, which is the -- if the industry is soft, then there's this risk of people being desperate and liquidating their inventory. We don't think that's the main thesis at this point in time. But going back to the fight against the sweaters, our teams completely understand that. I mean, I'm very proud of our team, and which is one of the reasons why we bought early, and often, we start our marketing campaigns early in the season. You've seen us, in fact, before the end of October starting to talk to customers because we want to be front and center. I think that in the apparel category, I think you've seen a lot of softness, frankly. But somehow, the products in that category don't seem to be resonating that well with consumers. And in many ways, the consumer market and consumer electronics in particular, great supply creates demand, and I think the products we have, the assortment, the customer experience can be extremely exciting. If you gave me time, I could try to sell each one of you on the call some great products, but I'm not sure Sharon would let me do that. So we -- yes, we understand it's a broader battle. We understand the game is different, and we play it slightly differently than in the rest of the year, focusing on product, product availability, being price competitive and being very convenient with delivery. Our free 2-day delivery capabilities are very significant. So you can feel how excited and good we feel about this fight. Bring them over. We're ready."

When you look at the outside of Best Buy industry data points about what people believe is going to be big sellers for holiday, even NPD put out a holiday outlook. And within that, one of the top categories that they expected was around video games and tech-type items. In addition to that, they thought that one of the biggest sellers this holiday, big drivers of holiday, is going to be big screen TVs, where we continue to have such substantial share, and as you guys know, probably the best assortment in all of retail. So we are so prepared to take advantage of those, as Hubert pointed out, and we discussed in the prepared remarks. Our inventories are probably in the best position that we've ever entered a fourth quarter in recent history, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that. And reminder that it's hard to execute when you are going into these categories that carry such large cubes. You really need capabilities in that area. I don't -- whether you're selling it through the stores or selling it online, you need very strong capabilities. Not everyone is going to come out of the chute really great at this. So I think there are a list of competitive advantage, but there are numerous external data points that you can research that are saying that this is going to be a very strong category this holiday."

One is why was Q3 lower than Q2 in a sense from a trend standpoint? And what has happened during the quarter? The first thing I think we all have to recognize is the nature of this industry is to have some volatility, right? Because it's so hit driven, product innovation driven and so forth. I think we also have to remember that Q2 was relatively better compared to previous trends. So we saw a difference. The most significant in a sense is the change in trajectory within the quarter that was quite significant. What exactly drove the change in trajectory was -- there's 2 aspects. One is it was broad based, but then there's some product-specific elements. I think it's a widespread elements that's widely known is the decline -- the sharp declines of tablets. It is -- this is a category in which we have a very large market share, of course, so it impacts us. But from an industry standpoint, there was a significant decline in that. Now since then, there's been new product introductions that we can all be very familiar with. Does the weather plays a role. I think the apparel players would have spoken about this. Our science is not sophisticated enough. The people, in particular in Minnesota, like to go to their lake rather than shopping. It's not -- don't think so, okay? So that's the color I would give. Looking ahead, again to the extent that there is amazing great products and so forth, number one, it can help the industry, and certainly will help us, and we will take advantage of it.

So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that.

So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering with the Geek Squad services for computing and tablet. We launched that on September 13 with Geek Squad Protect and Support Plus. And we also launched AppleCare with ramping up our Apple service provider capabilities. So we've changed the offering, moving away from pure warranties to something that is helpful to customers, and we've materially lowered the price. I think that this is something -- we've been consistent in wanting to be price competitive. Our field, our stores are very excited about this. The service offering is very good. We've seen initial pickup in the attach rates. We're very excited about that. We also know that perceptions change slowly, and like our previous investments, we do expect that it's going to take time before it pickups fully. We don't expect in this category to completely offset -- to have the elasticity completely offset the price investments, but we do expect to make progress. But the actions we're taking to help the customers be aware of that is the training and the proficiency of our Blue Shirts and of course the Geek Squad agents. We're also investing on the site. And I think that in the quarters ahead, we'll see continued progress. More broadly -- because this is just one small first step in our Services strategy. And if you step back, what we've said is that Services is actually playing -- will play a bigger role than just being a revenue and profit center. Services for us can be a part of the value proposition. So if you're going to buy a big TV, if it's going to be above 55 or 60 inches, you want somebody to deliver it and install it for you and do it really well. And of course, we have unique capabilities. We also see Services being a growth driver. So when we have somebody coming to your house, who understand your needs and build a solution for you, we're not going to charge for the in-home visit, but this is -- this has the ability to drive business, and we see it today with our Magnolia Design Centers and there's more where it's coming from. And then as we continue to innovate our Services and evolve the positioning of the brand, you're going to see it appear more and more in our various marketing vehicles. It's true today a little bit on the site. It's truing the circular in our -- in the stores. With everything we've done, and that's going to be consistent in the last 3 years of our transformation, it's gradual and incremental. We've started that journey, and you're going to see us continue moving forward in that direction. So more to come."

And then in addition to that, the tax rate last year at 34.5%, going up to the current rate, is going to cost us about $0.05 to $0.06. So on a -- if you just go back and you take those up against last year, that really puts last year's EPS at about $1.35 on a comparable basis to what we have this year. Then when you go into the outlook I gave you, we talked about the fact that we've got the 25 basis point investment in Services pricing. So that's going to come off the gross profit, right? We have the higher distribution costs associated with growth in the online channel and then the appliance and large-screen TV -- large cube costs will hit us in Q4. Of course, we're going to have the revenue as well. And then there's some product mix issues that are -- we're expecting to hit us in Q4. And then all of those downsides will be offset by the 50 basis point -- it's actually 55 basis point profit-sharing benefit. So when you're really thinking about this outlook, when you get down to the EPS range that you get when you take the Enterprise level reduction on the OI rate, quite frankly, it is not look -- it's starting to look a lot like last year and, maybe, even on the high end a little bit better."

If you go back in history, some years, we had one, some years, we didn't, but we have made such substantial changes in the program. Best Buy has taken action. We put deductibles in on the phone repair, which we were the only ones in the industry, historically, that didn't have one. You'll recall that. We had some plans that were multiyear plans. We have had repair reductions, where we're doing the repairs. We're sourcing parts differently. There are all kinds of changes that we have made in the last couple of years, Greg, that operationally are driving this. In addition, at the same time, that we were making operational improvements around the fulfillment of claims associated with the extended warranties, from an industry point of view, and this is really a quality -- vendor quality point of view. The devices have been extremely durable, and we have not seen the frequency of claims. So the combination of those are driving that. Now I can tell you that in fiscal '17 in the prepared remarks, we said we do not know what this will be, and we do not believe it'll be as high as it is this year. There will be next year; it will come in Q4. There will be some level, our gut tells us. You never know for sure, but we believe there will be a periodic payment next year. This year, I think it is -- we think it is unusually high. In addition, there's the premium to be paid. Every time we sell a new warranty, there will be premiums that we pay to the insurer to take on that liability. And because of these factors, our premiums went down in the back half of this year. They will continue into next year and then on top of that, we will see another likely premium assessment downward next year. So that -- we can talk more about it in the one-on-one call, if you'd like further color, so that I can get to your second question, but..."

And we see that in all of the categories, and clearly, the vendors see that as well because they've continued to look at that. Now it's an ongoing process. Looking ahead, we want to make sure that a key factor for our profitability is profit per square feet -- per square foot. And so as we look ahead with our various vendors in the various parts of our stores, we'll want to continue to optimize that, so that we win with the customers, something we want to win for our vendors, but we also want to win for us and drive -- continue to drive great outcomes.

I will begin today with our third quarter results and an overview of the progress we're continuing to make against our priorities. I will then provide highlights of our holiday plans, before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. 
First, our Q3 results. In summary, we have delivered another quarter of Domestic comparable sales growth and operating income expansion. At the Enterprise level, on revenue of $8.8 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate by 40 basis points to 2.8% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.07 to $0.41, an increase of 21%. 
In the Domestic business, our comparable sales, excluding the impact of installment billing, increased 0.5%. This increase was the result of growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen televisions, partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services. 
Online comparable sales increased 18% as our new mobile site and enhanced dotcom capabilities continue to drive higher conversion rates and increase traffic. I note that during Q3, industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories were down 4.3%. 
In the International business, we continue to see the ongoing revenue impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation store closures, foreign currency and softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. However, the stronger product mix and a more effective promotional strategy have resulted in better-than-expected profitability. 
I would now like to discuss our progress on our key priorities, starting with merchandising. In Appliances, we've completed our planned rollout of Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store for the year, adding 59 stores for a total of 176. We also rolled out 225 Samsung Open House appliance experiences, and with 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Appliances, we believe the investments we're making in this business are helping us win in the market. 
Furthermore, the appliance delivery and installation investments we have made this year are also driving significant improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. In home theater, with our 630 Samsung and 380 Sony stores-within-a-store and our 78 Magnolia Design Centers, we have continued to expand our industry-leading experience for customers to discover, learn about and enjoy home theater technology, especially 4K TVs. This is a significant competitive advantage for us, as 4K unit sales are expected to materially increase in the fourth quarter. 
In computing, we rolled out more than 150 additional Windows stores in the quarter -- in the third quarter and now have over 800. We also updated more than 130 of our Apple stores-within-a-store and now have 500 latest-generation Apple stores-within-a-store. 
In mobile phones, we added 225 Verizon and 225 AT&T stores-within-a-store. These shops feature highly trained specialists, who provide access to the carrier's products and services and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. 
Additionally, in mobile, we've added the ability for customers to buy installment billing plans online for Sprint. At this time, we are the only retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. 
Turning to digital. Our investments continue to drive results as illustrated by the 18% increase in Domestic online sales. In the third quarter, we provided free 2-day shipping to a significantly increased number of our online customers. We further benefited from the visibility and searchability of open box and clearance inventory. We expanded online-only flash sales. 
We introduced Blue Assist, a new feature in our highly rated mobile app, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call, email or through scheduling of Blue Shirt in store. And we also launched a dedicated Windows 10 online experience that showcases the functionalities of Windows 10, offers customer training and highlights new Windows 10 devices. In addition, right after the end of the quarter, we launched the Best Buy app for iPad. 
Turning to marketing. Our marketing campaign helped drive a strong back-to-school performance. In the third quarter, we continued to shift our focus to social media campaigns at Millennials. We continued to increase the number of addressable emails, and we continued to improve the customer click-through rate to our website to enhance targeted marketing programs, enabled by our Athena customer database. 
In Services, as we discussed last quarter, we began increasing our investments to support the expanded role we're expecting Services to play in our Renew Blue transformation. The first of these investments was the September 13 launch of our new Geek Squad Services in computing in tablets. We also began selling AppleCare and piloting our new Apple-authorized service provider capabilities in more than 60 stores. 
Like AppleCare, our new Geek Squad Services are much more than extended warranties. They include providing 24/7 support to our customers and helping them take advantage of their technology products. We believe this focus will result in higher NPS scores and increase attach rates over time. 
Initially, however, we are expecting the price investments related to these rollouts to have an approximately $40 million or 25 basis points negative gross profit rate impact in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to costs. To-date this year, we've eliminated a total of $110 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over 3 years. These savings will continue to be offset, however, by the incremental SG&A investment in our future growth initiatives, which have totaled approximately $85 million so far this year, of which $20 million was in the third quarter. 
We do, however, now expect the SG&A investment to reach only $100 million this year versus the $120 million we discussed last quarter due to reducing the SG&A investment plan to partially fund the $40 million investment in Services pricing that I just discussed. 
Let me now turn to holiday. We are excited by what we are offering and delivering to our customers during this holiday shopping season. First, we have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products, especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, Appliances, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday season. 
Second, we have built some terrific new capabilities since last year, including: number one, a range of new digital capabilities, especially Blue Assist that I described earlier; number two, an additional 1,100 stores-within-a-store, which come on top of the over 3,700 we had a year ago; number three, the increasing expertise and proficiency of our sales people; number four, our enhanced multichannel delivery capabilities, illustrated by faster shipping, which is enabled by ship-from-store and a better in-store pickup experience; number five, the optimization of our supply chain to enable earlier store replenishments and higher order fill rates; and number six, a range of services offered to our customers, including free Geek Squad setup on top tech gifts and the ability for customers to give a gift of a Geek Squad agent's time. 
Also, from a marketing perspective, we believe we are entering the quarter with a high-performing media campaign, a significantly greater social media presence and more refined personalization capabilities through our investment in our Athena database. We, of course, recognize that we are up against a strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year and that the NPD industry decline that we saw in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, may continue throughout this year's fourth quarter. We have also made incremental investments in Services pricing and SG&A that are putting pressure on our fourth quarter earnings outlook, which Sharon will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Now one thing we are certain about is our team's ability to execute exceptionally well throughout the holiday. We're going into the holiday clear on our priorities and our plan and with a better trained, engaged and most importantly, highly determined team. I am grateful for what they've accomplished so far this year and extremely proud of their capabilities and passion to win. I know that they are ready to deliver an outstanding performance this holiday. 
I'll now turn the call to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook."
255397,315848614,906873,"Best Buy Co., Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 19, 2015",2015-11-19,"Earnings Calls","Best Buy Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expec",1594,"Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. 
Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.8% exceeded our expectations due to a Domestic $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed service plan portfolio and better-than-expected profitability in our International business. 
Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 37.1% versus our expectations of 39% to 40%, resulting in additional $0.01 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. 
Again, Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 2.4%, driven primarily by the Canadian brand consolidation, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian economy. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 21% to $0.41. This increase was primarily driven by a stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business and the $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit that I just discussed. These increases were partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and the lapping of a prior year inventory-related legal settlement of $0.02 that did not recur this year. 
In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 0.5%, excluding the benefit from installment billing; an estimated 30 basis point benefit associated with installment billing; and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. 
Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.3%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 130 basis points to 8.8%, versus 7.5% last year. 
From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen television was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and Services. 
In Services, comparable revenue declined 11.1%, almost entirely due to lower repair revenue, and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates of our traditional warranty plan. As we explained last quarter, the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranty has had the impact of reducing our repair revenue. While at face value, this appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial, because this repair revenue produces very little profit, and it is contributing to the positive performance of the externally managed portfolio. 
Additionally, in Q3, as Hubert discussed, we increased our investment in Services pricing as we expand and improve our price competitiveness in this category, particularly in computing and tablets. The impact of this price investment is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and throughout next year, of course. 
As we are discussing Services, I'd like to take a moment to provide more insight into the periodic profit-sharing benefits we are receiving from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio, as they have positively impacted our gross profit rate and earnings the last 2 quarters. And we are expecting a positive 55 basis point impact in Q4. These periodic benefits have been driven by substantial changes we have made to our insured warranty plan from both a plan design and cost-to-fulfill perspective. The portfolio has also seen an overall industry reduction in frequency of claims. All of these positive loss drivers have resulted in an overall lower-than-expected cost of our extended service plans, and we contractually share in that outperformance. As these periodic benefits are based on actual claims history of the externally managed portfolio, however, it is difficult to estimate any future potential impact, but we do not currently expect to see the same level of periodic profit-sharing benefits in fiscal '17. 
Now I will continue with our Q3 results. In our International segment, revenue declined 29.9% to $729 million due to the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry overall. 
Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.9%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 24.1%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, which we will begin lapping in Q4; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category; a greater portion of vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A; and a 20 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the 15 basis point prior year inventory-related legal settlement I just discussed. 
The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.4%. While both Canada and Mexico had higher year-over-year gross profit rates, a higher mix of sales from our Mexico business, which carries a lower gross profit rate, drove the 20 basis point International rate decline. 
Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 21.1% of revenue, an increase of $4 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.9% of revenues, an increase of $67 million or 60 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the flow-through of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. 
International non-GAAP SG&A was $171 million or 23.5% of revenue, a decrease of $63 million, but a rate increase of 100 basis points. This dollar increase is primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. The 100 basis point increase is driven by the year-over-year sales deleverage. 
As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred a better-than-expected negative impact of $0.02 of non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter. This was the result of a more effective promotional strategy, partially offset by a weaker-than-expected Canadian economy and consumer electronics market and from a lesser extent, lower costs from our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year. 
As such, we are narrowing our estimated EPS impact of the consolidation this year to a range of negative $0.10 to $0.12, versus our previous estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.17. This expectation is broken down as follows: The negative $0.04 that we've incurred in the first 9 months of this year and a negative $0.06 to $0.08 in Q4. 
Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. 
From a balance sheet perspective in the third quarter, we returned over $140 million in cash to our shareholders, $64 million through share repurchases and $79 million in regular dividends, bringing our year-to-date total cash returned to over $800 million. 
Also during the quarter, Fitch returned our debt rating to investment grade. 
I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, we are excited about our holiday plans and new capabilities and confident in our ability to execute our plans. This gives us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry. However, the 4.3% decline we saw in the NPD-reported categories got progressively worse throughout the quarter, which adds a level of caution to our outlook. 
With that, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q4 fiscal '16 is as follows: in the Domestic business, we are expecting near-flat revenue, assuming industry declines in the NPD-recorded categories are in line with Q3 at approximately negative 4%, and that the timing of the Super Bowl shift results in approximately 40 basis points of sales moving out of Q4 into Q1 fiscal '17; and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points, driven by gross profit rate pressure and higher SG&A. 
The gross profit rate pressure is primarily driven by a 25 basis point investment in Services pricing, higher distribution cost associated with our growth in the online channel and the appliance and large-screen television categories and product mix and product cycle pressures. Largely offsetting these gross profit pressures is the expected 55 basis point periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. The higher SG&A is due to our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost savings. 
In the International business, due to the ongoing impact of the Canadian brand consolidation, foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian market, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of positive 2% to 3%. 
With these expectations, our enterprise-level outlook is as follows: a negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 25 to 45 basis points. 
From a tax rate perspective, we expect a non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% versus 34.2% last year, which is expected to result in a negative $0.04 to $0.06 year-over-year in Q4 '16.

What we're very clear about is what we control, and as we said, we're extremely well positioned to deliver. Clearly, we've been gaining market share, and so that gives us enormous confidence. Exactly what's going to be the demand during the quarter? You've seen a lot of volatility across retail categories in the last few months. So we've noted these facts. We want to be transparent with our shareholders. Our forecast reflects everything we know at this point, and you see us determined to -- irrespective of what's going to happen in the market, there's so much we control, and what we've put in place, the capabilities we have, allow us to win. And so we're in this to win this. And so I'm afraid that it's hard to directly answer your question about exactly what the demand is going to be, but we've tried our best today to give you as much transparency as possible around the categories. I would say there's a lot of excitement in a number of product categories. I mean, TVs, the demand for 4K TVs in our customer experience in this category is a great example of what we can accomplish. Appliances is less of a giftable item, maybe, but our momentum continues to be strong in the market, and that category continues to be very strong. There's a lot of excitement in health and wearables, connected devices. I'm planning to buy a drone myself, so if you want to join me, but there's these recent trends we saw at the end of the quarter that we wanted to highlight for our investors in this period of transparency."

Because remember, the first Black Friday deals were released in the first week of November. By some retailers, second week, they were -- we released 8 deals. So that -- we'll just follow through on that. And October was the most notable month during the 3-month period. As you pointed out, there are categories that are outside of that. Appliances is another category that is actually outside of NPD. And with that, we saw exceptional growth again this quarter, and we are so encouraged by the work that we're doing on the Appliance side. In the mobile category, we did see, I believe -- we believe the industry grew. Knowing what the industry did for mobile is very difficult, but we do believe if you look just at units that there was growth.

We think we have a long runway. If you average our market share across all of the categories in which we compete, it's around 15%. Now of course, it varies by product categories and types of customers, but our share of wallet of existing customers is not that high. So jokingly, I tell our teams as long as we're below 90% market share, we have a long runway. As you can appreciate, they love that. Clearly, we have a lot of runway to continue to grow. And then, of course, we're going to play where the puck is going. This industry and our business is characterized by waves of technology, and planning where the next waves are is something that Best Buy is very good at. And as the business moves to the connected devices, the Internet of Things, we are extremely well positioned to win these waves.

My follow-up question is, Hubert, the fourth quarter in the consumer electronics space is a little different than the first 3 quarters of the year. The first 3 quarters of the year, you have to be price competitive against other players who are trafficking in consumer electronics. In the fourth quarter, in the holiday, you're competing against other product categories for wallet share. So I think everyone appreciates that your prices on consumer electronics for the Black Friday ad are competitive, but how do you think about the cross-price elasticity of demand? So if sweaters are going to be 75% off, perhaps that will look more compelling to a consumer over the next couple of months versus buying a TV that may not have as much of a discount. And if we see that shape up, will you have to get progressively more promotional as we get closer to Christmas? Especially in light of what looks like pretty heavy inventory positions, given that your inventory outpaced your sales by a few basis points. Wal-Mart and Target talked about their weakness in consumer electronics, and so arguably, the industry's heading into this holiday with a pretty heavy industry -- inventory position."

There is, indeed, a risk that I mentioned that we've talked about, which is the -- if the industry is soft, then there's this risk of people being desperate and liquidating their inventory. We don't think that's the main thesis at this point in time. But going back to the fight against the sweaters, our teams completely understand that. I mean, I'm very proud of our team, and which is one of the reasons why we bought early, and often, we start our marketing campaigns early in the season. You've seen us, in fact, before the end of October starting to talk to customers because we want to be front and center. I think that in the apparel category, I think you've seen a lot of softness, frankly. But somehow, the products in that category don't seem to be resonating that well with consumers. And in many ways, the consumer market and consumer electronics in particular, great supply creates demand, and I think the products we have, the assortment, the customer experience can be extremely exciting. If you gave me time, I could try to sell each one of you on the call some great products, but I'm not sure Sharon would let me do that. So we -- yes, we understand it's a broader battle. We understand the game is different, and we play it slightly differently than in the rest of the year, focusing on product, product availability, being price competitive and being very convenient with delivery. Our free 2-day delivery capabilities are very significant. So you can feel how excited and good we feel about this fight. Bring them over. We're ready."

When you look at the outside of Best Buy industry data points about what people believe is going to be big sellers for holiday, even NPD put out a holiday outlook. And within that, one of the top categories that they expected was around video games and tech-type items. In addition to that, they thought that one of the biggest sellers this holiday, big drivers of holiday, is going to be big screen TVs, where we continue to have such substantial share, and as you guys know, probably the best assortment in all of retail. So we are so prepared to take advantage of those, as Hubert pointed out, and we discussed in the prepared remarks. Our inventories are probably in the best position that we've ever entered a fourth quarter in recent history, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that. And reminder that it's hard to execute when you are going into these categories that carry such large cubes. You really need capabilities in that area. I don't -- whether you're selling it through the stores or selling it online, you need very strong capabilities. Not everyone is going to come out of the chute really great at this. So I think there are a list of competitive advantage, but there are numerous external data points that you can research that are saying that this is going to be a very strong category this holiday."

The first thing I think we all have to recognize is the nature of this industry is to have some volatility, right? Because it's so hit driven, product innovation driven and so forth. I think we also have to remember that Q2 was relatively better compared to previous trends. So we saw a difference. The most significant in a sense is the change in trajectory within the quarter that was quite significant. What exactly drove the change in trajectory was -- there's 2 aspects. One is it was broad based, but then there's some product-specific elements. I think it's a widespread elements that's widely known is the decline -- the sharp declines of tablets. It is -- this is a category in which we have a very large market share, of course, so it impacts us. But from an industry standpoint, there was a significant decline in that. Now since then, there's been new product introductions that we can all be very familiar with. Does the weather plays a role. I think the apparel players would have spoken about this. Our science is not sophisticated enough. The people, in particular in Minnesota, like to go to their lake rather than shopping. It's not -- don't think so, okay? So that's the color I would give. Looking ahead, again to the extent that there is amazing great products and so forth, number one, it can help the industry, and certainly will help us, and we will take advantage of it.

So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering with the Geek Squad services for computing and tablet. We launched that on September 13 with Geek Squad Protect and Support Plus. And we also launched AppleCare with ramping up our Apple service provider capabilities. So we've changed the offering, moving away from pure warranties to something that is helpful to customers, and we've materially lowered the price. I think that this is something -- we've been consistent in wanting to be price competitive. Our field, our stores are very excited about this. The service offering is very good. We've seen initial pickup in the attach rates. We're very excited about that. We also know that perceptions change slowly, and like our previous investments, we do expect that it's going to take time before it pickups fully. We don't expect in this category to completely offset -- to have the elasticity completely offset the price investments, but we do expect to make progress. But the actions we're taking to help the customers be aware of that is the training and the proficiency of our Blue Shirts and of course the Geek Squad agents. We're also investing on the site. And I think that in the quarters ahead, we'll see continued progress. More broadly -- because this is just one small first step in our Services strategy. And if you step back, what we've said is that Services is actually playing -- will play a bigger role than just being a revenue and profit center. Services for us can be a part of the value proposition. So if you're going to buy a big TV, if it's going to be above 55 or 60 inches, you want somebody to deliver it and install it for you and do it really well. And of course, we have unique capabilities. We also see Services being a growth driver. So when we have somebody coming to your house, who understand your needs and build a solution for you, we're not going to charge for the in-home visit, but this is -- this has the ability to drive business, and we see it today with our Magnolia Design Centers and there's more where it's coming from. And then as we continue to innovate our Services and evolve the positioning of the brand, you're going to see it appear more and more in our various marketing vehicles. It's true today a little bit on the site. It's truing the circular in our -- in the stores. With everything we've done, and that's going to be consistent in the last 3 years of our transformation, it's gradual and incremental. We've started that journey, and you're going to see us continue moving forward in that direction. So more to come."

And then in addition to that, the tax rate last year at 34.5%, going up to the current rate, is going to cost us about $0.05 to $0.06. So on a -- if you just go back and you take those up against last year, that really puts last year's EPS at about $1.35 on a comparable basis to what we have this year. Then when you go into the outlook I gave you, we talked about the fact that we've got the 25 basis point investment in Services pricing. So that's going to come off the gross profit, right? We have the higher distribution costs associated with growth in the online channel and then the appliance and large-screen TV -- large cube costs will hit us in Q4. Of course, we're going to have the revenue as well. And then there's some product mix issues that are -- we're expecting to hit us in Q4. And then all of those downsides will be offset by the 50 basis point -- it's actually 55 basis point profit-sharing benefit. So when you're really thinking about this outlook, when you get down to the EPS range that you get when you take the Enterprise level reduction on the OI rate, quite frankly, it is not look -- it's starting to look a lot like last year and, maybe, even on the high end a little bit better."

We put deductibles in on the phone repair, which we were the only ones in the industry, historically, that didn't have one. You'll recall that. We had some plans that were multiyear plans. We have had repair reductions, where we're doing the repairs. We're sourcing parts differently. There are all kinds of changes that we have made in the last couple of years, Greg, that operationally are driving this. In addition, at the same time, that we were making operational improvements around the fulfillment of claims associated with the extended warranties, from an industry point of view, and this is really a quality -- vendor quality point of view. The devices have been extremely durable, and we have not seen the frequency of claims. So the combination of those are driving that. Now I can tell you that in fiscal '17 in the prepared remarks, we said we do not know what this will be, and we do not believe it'll be as high as it is this year. There will be next year; it will come in Q4. There will be some level, our gut tells us. You never know for sure, but we believe there will be a periodic payment next year. This year, I think it is -- we think it is unusually high. In addition, there's the premium to be paid. Every time we sell a new warranty, there will be premiums that we pay to the insurer to take on that liability. And because of these factors, our premiums went down in the back half of this year. They will continue into next year and then on top of that, we will see another likely premium assessment downward next year.

And so as we look ahead with our various vendors in the various parts of our stores, we'll want to continue to optimize that, so that we win with the customers, something we want to win for our vendors, but we also want to win for us and drive -- continue to drive great outcomes. When you are in our stores -- and of course, every store is different, but there are some stores where these stores-within-a-store with the addition of the Pacific Kitchen & Home, and Magnolia Design Centers today occupy a large part of the stores. So they're a big part of our winning with customers.
So in summary, we feel a great quarter in Q3, we -- the combination of online revenue growth and margin expansion in Q3 in the environment that we're all familiar with is the great outcome. Hopefully, you felt our excitement for Q4. Hopefully, you felt that we try to provide as much color as possible on the outlook, and we'll see you either in stores or online. Remember to shake your phone with the app to get access to our agents and Blue Shirt. And thank you for your continued support in the company. Have a great day, great holiday, everyone."
