We're pleased with our Q1 results which reflect continued market share gains, healthy returns and a strong start to fiscal year 2015. Sales grew over 10% to $4.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth accelerating on a one and a 2-year basis. With broad-based momentum across departments, storage, classes and regions, we believe our many strategic initiatives, along with improving consumer confidence, are collectively contributing to our improve results. 
Here are some of the highlights of our progress in Q1. We launched our Values Matter national brand campaign, which you may have seen in TV and print several times over the last few months. It is a real boost to team member morale, and we're looking forward to the final brand tracking results. The early read is very positive, indicating 100% increase in awareness for our target audience, with increases in both value perception and intent to shop versus our measured competitors. We are now providing fresh grocery delivery options to more homes in America than any other food retailer. Since announcing our 15-market partnership with Instacart in September, our average weekly online delivery sales have already passed the $1 million mark. With online delivery sales as high as 5% of total sales in some of our stores, we're very excited about the future potential as we expand our reach to more markets, provide richer content highlighting our quality standards and broaden our product offering. A great example is happening this week for Valentine's Day. We're offering delivery in as little as 1 hour with prices starting at $25 for a dozen of our high-quality, ethically sourced whole trade roses. Orders can be placed in advance and combined with the ability to include chocolates or some other treats, this is a deal that's hard to beat. We're the largest Apple Pay retailer in terms of both transactions and sales, further reinforcing the notion that our customer base wants to take advantage of the latest digital technologies. This payment option has grown quickly to 2% of sales which we expect will continue to increase, especially after the Apple Watch launches this year. We are exploring opportunities to extend this successful partnership, including expanding functionality to support our affinity program. 
Speaking of, we are pleased with the results of our 12-store affinity test, which shows high activation and registration rates and above average basket sizes for participants. We are continuing to incorporate customer feedback as we upgrade and add new features to this program and recently added some new talent to lead our efforts in this area. We're excited to expand the pilot to our Washington, D.C. customers this spring, with hopes of having the program live in the majority of our stores for the 2015 holiday season. And as promised, our new and improved Whole Foods Market app is now live, with nearly 600,000 downloads to date, iOS/Android users can access personalized and local store offers, events and information, along with 3,700 tested recipes where ingredients can be added to shopping lists with a single tap. Stay tuned for more unique and exciting features and updates throughout the year. 
We recognize the changing technology and growing demand for customization and fundamentally altered retailing parameter. Customers expect to connect with the brand whenever, wherever and however they choose. And as part of our broader digital road map, we are rapidly getting out an extended customer experience beyond the 4 walls of our stores. At the same time, we believe customers will always want the human connection, the sense of community and the unparalleled shopping environment our stores deliver. As we accelerate our new store openings and step up refreshes of our older stores, we are focused on evolving a richer customer experience through innovation, improved value and higher levels of transparency on all the products that we sell. 
In Q1, we opened 9 stores, expanding into Ottawa, Canada and revitalizing our brand with new large flagships in both Houston and Boston. We're opening our first tap room in 2010, we now have over 100 tap rooms and wine bars company-wide. Our Post Oak store in Houston took the next step beating our first-ever in-store microbrewery, our second brewery is already open and we expect many more to come. We refreshed 40 stores and are on track to complete 200 by year-end. While results vary depending on the scope of the project and a variety of other factors, stores typically see an immediate sales lift and we expect these investments to be one of the many factors contributing to sales momentum this year and beyond. We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce price that we are testing in several markets, which include external marketing to support these investments. It is too early for conclusive results, particularly given the holidays. However, we're looking at expanding the test to additional markets as we believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception. We launched our Responsibly Grown rating system, which assesses growing practices and impact human health and the environment and prohibits some of the most harmful pesticides. We believe these ratings draw clear lines of differentiation between our produce and our floral departments than those of our competitors. The program has been well-received by suppliers and customers and close to 60% of our produce is already rated. We have seen the power of our differentiated standards in other areas such as meat and seafood and believe our Responsibly Grown ratings of produce will see similar success over time. And after just 2 years of setting a deadline for full GMO transparency by 2018, we are well on our way with over 25,000 Certified Organic items in over 8,500 non-GMO project verified products in our stores. 
Turning back now to the results -- our results, sales increased 10% driven by comps of 4.5% and square footage growth of 9.4%. a 20 basis points decline in gross margin was partially offset by a 4 basis point improvement in SG&A. It remains our intention to offset the impact of our strategic initiatives with improvements in our cost structure over the longer term. However, the timing of investments and the cost cuts may not align as was the case this quarter. Excluding $13 million or 28 basis points of estimated incremental marketing costs related to the launch of our brand campaign, SG&A improved 33 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits, more than offsetting the 20 basis point decline in gross margin. EBITDA margin was 8.5% and EPS increased 10% to $0.46. For the last 8 quarters, our new store class has averaged sales per -- gross square foot of $709, translating the productivity levels of 82% on a weighted square footage basis. Comp stores less than 2 years old have averaged 70% -- 17% comps and most importantly, a 14% return on invested capital well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Please see our press release for more details on our outlook for this year and note that we estimate this year's Easter shift will possibly impact comps in Q2 and negatively impact comps in Q3 by about 50 to 60 basis points. 
As we look forward, we see more opportunity for the Whole Foods Market brand than ever before. We have a deep and seasoned leadership team and we've added some fantastic new talent. Our strong and vibrant culture contributes to low turnover and high morale, which helps create a great customer experience. The demand for fresh healthy foods continues to surge, and we are best-positioned to benefit as the leading retailer of natural organic growth in America's Healthiest Grocery Store. We are committed and continuing to improve and evolve, and with 408 stores and 116 sign leases, we have confidence that we will cross the 500 store mark in 2017 and triple our store base over the longer term. 
We will now take questions. Call will end at 4:45 p.m. Central Time, [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And yet we have very loyal customers. So we'll begin to get more of the convenience business through Instacart than we've ever had before, because let's say they come to Whole Foods, they have to drive past other supermarkets to come to Whole Foods, and they do that maybe once a week, or once every couple of weeks. But now with Instacart, if they need to pick up a quart of milk or they need to pick up some berries for their cereal, they can just order from Instacart, they don't need to go drive over to one of our competitors who might be closer than Whole Foods. So I think there will be some cannibalization, of course, there will be some incremental sales that we get. And so as Walter and David said, it's so early, I mean, it so early in this. We got so much information a year from now than we have today, but all we can say is it's growing very rapidly. Our customers love it and we're really happy with it."

We're pleased with our Q1 results which reflect continued market share gains, healthy returns and a strong start to fiscal year 2015. Sales grew over 10% to $4.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth accelerating on a 1- and a 2-year basis. With broad-based momentum across departments, store age classes and regions, we believe our many strategic initiatives, along with improving consumer confidence, are collectively contributing to our improved results.
Here are some of the highlights of our progress in Q1.
We launched our Values Matter national brand campaign, which you may have seen on TV and in print several times over the last few months. It was a real boost to team member morale, and we're looking forward to the final brand-tracking study results. The early read is very positive, indicating 100% increase in awareness for our target audience, with increases in both value perception and intent to shop versus our measured competitors.
We are now providing fresh grocery delivery options to more homes in America than any other food retailer. Since announcing our 15-market partnership with Instacart in September, our average weekly online delivery sales have already passed the $1 million mark. With online delivery sales as high as 5% of total sales in some of our stores, we're very excited about the future potential as we expand our reach to more markets, provide richer content highlighting our quality standards, and broaden our product offering.
A great example is happening this week for Valentine's Day. We're offering floral delivery in as little as 1 hour, with prices starting at $25 for a dozen of our high-quality, ethically sourced Whole Trade roses. Orders can be placed in advance, and combined with the ability to include chocolates or some other treats, this is a deal that's hard to beat.
We're the largest Apple Pay retailer in terms of both transactions and sales, further reinforcing the notion that our customer base wants to take advantage of the latest digital technologies. This payment option has grown quickly to 2% of sales, which we expect will continue to increase, especially after the Apple Watch launches this year. We are exploring opportunities to extend this successful partnership, including expanding functionality to support our Affinity program. 
Speaking of, we are pleased with the results of our 12-store Affinity test, which shows high activation and registration rates and above-average basket sizes for participants. We are continuing to incorporate customer feedback as we upgrade and add new features to this program, and recently added some new talent to lead our efforts in this area. We're excited to expand the pilot to our Washington, D.C. customers this spring, with hopes of having the program live in a majority of our stores for the 2015 holiday season.
And as promised, our new and improved Whole Foods Market app is now live, with nearly 600,000 downloads to date. iOS, Android users can access personalized and local store offers, events and information, along with 3,700 tested recipes where ingredients can be added to shopping lists with a single tap. Stay tuned for more unique and exciting features and upgrades throughout the year. 
We recognize the changing technology and growing demand for customization have fundamentally altered retailing forever. Customers now expect to connect with a brand whenever, wherever and however they choose. And as part of our broader digital road map, we are rapidly building out an extended customer experience beyond the 4 walls of our stores. At the same time, we believe customers will always want the human connection, the sense of community and the unparalleled shopping environment our stores deliver. As we accelerate our new store openings and step up refreshes of our oldest stores, we are focused on evolving a richer customer experience through innovation, improved value and higher levels of transparency on all the products that we sell.
In Q1, we opened 9 new stores, expanding into Ottawa, Canada and revitalizing our brand with new large flagships in both Houston and Boston. After opening our first taproom in 2010, we now have over 100 taprooms and wine bars company-wide.
Our Post Oak store in Houston took the next step, debuting our first-ever in-store microbrewery. Our second brewery is already opened, and we expect many more to come.
We refreshed 40 stores and are on track to complete 200 by year-end. While results vary depending on the scope of the project and a variety of other factors, stores typically see an immediate sales lift, and we expect these investments to be one of the many factors contributing to sales momentum this year and beyond.
We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce price we are testing in several markets, which included external marketing to support these investments. It is too early for conclusive results, particularly given the holidays; however, we're looking at expanding the test to additional markets as we believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception.
We launched our Responsibly Grown rating system, which assesses growing practices that impact human health and the environment and prohibits some of the most harmful pesticides. We believe these ratings draw clear lines of differentiation between our produce and our floral departments than those of our competitors. The program has been well-received by suppliers and customers, and close to 60% of our produce is already rated. We have seen the power of our differentiated standards in other areas, such as meat and seafood, and believe our Responsibly Grown ratings in produce will see similar success over time.
And after just 2 years of setting a deadline for full GMO transparency by 2018, we are well on our way with over 25,000 certified organic items in over 8,500 Non-GMO Project Verified products in our stores.
Turning back now to the results, our results. Sales increased 10% driven by comps of 4.5% and square footage growth of 9.4%. A 20-basis-point decline in gross margin was partially offset by a 4-basis-point improvement in SG&A. It remains our intention to offset the impact of our strategic initiatives with improvements in our cost structure over the longer term. However, the timing of investments and the cost cuts may not align, as was the case this quarter.
Excluding $13 million or 28 basis points of estimated incremental marketing costs related to the launch of our brand campaign, SG&A improved 33 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits, more than offsetting the 20-basis-point decline in gross margin. EBITDA margin was 8.5%, and EPS increased 10% to $0.46.
For the last 8 quarters, our new store class has averaged sales per square -- gross square foot of $709, translating the productivity levels of 82% on a weighted square footage basis. Comp stores less than 2 years old have averaged 70% -- 17% comps, and most importantly, a 14% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
Please see our press release for more details on our outlook for this year and note that we estimate this year's Easter shift will positively impact comps in Q2 and negatively impact comps in Q3 by about 50 to 60 basis points.
As we look forward, we see more opportunity for the Whole Foods Market brand than ever before. We have a deep and seasoned leadership team and been adding some fantastic new talent. Our strong and vibrant culture contributes to low turnover and high morale, which helps create a great customer experience. The demand for fresh healthy foods continues to surge, and we are best-positioned to benefit as the leading retailer of natural and organic foods and America's Healthiest Grocery Store. We are committed to continuing to improve and evolve, and with 408 stores and 116 signed leases, we have confidence that we will cross the 500-store mark in 2017 and triple our store base over the longer term.
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 p.m. Central time. [Operator Instructions]

I mean, we're very proud that we took out over 200 basis points on our cost structure in the last 5 years, and I think it's reasonable to conclude we can do the same thing on a go-forward basis. But it just requires a lot of hard work. I mean, obviously, if we knew exactly the big areas to cut, we'd already have done that. So it's about working at it, studying it, putting -- making it a priority, which is what our regional presidents are doing and our executive vice presidents for operations. We're very conscious of the fact that we need to take cost out of our system, and we've done it in the past, and we're going to continue to do it going forward."

We're pleased with our Q1 results which reflect continued market share gains, healthy returns and a strong start to fiscal year 2015. Sales grew over 10% to $4.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth accelerating on a 1- and a 2-year basis. With broad-based momentum across departments, store age classes and regions, we believe our many strategic initiatives, along with improving consumer confidence, are collectively contributing to our improved results.
Here are some of the highlights of our progress in Q1.
We launched our Values Matter national brand campaign, which you may have seen on TV and in print several times over the last few months. It was a real boost to team member morale, and we're looking forward to the final brand-tracking study results. The early read is very positive, indicating 100% increase in awareness for our target audience, with increases in both value perception and intent to shop versus our measured competitors.
We are now providing fresh grocery delivery options to more homes in America than any other food retailer. Since announcing our 15-market partnership with Instacart in September, our average weekly online delivery sales have already passed the $1 million mark. With online delivery sales as high as 5% of total sales in some of our stores, we're very excited about the future potential as we expand our reach to more markets, provide richer content highlighting our quality standards, and broaden our product offering.
A great example is happening this week for Valentine's Day. We're offering floral delivery in as little as 1 hour, with prices starting at $25 for a dozen of our high-quality, ethically sourced Whole Trade roses. Orders can be placed in advance, and combined with the ability to include chocolates or some other treats, this is a deal that's hard to beat.
We're the largest Apple Pay retailer in terms of both transactions and sales, further reinforcing the notion that our customer base wants to take advantage of the latest digital technologies. This payment option has grown quickly to 2% of sales, which we expect will continue to increase, especially after the Apple Watch launches this year. We are exploring opportunities to expand this successful partnership, including expanding functionality to support our Affinity program. 
Speaking of, we are pleased with the results of our 12-store Affinity test, which shows high activation and registration rates and above-average basket sizes for participants. We are continuing to incorporate customer feedback as we upgrade and add new features to this program, and recently added some new talent to lead our efforts in this area. We're excited to expand the pilot to our Washington, D.C. customers this spring, with hopes of having the program live in a majority of our stores for the 2015 holiday season.
And as promised, our new and improved Whole Foods Market app is now live, with nearly 600,000 downloads to date. iOS, Android users can access personalized and local store offers, events and information, along with 3,700 tested recipes where ingredients can be added to shopping lists with a single tap. Stay tuned for more unique and exciting features and upgrades throughout the year. 
We recognize that changing technology and growing demand for customization have fundamentally altered retailing forever. Customers now expect to connect with a brand whenever, wherever and however they choose. And as part of our broader digital road map, we are rapidly building out an extended customer experience beyond the 4 walls of our stores. At the same time, we believe customers will always want the human connection, the sense of community and the unparalleled shopping environment our stores deliver. As we accelerate our new store openings and step up refreshes of our oldest stores, we are focused on evolving a richer customer experience through innovation, improved value and higher levels of transparency on all the products that we sell.
In Q1, we opened 9 new stores, expanding into Ottawa, Canada and revitalizing our brand with new large flagships in both Houston and Boston. After opening our first taproom in 2010, we now have over 100 taprooms and wine bars company-wide.
Our Post Oak store in Houston took the next step, debuting our first-ever in-store microbrewery. Our second brewery is already opened, and we expect many more to come.
We refreshed 40 stores and are on track to complete 200 by year-end. While results vary depending on the scope of the project and a variety of other factors, stores typically see an immediate sales lift, and we expect these investments to be one of the many factors contributing to sales momentum this year and beyond.
We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce prices we are testing in several markets, which included external marketing to support these investments. It is too early for conclusive results, particularly given the holidays; however, we're looking at expanding the test to additional markets as we believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception.
We launched our Responsibly Grown rating system, which assesses growing practices that impact human health and the environment and prohibits some of the most harmful pesticides. We believe these ratings draw clear lines of differentiation between our produce and our floral departments than those of our competitors. The program has been well-received by suppliers and customers, and close to 60% of our produce is already rated. We have seen the power of our differentiated standards in other areas, such as meat and seafood, and believe our Responsibly Grown ratings in produce will see similar success over time.
And after just 2 years of setting a deadline for full GMO transparency by 2018, we are well on our way with over 25,000 certified organic items in over 8,500 Non-GMO Project Verified products in our stores.
Turning back now to the results-- our results. Sales increased 10% driven by comps of 4.5% and square footage growth of 9.4%. A 20-basis-point decline in gross margin was partially offset by a 4-basis-point improvement in SG&A. It remains our intention to offset the impact of our strategic initiatives with improvements in our cost structure over the longer term. However, the timing of investments and the cost cuts may not align, as was the case this quarter.
Excluding $13 million or 28 basis points of estimated incremental marketing costs related to the launch of our brand campaign, SG&A improved 33 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits, more than offsetting the 20-basis-point decline in gross margin. EBITDA margin was 8.5%, and EPS increased 10% to $0.46.
For the last 8 quarters, our new store class has averaged sales per square -- gross square foot of $709, translating the productivity levels of 82% on a weighted square footage basis. Comp stores less than 2 years old have averaged 70% -- 17% comps, and most importantly, a 14% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
Please see our press release for more details on our outlook for this year and note that we estimate this year's Easter shift will positively impact comps in Q2 and negatively impact comps in Q3 by about 50 to 60 basis points.
As we look forward, we see more opportunity for the Whole Foods Market brand than ever before. We have a deep and seasoned leadership team and have been adding some fantastic new talent. Our strong and vibrant culture contributes to low turnover and high morale, which helps create a great customer experience. The demand for fresh healthy foods continues to surge, and we are best-positioned to benefit as the leading retailer of natural and organic foods and America's Healthiest Grocery Store. We are committed to continuing to improve and evolve, and with 408 stores and 116 signed leases, we have confidence that we will cross the 500-store mark in 2017 and triple our store base over the longer term.
We will now take questions.  [Operator Instructions]

We've never been, and we never will be, trying to be the lowest-priced supermarket. That's sort of not very attractive, doesn't give very good service. That's not what we're about. I mean, that's a valid niche in the marketplace just to try to be the low-priced, low-cost operator, but that's not Whole Foods' strategy. Our strategy has always been about the quality and the service and the selection. And yes, I mean, competition is harder today than it used to be, but on the other hand, Whole Foods is a lot better today than it used to be. In fact, competition -- it is your ally. It's your ally that helps you to get better. It knocks you out of your complacency. It keeps you from being lazy. It forces you to evolve. And Whole Foods Markets is a very competitive company. And when we are challenged, when competition rears its head, we respond. And that's what we're doing right now. We're responding. We're evolving. We're getting better. We're getting better quicker than our competitors are. So they're chasing us still, and maybe they have closed the gap a little bit, but we're accelerating our innovation cycle. So I think that's something people have never understood about Whole Foods Market. They think we're going to sit still and let people catch us, but we're not going to sit still. We're going to rapidly innovate and improve. That's what we've done for over 35 years, and that's what we're going to do going forward."

In Q2, our sales increased 10% to $3.6 billion driven by comps of 3.6% and square footage growth of 11%. We opened 11 new stores, including 3 relocations and 3 former Dominick's locations. There are many moving",1036,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, our sales increased 10% to $3.6 billion driven by comps of 3.6% and square footage growth of 11%. We opened 11 new stores, including 3 relocations and 3 former Dominick's locations. There are many moving pieces so we can't definitively -- say definitively what caused the moderation comps during the quarter. We do know that we are not immune to the larger macro environment and the exploding demand for natural organic products has resulted in increased competition from many different channels. In addition, severe weather and cannibalization had a larger impact in Q2 than in Q1. We're on track to report our sixth consecutive year of record new store openings. A high percentage of our accelerated growth is in existing markets, which is driving market share gains but also producing a drag on comps from higher cannibalization in some cases. We saw this in Austin and Boston last year and we're seeing it in Chicago and Florida right now. Keep in mind that our average weekly sales per store are over $720,000. So even when a store gets hit, it is still highly profitable and continues to produce strong returns on invested capital. The store amount reports slower growth per year, but after anniversarying the new store opening, it regains momentum quickly. Gross margin excluding the nonroutine supplier credit declined 12 basis points due primarily to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. While we do our best to estimate the impact of our value efforts, it is more art than science and customer reactions can vary from our predictions. In addition, strong execution on the buy side helped offset our investments to a greater degree than we had forecast. For the fiscal year, we still expect a greater year-over-year decline in gross margin excluding LIFO than we saw last year. SG&A improved 29 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits. We're pleased with our continued expense discipline, particularly given comps were little light from our expectations. 
Turning to new stores, for the last 8 quarters, our new store class has averaged 36 stores with sales per gross square foot over $700, translating the productivity levels of 80% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 16% comps, and more importantly, a 13% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Our EVA-based approach to site selection allows us to consider markets from Kansas to New York City. While our expectations for sales productivity and operating expenses vary depending on the type of market and other factors, when balanced with the appropriate level of capital investment, a wide variety of markets can produce healthy returns for our shareholders. We are reaffirming our fiscal year targets, comps have averaged 2.8% over the last 5 weeks, up from 2.4% for the last 9 weeks of Q2 excluding Easter. We're encouraged by this improvement and are continuing to lean into the changing marketplace, moving forward with our investments, value, marketing and technology. We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce pricing we have implemented in several markets. We added more markets in Q2 and expect this to expand as the year progresses. We continue to believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception. We're continuing our successful Value Matters brand advertising campaign. Beginning next week, this next round will focus on digital marketing, including online video, digital display ads and mobile and social ads. In Q2, our average weekly Instacart sales increased to $1.5 million. We continue to be the leading Apple Pay retailer with over 3.3 million transactions and surpassed 4 million followers on Twitter. Given those metrics, it is not surprising that in our brand tracking results, digital outperformed with our key demographics. We plan to follow-up this fall with an exciting new Values Matter campaign which will include national television and digital. 
Now turning to other news, in our investor conference in February, I said we would be making some pretty exciting announcements over the coming months reflecting our ability to learn and grow and evolve. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of the new uniquely branded store concept unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace. Offering our industry-leading quality standards at value prices, this new format will feature modern streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection. We'll offer convenient, transparent and values-oriented experience geared towards millennial shoppers while appealing to anyone looking for high-quality fresh food at great prices. We're building a team to focus exclusively on this new concept and are already negotiating leases. We plan to begin opening stores next year, and given the more standardized design and product assortment, we expect a fairly rapid expansion from there. Over the next several years, we have explored the idea of new format several times but never felt the time was right, particularly given our accelerated growth plans. That issue is now behind us as we have successfully increased our new store openings for 6 years. In addition, we now have a successful track record of opening some smaller format stores with a lower cost structure. 
The Whole Foods market brand has helped lead the shifting consciousness toward fresh, healthy foods by offering the highest quality, broader selection and best customer service, and we believe we can still triple the number of Whole Foods market stores in the United States. At the same time, we have also seen an opportunity to leverage our long history of retail innovation and extend our reach into marketplace beyond 1,200 stores. We want to underscore we see this as an and to our Whole Foods market brand and not on or. We believe the growth potential for this new and complementary brand to be as great as it is for our highly successful Whole Foods Market brand.  This is all we're going to reveal today but we look forward to share more detail about this exciting news venture some time before Labor Day. 
We'll now take questions. Our call will end at 445 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

So we're well on our way for that. One thing to understand is, is that the market is exploding. I mean, it's incredible what's happening. I mean, one of the things that's fun to do at Whole Foods is we go back and we look at what our sales were per store 5 years ago, 8 years ago, 10 years ago. Our sales are so much higher, our sales per square foot is so much higher. At the same time we've been so successful that we've actually bred a lot more competition, and everybody's jumping kind of on the natural organic food bandwagon, and that's really, frankly, due to our success. So I don't see that there's a problem, but what I do think is that the Whole Foods Market brand is very targeted to a certain type of customer, certain type of shopper. We think the opportunity's a lot larger than that. And we think that our certain customers at the Whole Foods Market brand's attractive to, but there's are other customers that is less attractive to. We see a whole generation of young people coming up who are quite interested in natural organic foods. The millennial generation, they're idealistic, they're values-oriented, they're mission-driven, these all play to Whole Foods Market's strengths. They're also very value-conscious. So we think a streamlined, hip, cool technology-oriented store unlike any store anybody's ever seen before that has lower capital, lower cost, perhaps lower labor costs, and lower prices is going to be very, very attractive to that particular generation. So you can't envision it yet because it hasn't been created yet. We're creating yet. It will be new, it will be different, it will be unlike any of the other stores you've seen out there, and hey, sometimes you have to wait to see it but it will be worth waiting for."

So when we projected that we were going to do certain investments in price as it turns out because of the volume we move, we're able to actually negotiate a little bit better cost in that than we expected to.

We think it's going to be an exciting new concept. So these are the things that we're doing. Also in some ways the new competition is -- as much as the market's expanding, a lot of people get into it for the first time and they are going to temporarily gain some shares because for convenience standpoint, they migrate certain customers over. But then they anniversary that. So the question is whether they will be able to comp their comps, 2, 3, 4, 5 years down the road. And so, I mean, one of the things that people don't fully understand is that even if Whole Foods Market just stopped, I mean our comps went flat, we were at 0, our sales per square foot, our return on invested capital, our whole store operating model is still, frankly, light years better than just anybody on the other food retailers out there that are at least public that we have their data on. So it's going to take a long time before people can catch up with us, but we're not going to sit still. We're going to continue to innovate, we're going to continue to differentiate ourselves, our commitment to prepared foods, top the sales we do there.

So like we said before, we're not looking to race to the bottom. We're looking to be relevant on price so we can really, really have this conversation about quality. The second bucket with marketing specifically that is about communicating the differences because we do not just sell the same stuff. Markets sometimes wants to drop it down to lowest common denominator and while there are some common products, much of our product notes is different and I think the ability for us to communicate the the differences in our product and the product offerings that we're bringing to our customers is where we're really trying to go to these efforts, as well as create kind of a personal connection to the Affinity. Granted we've been a little slower perhaps than we should have been in terms of getting those things in place, but we are through the use of technology, building out and extending ourself where our customers are, whether it's Instacart or home delivery, which we're doing more than any other grocery store in America now, and we're really just getting started, whether it's through Affinity which builds a personal connection to customers who allow to customize their relationship with us. Whether it's through the ease of Apple Pay which will soon go to the next thing you know about which gives customers the easier, the most seamless experience, whether it's our improving app which ultimately these things can be put together to get customers integrated experience with Whole Foods digitally. All of those things are in the works, and I wish that we were doing them faster, but we're doing them as fast as we can do as we replace all of our foundational systems and technology to get there. Ultimately where we're going is to create this fuller, richer experience, physically and digitally, for our customers, as John says, we're taking these steps and we're doing it at a time when the marketplace is going through a huge transition. But make no mistake about it, we still have a tremendous amount of strength in this company."

So no one's saying that the size and opportunities is just enormous. I think we're all seeing that unfold daily.

And then say that's kind of the Whole Foods Market brand trajectory. And then you have this new format that is -- the stores are not as large, they're more streamlined, they're tech-savvy, there's less capital being invested in it, they're very convenient for people and they're very value-focused with a tailored product mix. So maybe if you go into a big Whole Foods Market, maybe you've got a thousand different kinds of wine from a price point all the way from $2.99 to a few hundred dollars, but maybe in our new concept store, you'll have a more tailored mix of wine. It would just be good quality value wines and they won't have the same upward trajectory. So is it something that's going to harm Whole Foods Market? We don't see it that way. We see it as complementary. We'll see that our loyalty card program will include both brands we see people crossing over in it. And -- but one of the things that I think I've learned from other businesses is you have to be willing to evolve with the marketplace. You have to be willing to do what it takes to serve your customers better and you can't not do that because it might possibly take sales from your existing flagship brand. You got to be willing to serve your customers where you find them. That would cause the Whole Foods Market flagship brand to evolve as we roll out our next brand, just like it's evolving right now with the competition that we're facing. So we see that there was a huge opportunity that the natural organic foods revolution is sweeping America. We intend to be -- continue to be the leader in this category for the rest of the century. And so we're evolving with the marketplace. We're going to create a new -- we are creating a new format, a new concept that's not been seen, that no one else has done, it's going to be unique and we think it's going to be very exciting to the customer base and we'll see what happens.

They'll come in and enjoy the big exciting Whole Foods Market and they'll do fill-in shops at the new concept and their stores will intermix with each other in a very unique way.

A high percentage of our accelerated growth is in existing markets, which is driving market share gains but also producing a drag on comps from higher cannibalization in some cases. We saw this in Austin and Boston last year, and we're seeing it in Chicago and Florida right now. Keep in mind that our average weekly sales per store are over $720,000. So even when a store gets hit, it is still highly profitable and continues to produce strong returns on invested capital. The store might report slower growth per year, but after anniversary-ing the new store opening, it regains momentum quickly. Gross margin, excluding the nonroutine supplier credit, declined 12 basis points due primarily to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. While we do our best to estimate the impact of our value efforts, it is more art than science and customer reactions can vary from our predictions. In addition, strong execution on the buy side helped offset our investments to a greater degree than we had forecast. For the fiscal year, we still expect a greater year-over-year decline in gross margin excluding LIFO than we saw last year. SG&A improved 29 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits. We're pleased with our continued expense disciplines, particularly given comps were little light on our expectations. 
Turning to new stores, for the last 8 quarters, our new store class has averaged 36 stores with sales per gross square foot over $700, translating the productivity levels of 80% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 16% comps, and more importantly, a 13% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Our EVA-based approach to site selection allows us to consider markets from Olathe, Kansas to New York City. While our expectations for sales productivity and operating expenses vary depending on the type of market and other factors, when balanced with the appropriate level of capital investment, a wide variety of markets can produce healthy returns for our shareholders. We are reaffirming our fiscal year targets. Comps have averaged 2.8% over the last 5 weeks, up from 2.4% for the last 9 weeks of Q2 excluding Easter. We're encouraged by this improvement and are continuing to lean into the changing marketplace, moving forward with our investments in value, marketing and technology. We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce pricing we have implemented in several markets. We added more markets in Q2 and expect this to expand as the year progresses. We continue to believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception. 
We're continuing our successful Value Matters brand advertising campaign. Beginning next week, this next round will focus on digital marketing, including online video, digital display ads and mobile and social ads. In Q2, our average weekly Instacart sales increased to $1.5 million. We continue to be the leading Apple Pay retailer with over 3.3 million transactions and surpassed 4 million followers on Twitter. Given those metrics, it is not surprising that in our brand tracking results, digital outperformed with our key demographics. We plan to follow-up this fall with an exciting new Values Matter campaign which will include national television and digital. 
Now turning to other news. At our investor conference in February, I said we would be making some pretty exciting announcements over the coming months, reflecting our ability to learn, grow and evolve. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of the new uniquely branded store concept unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace. Offering our industry-leading quality standards at value prices, this new format will feature modern streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection. We'll offer convenient, transparent and values-oriented experience geared towards millennial shoppers, while appealing to anyone looking for high-quality fresh food at great prices. We're building a team to focus exclusively on this new concept and are already negotiating leases. We plan to begin opening stores next year, and given the more standardized design and product assortment, we expect a fairly rapid expansion from there. Over the next several years, we have explored the idea of new format several times but never felt the time was right, particularly given our accelerated growth plans. That issue is now behind us as we have successfully increased our new store openings for 6 years. In addition, we now have a successful track record of opening some smaller format stores with a lower cost structure. 
The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness toward fresh, healthy foods by offering the highest quality, broader selection and best customer service, and we believe we can still triple the number of Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. At the same time, we have also seen an opportunity to leverage our long history of retail innovation and extend our reach in the marketplace beyond 1,200 stores. We want to underscore we see this as an and to our Whole Foods market brand and not an or. We believe the growth potential for this new and complementary brand to be as great as it is for our highly successful Whole Foods Market brand. This is all we're going to reveal today, but we look forward to sharing more detail about this exciting news venture some time before Labor Day. 
We'll now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

So we're well on our way for that. One thing to understand is that the market is exploding. I mean, it's incredible what's happening. I mean, if you -- one of the things that's fun to do at Whole Foods is we go back and we'd look at what our sales were per store 5 years ago, 8 years ago, 10 years ago. Our sales are so much higher, our sales per square foot is so much higher. And at the same time, we've been so successful that we've actually bred a lot more competition, and everybody's jumping kind of on the natural organic food bandwagon, and that's really, frankly, due to our success. So I don't see that there's a problem, but what I do think is that the Whole Foods Market brand is very targeted to a certain type of customer, certain type of shopper. We think the opportunity's a lot larger than that. And we think there are certain customers at the Whole Foods Market brand's attractive to, but there are other customers that is less attractive to. And we see a whole generation of young people coming up who are quite interested in natural organic foods. The millennial generation, they're idealistic, they're values-oriented, they're mission-driven. These all play to Whole Foods Market's strengths. They're also very value-conscious. So we think a streamlined, hip, cool technology-oriented store unlike any store anybody's ever seen before that has lower capital, lower cost, perhaps lower labor costs, and lower prices is going to be very, very attractive to that particular generation. So you can't envision it yet because it hasn't been created yet. We're creating yet. It will be new, it will be different, and it will be unlike any of the other stores you've seen out there.

So when we projected that we were going to do certain investments in price as it turns out because of the volume we move, we're able to actually negotiate a little bit better cost on that than we expected to. But we see, when we look out for the rest of the year, we are holding our guidance, we still see that our sequential decline in gross margin it will be what we have said at the beginning of the year would be. So we think we're going to continue with this. And if we've got a little better purchasing here, we'll do a little bit deeper investment going forward for the rest of the year."

We're investing more in marketing, and we're investing more in technology. At the same time, today, we've announced that we are coming out with a new format that we think will be specifically geared to address, an entire generation of people coming up that we think -- that line up well with Whole Foods. And this new concept will be less capital, more streamlined. It will have -- it will be value-oriented, and it will -- but it will still have Whole Foods quality standards. It will still have our mission and drive. We think it's going to be an exciting new concept. So these are the things that we're doing. Also in some ways the new competition is -- as much as the market's expanding, a lot of people get into it for the first time and they are going to temporarily gain some share because for convenience standpoint or they migrate certain customers over. But then they anniversary that. So the question is whether they will be able to comp their comps, 2, 3, 4, 5 years down the road. And so, I mean, one of the things that people don't fully understand is that even if Whole Foods Market just stopped, I mean our comps went flat, we were at 0, our sales per square foot, our return on invested capital, our whole store operating model is still, frankly, light years better than just anybody on the other food retailers out there that are at least public that we have their data on. So it's going to take a long time before people can catch up with us, but we're not going to sit still. We're going to continue to innovate. We're going to continue to differentiate ourselves. Our commitment to prepared foods, top the sales we do there. I mean, we're doing all that we can, but the reality is, there's more competition. Hey, I wish that wasn't true, but it's where we find ourselves. And we think we're doing, taking the necessary steps to compete well and continue to win in the marketplace."

I think we're clearly in a transition to a much more expanded marketplace. You see that's what you're referencing with foods and products available in many more places than historically. So I think just add a little to each of those, I mean the price thing for us is striving for relevance on price so we can continue our conversation on quality. So like we said before, we're not looking to race to the bottom. We're looking to be relevant on price so we can really, really have this conversation about quality. And to the second bucket with marketing specifically, it's about communicating the differences because we do not all sell the same stuff. And markets sometimes wants to drop it down to the lowest common denominator. And while there are some common products, much of our product niche is different. And I think the ability for us to communicate the differences in our product and the product offerings that we're bringing to our customers is where we're really trying to go to these efforts, as well as create a kind of a personal connection through the Affinity. Granted we've been a little slower perhaps than we should have been in terms of getting those things in place, but we are through the use of technology, building out and extending ourself where our customers are, whether it's through Instacart or home delivery, which we're doing more than any other grocery store in America now, and we're really just getting started, whether it's through Affinity, which builds a personal connection to customers who allow to customize their relationship with us. Whether it's through the ease of Apple Pay that -- which will soon go to the next thing you know about, which will gives customers the easier, the most seamless experience. It's whether it's our improving app which ultimately these things can be put together to give customers more integrated experience with Whole Foods digitally. All those things are in the works. And I wish that we were doing them faster, but we're doing them as fast as we can do as we replace all of our foundational systems and technology to get there. Ultimately, where we're going is to create this fuller, richer experience, physically and digitally, for our customers. And as John says, we're taking these steps and we're doing it at a time when the marketplace is going through a huge transition. But make no mistake about it, we still have a tremendous amount of strength in this company."

It's an experience when you go into the store. And then say that's kind of the Whole Foods Market brand trajectory. And then you have this new format that is, the stores are not as large, they're more streamlined, they're tech-savvy, there's less capital being invested in it, they're very convenient for people and they're very value-focused with a tailored product mix. So maybe if you go into a big Whole Foods Market, maybe you've got a thousand different kinds of wine from a price point all the way from $2.99 to a few hundred dollars. But maybe in this -- our new concept store, you'll have a more tailored mix of wine. You won't have -- it will just be good quality value wines and they won't have the same upward trajectory. So is it something that's going to harm Whole Foods Market? We don't see it that way. We see it as complementary. We'll see that our loyalty card program will include both brands, and we see people crossing over in it. And -- but one of the things that I think I've learned from other businesses is you have to be willing to evolve with the marketplace. You have to be willing to do what it takes to serve your customers better, and you can not do that because it might possibly take sales from your existing flagship brand. You've got to be willing to serve your customers where you find them. That will cause the Whole Foods Market flagship brand to evolve as we roll out our next brand, just like it's evolving right now with the competition that we're facing. So we see that this is a huge opportunity that the natural organic foods revolution is sweeping America. We intend to be the -- continue to be the leader in this category for the rest of the century. And so we're evolving with the marketplace. We're going to create a new -- we are creating a new format, a new concept that's not been seen, that no one else has done. It's going to be unique and we think it's going to be very exciting to the customer base, and we'll see what happens. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen until you start doing it."

There will very tech-savvy stores, and they'll be very exciting to the -- until we think to the millennial generation of about 90 million people. So we think these concepts are very complementary to each other. There will be some overlap, and -- but in the best of all worlds for Whole Foods, people will shop both stores. They'll come in and enjoy the big exciting Whole Foods Market and they'll do fill-in shops at the new concept and the stores will intermix with each other in a very unique way. And we'll have a larger product mix at the bigger flagship Whole Foods Market stores than we will in the new format. We'll have a more tailored mix there. So that's what's -- we really can't say too much more than that. There'll be a bigger reveal later on as we get in -- this summer. So it's not that far away. You have to wait, like, a few months, and we'll give you more."

In Q2, our sales increased 10% to $3.6 billion driven by comps of 3.6% and square footage growth of 11%. We opened 11 new stores, including 3 relocations and 3 former Dominick's locations. There are many moving",1043,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, our sales increased 10% to $3.6 billion driven by comps of 3.6% and square footage growth of 11%. We opened 11 new stores, including 3 relocations and 3 former Dominick's locations. There are many moving pieces so we can't definitively -- say definitively what caused the moderation in comps during the quarter. We do know that we are not immune to the larger macro environment, and the exploding demand for natural and organic products has resulted in increased competition from many different channels. In addition, severe weather and cannibalization had a larger impact in Q2 than in Q1. We're on track to report our sixth consecutive year of record new store openings. A high percentage of our accelerated growth is in existing markets, which is driving market share gains but also producing a drag on comps from higher cannibalization in some cases. We saw this in Austin and Boston last year, and we're seeing it in Chicago and Florida right now. Keep in mind that our average weekly sales per store are over $720,000. So even when a store gets hit, it is still highly profitable and continues to produce strong returns on invested capital. The store might report slower growth per year, but after anniversary-ing the new store opening, it regains momentum quickly. Gross margin, excluding the nonroutine supplier credit, declined 12 basis points due primarily to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. While we do our best to estimate the impact of our value efforts, it is more art than science and customer reactions can vary from our predictions. In addition, strong execution on the buy side helped offset our investments to a greater degree than we had forecast. For the fiscal year, we still expect a greater year-over-year decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, than we saw last year. SG&A improved 29 basis points due to leverage in salaries and benefits. We're pleased with our continued expense disciplines, particularly given comps were little light on our expectations. 
Turning to new stores, for the last 8 quarters, our new store class has averaged 36 stores with sales per gross square foot over $700, translating the productivity levels of 80% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 16% comps, and more importantly, a 13% return on invested capital, well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Our EVA-based approach to site selection allows us to consider markets from Olathe, Kansas to New York City. While our expectations for sales productivity and operating expenses vary, depending on the type of market and other factors, when balanced with the appropriate level of capital investment, a wide variety of markets can produce healthy returns for our shareholders. We are reaffirming our fiscal year targets. Comps have averaged 2.8% over the last 5 weeks, up from 2.4% for the last 9 weeks of Q2 excluding Easter. We're encouraged by this improvement and are continuing to lean into the changing marketplace, moving forward with our investments in value, marketing and technology. We continue to see unit lift from the lower produce pricing we have implemented in several markets. We added more markets in Q2 and expect this to expand as the year progresses. We continue to believe more competitive produce pricing will greatly benefit our overall value perception. 
We're continuing our successful Value Matters brand advertising campaign. Beginning next week, this next round will focus on digital marketing, including online video, digital display ads and mobile and social ads. In Q2, our average weekly Instacart sales increased to $1.5 million. We continue to be the leading Apple Pay retailer with over 3.3 million transactions and surpassed 4 million followers on Twitter. Given those metrics, it is not surprising that in our brand tracking results, digital outperformed with our key demographics. We plan to follow-up this fall with an exciting new Values Matter campaign, which will include national television and digital. 
Now turning to other news. At our investor conference in February, I said we would be making some pretty exciting announcements over the coming months, reflecting our ability to learn, grow and evolve. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of the new uniquely branded store concept unlike anything that currently exists in the marketplace. Offering our industry-leading quality standards at value prices, this new format will feature modern streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection. We'll offer convenient, transparent and values-oriented experience geared towards millennial shoppers while appealing to anyone looking for high-quality fresh food at great prices. We're building a team to focus exclusively on this new concept and are already negotiating leases. We plan to begin opening stores next year, and given the more standardized design and product assortment, we expect a fairly rapid expansion from there. Over the next several years, we have explored the idea of new format several times but never felt the time was right, particularly given our accelerated growth plans. That issue is now behind us as we have successfully increased our new store openings for 6 years. In addition, we now have a successful track record of opening some smaller format stores with a lower cost structure. 
The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness toward fresh, healthy foods by offering the highest quality, broader selection and best customer service, and we believe we can still triple the number of Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. At the same time, we have also seen an opportunity to leverage our long history of retail innovation and extend our reach in the marketplace beyond 1,200 stores. We want to underscore we see this as an and to our Whole Foods market brand and not an or. We believe the growth potential for this new and complementary brand to be as great as it is for our highly successful Whole Foods Market brand. This is all we're going to reveal today, but we look forward to sharing more detail about this exciting new adventure some time before Labor Day. 
We'll now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

So we're well on our way for that. One thing to understand is that the market is exploding. I mean, it's incredible what's happening. I mean, if you -- one of the things that's fun to do at Whole Foods is we go back and we'd look at what our sales were per store 5 years ago, 8 years ago, 10 years ago. Our sales are so much higher, our sales per square foot is so much higher. And at the same time, we've been so successful that we've actually bred a lot more competition, and everybody's jumping kind of on the natural organic food bandwagon, and that's really, frankly, due to our success. So I don't see that there's a problem, but what I do think is that the Whole Foods Market brand is very targeted to a certain type of customer, certain type of shopper. We think the opportunity's a lot larger than that. And we think there are certain customers at the Whole Foods Market brand's attractive to, but there are other customers that is less attractive to. And we see a whole generation of young people coming up who are quite interested in natural organic foods. The millennial generation, they're idealistic, they're values-oriented, they're mission-driven. These all play to Whole Foods Market's strengths. They're also very value-conscious. So we think a streamlined, hip, cool technology-oriented store unlike any store anybody's ever seen before that has lower capital, lower cost, perhaps lower labor costs, and lower prices is going to be very, very attractive to that particular generation.

And as we open 39, 38, 39, 40 new stores next year, we're continuing down that path. And it just looks that this new format that we're developing, that we're going to tell you more about in a few months is going to be able to access many more broader markets and communities that perhaps we couldn't serve with our flagship brand. And so you think about it, if everybody knows this marketplace for fresh, healthy foods is getting larger by the day, with the different announcements that people are making. And this new concept that we're developing will allow us to access and participate and contribute and lead in many more markets than -- and this opens up a whole lot of new range of opportunity for all of our stakeholders.

We are able to negotiate stronger value discounts with some of our suppliers especially in the grocery and produce areas than we originally thought. So when we projected that we were going to do certain investments in price as it turns out because of the volume we moved, we're able to actually negotiate a little bit better cost on that than we expected to. But we see, when we look out for the rest of the year, we are holding our guidance, we still see that our sequential decline in gross margin, it will be what we have said at the beginning of the year would be.

We're investing more in marketing, and we're investing more in technology. At the same time, today, we've announced that we are coming out with a new format that we think will be specifically geared to address an entire generation of people coming up that we think -- that line up well with Whole Foods. And this new concept will be less capital, more streamlined. It will have -- it will be value-oriented, and it will -- but it will still have Whole Foods quality standards. It will still have our mission and drive. We think it's going to be an exciting new concept. So these are the things that we're doing. Also in some ways the new competition is -- as much as the market's expanding, a lot of people get into it for the first time and they are going to temporarily gain some share because for convenience standpoint or they migrate certain customers over. But then they anniversary that. So the question is whether they will be able to comp their comps, 2, 3, 4, 5 years down the road. And so, I mean, one of the things that people don't fully understand is that even if Whole Foods Market just stopped, I mean our comps went flat, we were at 0, our sales per square foot, our return on invested capital, our whole store operating model is still, frankly, light years better than just anybody on the other food retailers out there that are at least public that we have their data on. So it's going to take a long time before people can catch up with us, but we're not going to sit still. We're going to continue to innovate. We're going to continue to differentiate ourselves. Our commitment to prepared foods, top the sales we do there. I mean, we're doing all that we can, but the reality is, there's more competition. Hey, I wish that wasn't true, but it's where we find ourselves. And we think we're doing, taking the necessary steps to compete well and continue to win in the marketplace."

I think we're clearly in a transition to a much more expanded marketplace. You see that's what you're referencing with foods and products available in many more places than historically. So I think just add a little to each of those, I mean the price thing for us is striving for relevance on price so we can continue our conversation on quality. So like we said before, we're not looking to race to the bottom. We're looking to be relevant on price so we can really, really have this conversation about quality. And to the second bucket with marketing specifically, it's about communicating the differences because we do not all sell the same stuff. And markets sometimes wants to drop it down to the lowest common denominator. And while there are some common products, much of our product niche is different. And I think the ability for us to communicate the differences in our product and the product offerings that we're bringing to our customers is where we're really trying to go to these efforts, as well as create a kind of a personal connection through the Affinity. Granted we've been a little slower perhaps than we should have been in terms of getting those things in place, but we are, through the use of technology, building out and extending ourself where our customers are, whether it's through Instacart or home delivery, which we're doing more than any other grocery store in America now, and we're really just getting started, whether it's through Affinity, which builds a personal connection to customers who allow to customize their relationship with us. Whether it's through the ease of Apple Pay that -- which will soon go to the next thing you know about, which will gives customers the easier, the most seamless experience. It's whether it's our improving app which ultimately these things can be put together to give customers more integrated experience with Whole Foods digitally. All those things are in the works. And I wish that we were doing them faster, but we're doing them as fast as we can do as we replace all of our foundational systems and technology to get there. Ultimately, where we're going is to create this fuller, richer experience, physically and digitally, for our customers. And as John says, we're taking these steps and we're doing it at a time when the marketplace is going through a huge transition. But make no mistake about it, we still have a tremendous amount of strength in this company."

So I think that we weren't acknowledging that as this thing broadens and widens but the thing is the opportunity keeps getting so much bigger, here's another way for us to do that, that's going to access other communities and other folks that we could not access particularly with our Whole Foods flagship brand. So no one's saying that the -- the size of opportunities is just enormous. I think we're all seeing that unfold daily. But I think we've already kind of laid out the trajectory that we see that the margins will, in fact, go down year-over-year for the next several years. You want to add to that, John?"

It's an experience when you go into the store. And then say that's kind of the Whole Foods Market brand trajectory. And then you have this new format that is, the stores are not as large, they're more streamlined, they're tech-savvy, there's less capital being invested in it, they're very convenient for people and they're very value-focused with a tailored product mix. So maybe if you go into a big Whole Foods Market, maybe you've got a thousand different kinds of wine from a price point all the way from $2.99 to a few hundred dollars. But maybe in this -- our new concept store, you'll have a more tailored mix of wine. You won't have -- it will just be good quality value wines and they won't have the same upward trajectory. So is it something that's going to harm Whole Foods Market? We don't see it that way. We see it as complementary. We'll see that our loyalty card program will include both brands, and we see people crossing over in it. And -- but one of the things that I think I've learned from other businesses is you have to be willing to evolve with the marketplace. You have to be willing to do what it takes to serve your customers better, and you can't not do that because it might possibly take sales from your existing flagship brand. You've got to be willing to serve your customers where you find them. That will cause the Whole Foods Market flagship brand to evolve as we roll out our next brand, just like it's evolving right now with the competition that we're facing. So we see that this is a huge opportunity that the natural organic foods revolution is sweeping America. We intend to be the -- continue to be the leader in this category for the rest of the century. And so we're evolving with the marketplace. We're going to create a new -- we are creating a new format, a new concept that's not been seen, that no one else has done. It's going to be unique and we think it's going to be very exciting to the customer base, and we'll see what happens. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen until you start doing it."

But you're obviously moving on your Whole Foods fleet to a larger format. And I guess, first question is, are you -- is the larger increase in store size basically to accommodate mostly the wine bars and the beer halls? And then can you help me just to understand how that impacts ROIC going forward, if it's in fact it is wine bar and beer halls?"

It's an experience that -- food is a very sensual, exciting thing for people. We want these stores to be incredibly exciting. So the trend line for Whole Foods Market will probably be towards larger stores. They're very experientially oriented with a very differentiated product mix for the customer base. And then we'll have our new format that will be -- the stores will be more streamlined. It won't be as large. It will be value-oriented. There will be a more tailored product mix. There will very tech-savvy stores, and they'll be very exciting to the -- to, we think, to the millennial generation of about 90 million people. So we think these concepts are very complementary to each other. There will be some overlap, and -- but in the best of all worlds for Whole Foods, people will shop both stores. They'll come in and enjoy the big, exciting Whole Foods Market and they'll do fill-in shops at the new concept and the stores will intermix with each other in a very unique way. And we'll have a larger product mix at the bigger flagship Whole Foods Market stores than we will in the new format. We'll have a more tailored mix there. So that's what's -- we really can't say too much more than that. There'll be a bigger reveal later on as we get in -- this summer. So it's not that far away. You have to wait, like, a few months, and we'll give you more."

Year-over-year, our quarterly sales grew $255 million to a record $3.6 billion. We opened 8 new stores and increasing our operating square footage 11% to $16 million and expanding our reach to 422 stores across 41 states and 3 countries. On an adjusted basis, comparable store sales increased 2.2% for the quarter, moderating 90 basis points from Q2. We estimate that the negative impact from cannibalization was 30 basis points greater in Q3 than in Q2. Comps improved 20 basis points from the last 9 weeks of Q2 to the first 10 weeks of Q3, driven primarily by a 70 basis point improvement in traffic, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in basket size. We attribute the moderation in basket size primarily due to our value efforts and to cost deflation in few key product categories, including produce. 
Comps dropped sharply in week 11 and, after our New York City Weights and Measures audit received national media attention and averaged just 0.4% for the last 2 weeks of the quarter. We have seen a slight improvement in trends fourth quarter to date. However, comps are still well below our 2.5% average for the 19 weeks prior to the negative publicity. We believe increasing headwinds are also a factor as sales began to stabilize in the last few weeks of Q3 last year. 
I want to take a moment to address the New York City Weights and Measures Audit. As well as New York City Department of Consumer Affairs came to us, we worked to understand and address the issues to prevent them from happening again. I want to emphasize these were not systematic but rather caused by inadvertent human error. The audit included errors that were both favorable to customers as well. These are weights and measures issues that can be found in any supermarket. Clear and transparent pricing is integral to how we operate. We have taken immediate steps to address these issues including improving our training regarding in-store packing, weighing and labeling processes, and expanding our third quarter auditing process company-wide. We built our business on the core value of satisfying and delighting our customers. It is what our customers have grown to love and expect from us and approach to pricing transparency is no different. If the price is not accurate and not priced in the customer's favor, then that item is free to the customer, no charge, no question. 
Turning back to our results, gross margin x LIFO decreased 66 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. Our results reflect our more aggressive efforts to improve our price relevancy as well as higher shrink in the last 2 weeks of the quarter given that purchases were planned for a higher-level of sales heading into the 4th of July holiday. SG&A increased 24 basis points to 28.4% of sales against a record low in the prior year, due primarily to higher depreciation as a percentage of sales. Results included 21 basis points in expense related to the implementation of California's new paid and sick leave law. Despite lower-than-expected sales, we maintain our labor expense disciplines and leverage wages. 
Our new store class for the last 8 quarters has averaged 38 stores, with sales per gross square foot of approximately $700, translating to productivity levels of 78% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 15% comps and most importantly, a 13% return on invested capital well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered 9.7% EBITDA margin, $287 million of operating cash flow and a 15% return on invested capital. Year-to-date, we have produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $990, over $1 billion in EBITDA and $1 billion in cash flow from operation. A strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we have self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning over $325 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness towards fresh healthy foods. With 424 stores totaling more than 16 million square feet today, we expect the cost of 500 store mark in fiscal year 2017 and over the longer term continue to seek potential for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. As announced last quarter, we are introducing a second format, 365 By Whole Foods Market, which we believe expands our growth opportunity beyond the 1,200 stores. While more streamlined than a typical Whole Foods Market store, our 365 store will be guided by the same industry-leading quality standards. As a second growth vehicle, 365 will be very complementary to our Whole Foods Market brand, allowing us to address the value quality proposition in a new while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 365 President Jeff Turner is building a top-notch team and has hit the ground running. We are excited today to announce leases for the 5 365 stores in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Portland, Houston and Belleveu, Washington. These are all A+ real estate sites which meet our required EVA hurdle return. We are currently targeting up to 5 365 store openings in the second half of next calendar year, with the expectation of doubling that number of openings for calendar 2017. With opportunities new and existing as well as urban and suburban markets, most of are our first stores are expected to be in the existing markets to better leverage our existing team member base and infrastructure. Our first 365 By Whole Foods Market store is scheduled to open in Silverlake area of Los Angeles, where we converted a lease and development from Whole Foods Market to 365. Los Angeles is the perfect dense urban market, where customers already love our quality standards and transparency to introduce our latest evolution focused on quality food and value in a convenient format. We're excited to reveal more as things develop. 
Turning now to our outlook for Q4, we have opened 2 new stores and expect to open 8 additional stores, including 1 relocation. If current comp trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 7% and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.35. This outlook reflects current trends, as well as some headwinds from moderating inflation, increased cannibalization and our own value efforts. For the fiscal year, this translates to sales growth of approximately 9% with comps in the low-single digits and square footage up 10%. We continue to expect EBITDA margin of approximately 9% and ROIC greater than 14%. For the next fiscal year, we are forecasting ending square footage growth of approximately 9% or 7.5% growth on a weighted square footage basis, reflecting a back-end-loaded store opening schedule. We will provide additional details in our outlook next quarter. 
In summary, in this retail marketplace, which is more dynamic and competitive than ever, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to position ourself for the long-term. While we acknowledge it is taking longer than we would have hoped, we believe continue to invest in our price relevancy, our marketing and our technologies the right strategy to regain sales momentum. We are encouraged by the unit lift we have seen from our price investments and will continue to expand on that strategy. We are committed to investing in marketing to support our value efforts as well as our brand and our excited by our new brand campaign this fall. Year-to-date, we have made progress in our Digital and technology efforts to better serve our customers. We are live with both work date for all of our team members, have launched our new iOS and Android mobile ads, refreshed our web experience and are testing and evolving our Affinity program. While still in the early stages, we have also piloted our new 1 POS and kiosk ordering for food menus and rolling out a labor scheduling to our customers service teams. We will continue to build out and enhance these efforts next year while also beginning to mobilize our new product platform which will bring us many exciting capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, sales space planning and price optimization. We remain focused on innovating optimization. We remain focused on enervating and evolve optimization. We remain focused on innovating and evolving to best serve our customers diverse purchasing preferences in this rapidly changing marketplace, from the unique experience of our Whole Foods Market stores to the growing online channel for home delivery to the exciting launch of our 365 and Whole Foods Market stores, we are leaning in to extend our reach into new as well as existing customers. 
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 445 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. So please if you can, limit yourself to one question at a time so everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

And as I said earlier, we've been very happy with the unit lift there. The other area we've seen a little bit of deflation is in seafood. Some of the higher volume items that we sell like wild salmon at this time of the year is cheaper than last year, shrimp prices have come down and we also are surely more of our value frozen program. I know that I've seen some other retailers talk about the deflation in dairy, and while conventional dairy has come down a little bit, organic dairy, which we sell a lot of, is still seeing inflationary pressures. So in cases like that, we're probably dealing more the issue of not trying not to pass along some of the price increases that we've been seeing to keep those prices reasonable. We're also seeing a little bit of inflation in a few key areas like nuts like almonds and pistachios. Definitely they're seeing a lot of inflation because of the droughts in California.

And what this go down in comps doesn't real estate is so that it requires us to reformulate or recalculate when we look at new stores with a lower comp base, that means it's a tougher real estate hurdle. So we just had a real estate meeting in Tuesday and all the sites we were looking at on Tuesday, which was about 10 sites, they all had to have lower comp expectations. And that made achieving our 5-year EVA hurdle more difficult for them. And just a couple of them washed out. That would have passed intrigue issue as to meetings with more aggressive comp assumptions. So we've already adjusted, you might say, to a lower comp basis and that makes it difficult -- more difficult for locations to hit the ROICs and EVAs that we require. I suppose the good news is that even with the lower comps, we still have a lot of sites that are going to be extremely profitable for us and profitable for the shareholders. So I think the key takeaway there is we're not going to slow down our growth unless we can't find locations that are going to produce 5-year EVAs on a present value basis that will give us the returns on invested capital that we're looking for. As long as we can, that's how we're going to continue to manage the business. And so, anyway, that's our answer."

Year-over-year, our quarterly sales grew $255 million to a record $3.6 billion. We opened 8 new stores and increasing our operating square footage 11% to $16 million and expanding our reach to 422 stores across 41 states and 3 countries. On an adjusted basis, comparable store sales increased 2.2% for the quarter, moderating 90 basis points from Q2. We estimate that the negative impact from cannibalization was 30 basis points greater in Q3 than in Q2. Comps improved 20 basis points from the last 9 weeks of Q2 to the first 10 weeks of Q3, driven primarily by a 70 basis point improvement in traffic, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in basket size. We attribute the moderation in basket size primarily due to our value efforts and to cost deflation in few key product categories, including produce. 
Comps dropped sharply in week 11, and after our New York City weights and measures audit received national media attention, and averaged just 0.4% for the last 2 weeks of the quarter. We have seen a slight improvement in trends fourth quarter to date. However, comps are still well below our 2.5% average for the 19 weeks prior to the negative publicity. We believe increasing headwinds are also a factor as sales began to stabilize in the last few weeks of Q3 last year. 
I want to take a moment to address the New York City weights and measures audit. As soon as the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs came to us, we worked to understand and address the issues to prevent them from happening again. I want to emphasize these were not systematic, but rather caused by inadvertent human error. The audit included errors that were favorable to customers as well. These are weights and measures issues that can be found in any supermarket. 
Clear and transparent pricing is integral to how we operate. We have taken immediate steps to address these issues including improving our training regarding in-store packing, weighing and labeling processes, and expanding our third-party auditing process company-wide. We built our business on the core value of satisfying and delighting our customers. It is what our customers have grown to love and expect from us and our approach to pricing transparency is no different. If a price is not accurate and not priced in the customer's favor, then that item is free to the customer, no charge, no question. 
Turning back to our results, gross margin, x LIFO, decreased 66 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. Our results reflect our more aggressive efforts to improve our price relevancy as well as higher shrink in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, given that purchases were planned for a higher level of sales heading into the 4th of July holiday. SG&A increased 24 basis points to 28.4% of sales against a record low in the prior year, due primarily to higher depreciation as a percentage of sales. Results included 21 basis points in expense related to the implementation of California's new paid sick leave law. Despite lower-than-expected sales, we maintained our labor expense disciplines and leveraged wages. 
Our new store class for the last 8 quarters has averaged 38 stores, with sales per gross square foot of approximately $700, translating to productivity levels of 78% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 15% comps and most importantly, a 13% return on invested capital well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered 9.7% EBITDA margin, $287 million of operating cash flow and a 15% return on invested capital. Year-to-date, we have produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $990, over $1 billion in EBITDA and $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we have self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning over $325 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness towards fresh, healthy foods. With 424 stores totaling more than 16 million square feet today, we expect to cross the 500-store mark in fiscal year 2017, and over the longer term, continue to seek potential for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. 
As announced last quarter, we are introducing a second format, 365 by Whole Foods Market, which we believe expands our growth opportunity beyond the 1,200 stores. While more streamlined than a typical Whole Foods Market store, our 365 stores will be guided by the same industry-leading quality standards. As a second growth vehicle, 365 will be very complementary to our Whole Foods Market brand, allowing us to address the value-quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 365 President Jeff Turnas is building a top-notch team and has hit the ground running. We are excited today to announce leases for the 5 365 stores in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Portland, Houston and Bellevue, Washington. These are all A+ real estate sites which meet our required EVA-hurdle return. We are currently targeting up to 5 365 store openings in the second half of next calendar year, with the expectation of doubling that number of openings in calendar 2017. With opportunities in new and existing as well as urban and suburban markets, most of our first stores are expected to be in the existing markets to better leverage our existing team member base and infrastructure. Our first 365 by Whole Foods Market store is scheduled to open in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where we converted a lease and development from Whole Foods Market to 365. Los Angeles is the perfect dense urban market, where customers already love our quality standards and transparency to introduce our latest evolution focused on quality food and value in a convenient format. We're excited to reveal more as things develop. 
Turning now to our outlook for Q4, we have opened 2 new stores and expect to open 8 additional stores, including 1 relocation. If current comp trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 7% and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.35. This outlook reflects current trends, as well as some headwinds from moderating inflation, increased cannibalization and our own value efforts. 
For the fiscal year, this translates to sales growth of approximately 9%, with comps in the low-single digits and square footage up 10%. We continue to expect EBITDA margin of approximately 9% and ROIC greater than 14%. For the next fiscal year, we are forecasting ending square footage growth of approximately 9% or 7.5% growth on a weighted square footage basis, reflecting a back-end-loaded store-opening schedule. We will provide additional details in our outlook next quarter. 
In summary, in this retail marketplace, which is more dynamic and competitive than ever, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to position ourself for the long-term. While we acknowledge it is taking longer than we would have hoped, we believe we continue to invest in our price relevancy, our marketing and our technologies the right strategy to regain sales momentum. We are encouraged by the unit lift we have seen from our price investments and will continue to expand on that strategy. We are committed to investing in marketing to support our value efforts as well as our brand and are excited by our new brand campaign this fall. 
Year-to-date, we have made progress in our digital and technology efforts to better serve our customers. We are live with both Workday for all of our team members, have launched our new iOS and Android mobile apps, refreshed our web experience and are testing and evolving our Affinity program. While still in the early stages, we have also piloted our new OnePOS and kiosk ordering for food menus and are rolling out labor scheduling to our customer service teams. We will continue to build out and enhance these efforts next year while also beginning to mobilize our new product platform, which will bring us many new exciting capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, space planning and price optimization. 
We remain focused on innovating and evolving to best serve our customers' diverse purchasing preferences in this rapidly changing marketplace. From the unique experience of our Whole Foods Market stores, to the growing online channel for home delivery, to the exciting launch of our 365 by Whole Foods Market stores, we are leaning in to extend our reach to new as well as existing customers. 
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

I mean, will there be some cannibalization of Whole Foods? I mean, probably, but we don't know exactly how much until we do. It will probably be less than we open up an actual branded Whole Foods Market store because it's going to appeal to a little bit different customer, we think. So it is an experiment. We do have 5 stores committed. We have several other stores we are negotiating leases on.

We've definitely been seeing some deflation in produce and a lot of it is our pricing investments because we're not seeing deflation, for instance, in organic produce, there's a lot of demand there, and there's still upward pressure on prices. And we sell a lot such a high percentage of organic produce that, that affects us. But our pricing initiatives in produce have definitely cost us, overall, to see a lowering of prices. And as I said earlier, we've been very happy with the unit lift there. The other area we've seen a little bit of deflation is in seafood. Some of the higher volume items that we sell like wild salmon at this time of the year is cheaper than last year. Shrimp prices have come down, and we also are selling more of our value frozen program. I know that I've seen some other retailers talk about a deflation in dairy, and while conventional dairy has come down a little bit, organic dairy, which we sell a lot of, is still seeing inflationary pressures. So in cases like that, we're probably dealing more with an issue of not trying not to pass along some of the price increases that we've been seeing to keep those prices reasonable. We're also seeing a little bit of inflation in a few key areas like nuts like almonds and pistachios. They've definitely been seeing a lot of inflation because of the droughts in California. And we sell a lot of olive oil and that's -- there was a big crop failure in Italy this year, so we're seeing a little there. So we're really seeing a little bit going both ways in inflation."

And what the slowdown in comps does in real estate is that it requires us to reformulate or recalculate when we look at new stores with a lower comp base, that means it's a tougher real estate hurdle. So we just had a real estate meeting on Tuesday, and all the sites we were looking at on Tuesday, which was about 10 sites, they all had to have lower comp expectations. And that made achieving our 5-year EVA hurdle more difficult for them. And a couple of them washed out. That would have passed in previous real estate meetings with more aggressive comp assumptions. So we've already adjusted, you might say, to a lower comp basis and that makes it -- more difficult for locations to hit the ROICs and EVAs that we require. I suppose the good news is that even with the lower comps, we still have a lot of sites that are going to be extremely profitable for us and profitable for the shareholders. So I think the key takeaway there is that we're not going to slow down our growth unless we can't find locations that are going to produce 5-year EVAs on a present value basis and give us the returns on invested capital that we're looking for. As long as we can, that's how we're going to continue to manage the business. And so anyway, that's our answer."

My interpretation of reading that is they're basically trying to preempt states like Vermont and other states from creating their own GMO laws, so they're trying to prevent the states from doing that. It will not affect a private certification or Whole Foods' own efforts for transparency."

Year-over-year, our quarterly sales grew $255 million to a record $3.6 billion. We opened 8 new stores, increasing our operating square footage 11% to $16 million and expanding our reach to 422 stores across 41 states and 3 countries. On an adjusted basis, comparable store sales increased 2.2% for the quarter, moderating 90 basis points from Q2. We estimate that the negative impact from cannibalization was 30 basis points greater in Q3 than in Q2. Comps improved 20 basis points from the last 9 weeks of Q2 to the first 10 weeks of Q3, driven primarily by a 70 basis point improvement in traffic, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in basket size. We attribute the moderation in basket size primarily due to our value efforts and to cost deflation in few key product categories, including produce. 
Comps dropped sharply in week 11, and after our New York City weights and measures audit received national media attention, and averaged just 0.4% for the last 2 weeks of the quarter. We have seen a slight improvement in trends fourth quarter to date. However, comps are still well below our 2.5% average for the 19 weeks prior to the negative publicity. We believe increasing headwinds are also a factor as sales began to stabilize in the last few weeks of Q3 last year. 
I want to take a moment to address the New York City weights and measures audit. As soon as the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs came to us, we worked to understand and address the issues to prevent them from happening again. I want to emphasize these were not systematic, but rather caused by inadvertent human error. The audit included errors that were favorable to customers as well. These are weights and measures issues that can be found in any supermarket. 
Clear and transparent pricing is integral to how we operate. We have taken immediate steps to address these issues including improving our training regarding in-store packing, weighing and labeling processes, and expanding our third-party auditing process company-wide. We built our business on the core value of satisfying and delighting our customers. It is what our customers have grown to love and expect from us and our approach to pricing transparency is no different. If a price is not accurate and not priced in the customer's favor, then that item is free to the customer, no charge, no question. 
Turning back to our results, gross margin, x LIFO, decreased 66 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. Our results reflect our more aggressive efforts to improve our price relevancy as well as higher shrink in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, given that purchases were planned for a higher level of sales heading into the 4th of July holiday. SG&A increased 24 basis points to 28.4% of sales against a record low in the prior year, due primarily to higher depreciation as a percentage of sales. Results included 21 basis points in expense related to the implementation of California's new paid sick leave law. Despite lower-than-expected sales, we maintained our labor expense disciplines and leveraged wages. 
Our new store class for the last 8 quarters has averaged 38 stores, with sales per gross square foot of approximately $700, translating to productivity levels of 78% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 15% comps and most importantly, a 13% return on invested capital well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered 9.7% EBITDA margin, $287 million of operating cash flow and a 15% return on invested capital. Year-to-date, we have produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $990, over $1 billion in EBITDA and $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we have self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning over $325 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness towards fresh, healthy foods. With 424 stores totaling more than 16 million square feet today, we expect to cross the 500-store mark in fiscal year 2017, and over the longer term, continue to see potential for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. 
As announced last quarter, we are introducing a second format, 365 by Whole Foods Market, which we believe expands our growth opportunity beyond the 1,200 stores. While more streamlined than a typical Whole Foods Market store, our 365 stores will be guided by the same industry-leading quality standards. As a second growth vehicle, 365 will be very complementary to our Whole Foods Market brand, allowing us to address the value-quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 365 President Jeff Turnas is building a top-notch team and has hit the ground running. We are excited today to announce leases for the 5 365 stores in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Portland, Houston and Bellevue, Washington. These are all A+ real estate sites which meet our required EVA-hurdle return. We are currently targeting up to 5 365 store openings in the second half of next calendar year, with the expectation of doubling that number of openings in calendar 2017. With opportunities in new and existing as well as urban and suburban markets, most of our first stores are expected to be in the existing markets to better leverage our existing team member base and infrastructure. Our first 365 by Whole Foods Market store is scheduled to open in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where we converted a lease and development from Whole Foods Market to 365. Los Angeles is the perfect dense urban market, where customers already love our quality standards and transparency to introduce our latest evolution focused on quality food and value in a convenient format. We're excited to reveal more as things develop. 
Turning now to our outlook for Q4, we have opened 2 new stores and expect to open 8 additional stores, including 1 relocation. If current comp trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 7% and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.35. This outlook reflects current trends, as well as some headwinds from moderating inflation, increased cannibalization and our own value efforts. 
For the fiscal year, this translates to sales growth of approximately 9%, with comps in the low-single digits and square footage up 10%. We continue to expect EBITDA margin of approximately 9% and ROIC greater than 14%. For the next fiscal year, we are forecasting ending square footage growth of approximately 9% or 7.5% growth on a weighted square footage basis, reflecting a back-end-loaded store-opening schedule. We will provide additional details in our outlook next quarter. 
In summary, in this retail marketplace, which is more dynamic and competitive than ever, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to position ourself for the long-term. While we acknowledge it is taking longer than we would have hoped, we believe we continue to invest in our price relevancy, our marketing and our technologies the right strategy to regain sales momentum. We are encouraged by the unit lift we have seen from our price investments and will continue to expand on that strategy. We are committed to investing in marketing to support our value efforts as well as our brand and are excited by our new brand campaign this fall. 
Year-to-date, we have made progress in our digital and technology efforts to better serve our customers. We are live with both Workday for all of our team members, have launched our new iOS and Android mobile apps, refreshed our web experience and are testing and evolving our Affinity program. While still in the early stages, we have also piloted our new OnePOS and kiosk ordering for food menus and are rolling out labor scheduling to our customer service teams. We will continue to build out and enhance these efforts next year while also beginning to mobilize our new product platform, which will bring us many new exciting capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, space planning and price optimization. 
We remain focused on innovating and evolving to best serve our customers' diverse purchasing preferences in this rapidly changing marketplace. From the unique experience of our Whole Foods Market stores, to the growing online channel for home delivery, to the exciting launch of our 365 by Whole Foods Market stores, we are leaning in to extend our reach to new as well as existing customers. 
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

We've definitely been seeing some deflation in produce and a lot of it is our pricing investments because we're not seeing deflation, for instance, in organic produce, there's a lot of demand there, and there's still upward pressure on prices. And we sell a lot such a high percentage of organic produce that, that affects us. But our pricing initiatives in produce have definitely caused us, overall, to see a lowering of prices. And as I said earlier, we've been very happy with the unit lift there. The other area we've seen a little bit of deflation is in seafood. Some of the higher volume items that we sell like wild salmon at this time of the year is cheaper than last year. Shrimp prices have come down, and we also are selling more of our value frozen program. I know that I've seen some other retailers talk about a deflation in dairy, and while conventional dairy has come down a little bit, organic dairy, which we sell a lot of, is still seeing inflationary pressures. So in cases like that, we're probably dealing more with an issue of not trying not to pass along some of the price increases that we've been seeing to keep those prices reasonable. We're also seeing a little bit of inflation in a few key areas like nuts like almonds and pistachios. They've definitely been seeing a lot of inflation because of the droughts in California.

And what the slowdown in comps does in real estate is that it requires us to reformulate or recalculate when we look at new stores with a lower comp base, that means it's a tougher real estate hurdle. So we just had a real estate meeting on Tuesday, and all the sites we were looking at on Tuesday, which was about 10 sites, they all had to have lower comp expectations. And that made achieving our 5-year EVA hurdle more difficult for them. And a couple of them washed out that would have passed in previous real estate meetings with more aggressive comp assumptions. So we've already adjusted, you might say, to a lower comp basis and that makes it more difficult for locations to hit the ROICs and EVAs that we require. I suppose the good news is that even with the lower comps, we still have a lot of sites that are going to be extremely profitable for us and profitable for the shareholders. So I think the key takeaway there is that we're not going to slow down our growth unless we can't find locations that are going to produce 5-year EVAs on a present value basis and give us the returns on invested capital that we're looking for. As long as we can, that's how we're going to continue to manage the business. And so anyway, that's our answer."

I will briefly review the quarter and focus most of my time today on our outlook going forward. Year-over-year, our quarterly sales grew $255 million to a record $3.6 billion. We opened 8 new stores,  increasing",1498,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. I will briefly review the quarter and focus most of my time today on our outlook going forward. Year-over-year, our quarterly sales grew $255 million to a record $3.6 billion. We opened 8 new stores,  increasing our operating square footage 11% to $16 million and expanding our reach to 422 stores across 41 states and 3 countries. On an adjusted basis, comparable store sales increased 2.2% for the quarter, moderating 90 basis points from Q2. We estimate that the negative impact from cannibalization was 30 basis points greater in Q3 than in Q2. Comps improved 20 basis points from the last 9 weeks of Q2 to the first 10 weeks of Q3, driven primarily by a 70 basis point improvement in traffic, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in basket size. We attribute the moderation in basket size primarily due to our value efforts and to cost deflation in few key volume product categories, including produce. 
Comps dropped sharply in week 11, and after our New York City weights and measures audit received national media attention, and averaged just 0.4% for the last 2 weeks of the quarter. We have seen a slight improvement in trends fourth quarter to date. However, comps are still well below our 2.5% average for the 19 weeks prior to the negative publicity. We believe increasing headwinds are also a factor as sales began to stabilize in the last few weeks of Q3 last year. 
I want to take a moment to address the New York City weights and measures audit. As soon as the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs came to us, we worked to understand and address the issues to prevent them from happening again. I want to emphasize these were not systematic, but rather caused by inadvertent human error. The audit included errors that were favorable to customers as well. These are weights and measures issues that can be found in any supermarket. 
Clear and transparent pricing is integral to how we operate. We have taken immediate steps to address these issues including improving our training regarding in-store packing, weighing and labeling processes, and expanding our third-party auditing process company-wide. We built our business on the core value of satisfying and delighting our customers. It is what our customers have grown to love and expect from us and our approach to pricing transparency is no different. If a price is not accurate and not priced in the customer's favor, then that item is free to the customer, no charge, no question. 
Turning back to our results, gross margin, ex LIFO, decreased 66 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. Our results reflect our more aggressive efforts to improve our price relevancy as well as higher shrink in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, given that purchases were planned for a higher level of sales heading into the 4th of July holiday. SG&A increased 24 basis points to 28.4% of sales against a record low in the prior year, due primarily to higher depreciation as a percentage of sales. Results included 21 basis points in expense related to the implementation of California's new paid sick leave law. Despite lower-than-expected sales, we maintained our labor expense disciplines and leveraged wages. 
Our new store class for the last 8 quarters has averaged 38 stores, with sales per gross square foot of approximately $700, translating to productivity levels of 78% on a weighted square footage basis. Comparable stores less than 2 years old have averaged 15% comps and most importantly, a 13% return on invested capital well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered 9.7% EBITDA margin, $287 million of operating cash flow and a 15% return on invested capital. Year-to-date, we have produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $990, over $1 billion in EBITDA and $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we have self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning over $325 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
The Whole Foods Market brand has helped lead the shift in consciousness towards fresh, healthy foods. With 424 stores totaling more than 16 million square feet today, we expect to cross the 500-store mark in fiscal year 2017, and over the longer term, continue to see potential for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. 
As announced last quarter, we are introducing a second format, 365 by Whole Foods Market, which we believe expands our growth opportunity beyond the 1,200 stores. While more streamlined than a typical Whole Foods Market store, our 365 stores will be guided by the same industry-leading quality standards. As a second growth vehicle, 365 will be very complementary to our Whole Foods Market brand, allowing us to address the value-quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 365 President Jeff Turnas is building a top-notch team and has hit the ground running. We are excited today to announce leases for the 5 365 stores in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Portland, Houston and Bellevue, Washington. These are all A+ real estate sites which meet our required EVA-hurdle return. We are currently targeting up to 5 365 store openings in the second half of next calendar year, with the expectation of doubling that number of openings in calendar 2017. With opportunities in new and existing as well as urban and suburban markets, most of our first stores are expected to be in the existing markets to better leverage our existing team member base and infrastructure. Our first 365 by Whole Foods Market store is scheduled to open in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where we converted a lease in development from Whole Foods Market to 365. Los Angeles is the perfect dense urban market, where customers already love our quality standards and transparency to introduce our latest evolution focused on quality food and value in a convenient format. We're excited to reveal more as things develop. 
Turning now to our outlook for Q4, we have opened 2 new stores and expect to open 8 additional stores, including 1 relocation. If current comp trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 7% and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.35. This outlook reflects current trends, as well as some headwinds from moderating inflation, increased cannibalization and our own value efforts. 
For the fiscal year, this translates to sales growth of approximately 9%, with comps in the low-single digits and square footage up 10%. We continue to expect EBITDA margin of approximately 9% and ROIC greater than 14%. For the next fiscal year, we are forecasting ending square footage growth of approximately 9% or 7.5% growth on a weighted square footage basis, reflecting a back-end-loaded store-opening schedule. We will provide additional details in our outlook next quarter. 
In summary, in this retail marketplace, which is more dynamic and competitive than ever, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to position ourself for the long-term. While we acknowledge it is taking longer than we would have hoped, we believe we continue to invest in our price relevancy, our marketing and our technologies the right strategy to regain sales momentum. We are encouraged by the unit lift we have seen from our price investments and will continue to expand on that strategy. We are committed to investing in marketing to support our value efforts as well as our brand and are excited by a new brand campaign this fall. 
Year-to-date, we have made progress in our digital and technology efforts to better serve our customers. We are live with both Workday for all of our team members, have launched our new iOS and Android mobile apps, refreshed our web experience and are testing and evolving our Affinity program. While still in the early stages, we have also piloted our new OnePOS and kiosk ordering for food venues and are rolling out labor scheduling to our customer service teams. We will continue to build out and enhance these efforts next year while also beginning to mobilize our new product platform, which will bring us many new exciting capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, space planning and price optimization. 
We remain focused on innovating and evolving to best serve our customers' diverse purchasing preferences in this rapidly changing marketplace. From the unique experience of our Whole Foods Market stores, to the growing online channel for home delivery, to the exciting launch of our 365 by Whole Foods Market stores, we are leaning in to extend our reach to new as well as existing customers. 
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

I mean, will there be some cannibalization of Whole Foods? I mean, probably, but we don't know exactly how much until we do. It will probably be less than we open up an actual branded Whole Foods Market store because it's going to appeal to a little bit different customer, we think. So it is an experiment. We do have 5 stores committed. We have several other stores we are negotiating leases on.

We've definitely been seeing some deflation in produce and a lot of it is our pricing investments because we're not seeing deflation, for instance, in organic produce, there's a lot of demand there, and there's still upward pressure on prices. And we sell a lot such a high percentage of organic produce that, that affects us. But our pricing initiatives in produce have definitely caused us, overall, to see a lowering of prices. And as I said earlier, we've been very happy with the unit lift there. The other area we've seen a little bit of deflation is in seafood. Some of the higher volume items that we sell like wild salmon at this time of the year is cheaper than last year. Shrimp prices have come down, and we also are selling more of our value frozen program. I know that I've seen some other retailers talk about a deflation in dairy, and while conventional dairy has come down a little bit, organic dairy, which we sell a lot of, is still seeing inflationary pressures. So in cases like that, we're probably dealing more with an issue of not trying not to pass along some of the price increases that we've been seeing to keep those prices reasonable. We're also seeing a little bit of inflation in a few key areas like nuts like almonds and pistachios. They've definitely been seeing a lot of inflation because of the droughts in California. And we sell a lot of olive oil and that's -- there was a big crop failure in Italy this year, so we're seeing a little there. So we're really seeing a little bit going both ways in inflation."

And what the slowdown in comps does in real estate is that it requires us to reformulate or recalculate when we look at new stores with a lower comp base, that means it's a tougher real estate hurdle. So we just had a real estate meeting on Tuesday, and all the sites we were looking at on Tuesday, which was about 10 sites, they all had to have lower comp expectations. And that made achieving our 5-year EVA hurdle more difficult for them. And a couple of them washed out that would have passed in previous real estate meetings with more aggressive comp assumptions. So we've already adjusted, you might say, to a lower comp basis and that makes it  more difficult for locations to hit the ROICs and EVAs that we require. I suppose the good news is that even with the lower comps, we still have a lot of sites that are going to be extremely profitable for us and profitable for the shareholders. So I think the key takeaway there is that we're not going to slow down our growth unless we can't find locations that are going to produce 5-year EVAs on a present value basis and give us the returns on invested capital that we're looking for. As long as we can, that's how we're going to continue to manage the business. And so anyway, that's our answer."

So we've been very encouraged and started to see in the last couple of periods where the actual sales have gone positive, and those produce departments are comping positive now. So that the units now have increased in a lot of them above where the investment is. That's been very encouraging to us, and we definitely have plans to use those learnings in additional stores and regions as we go forward, especially next fiscal year."

I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation and improve our value perception that fundamentally involved in our business. In Q4,",2258,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation and improve our value perception that fundamentally involved in our business. In Q4, our sales increased 6% to a record $3.4 billion. We opened 10 stores, expanding our reach to 431 stores across 42 states and 3 countries. After appearing to stabilize early in the quarter, our comps moderated over the last 9 weeks, driven by changes in both traffic and basket size. Our EPS mix was driven in large part by weaker than anticipated sales. However, we still delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 8% and healthy cash flow from operations at $132 million, and our seasonally slowest sales quarter of the year. In the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still. It's highlighted in our press release we made measurable progress on many of our strategic initiatives over the past year, including using technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. For the fiscal year, we produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $970, over $1.3 billion in EBITDA; a record $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations; and a 15% return on invested capital. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning close to $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the year with approximately $582 million in cash and investments. 
Whole Foods Market has been a driving force in elevating food consciousness and raising the bar on quality standards for 35-plus years. We have a proven track record of delivering long-term shareholder value, and our tremendous success has bred increased competition. Our partners at United Natural Foods estimated over 70,000 new points of retail from natural organic products over the last 3 years. In this dynamic and increasingly competitive marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper in creating a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. Later, I will outline the decisive steps we are taking to enrich the customer experience and gain efficiencies on our overall cost structure. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Some would say increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters. The reality is Whole Foods Market sells the highest quality food in the world, our standards lead the industry and our selection and in-store experience cannot be matched by the competition. Yes, we're going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality selection service. We believe values matter. It is what our customers tell us they love most about us, and we're not going to change that. 
One of the things we're doing is launching 365 by Whole Foods Market, a complementary brand that will broaden our reach to new customers and new markets, guided by the same industry leading quality standards, our 365 stores will allow us to address the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. There has never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who's growing it. I believe we'll look back in 2015 and recognize it as the tipping point of the food revolution in this country about the direct connection between what you eat, your health and well-being. 
At the same time, food retailing is rapidly evolving in new ways from online delivery in 1 hour to click and collect, to personal shoppers. Some now estimate online sales could grow from 2.5% of total food retail sales to 8% or $100 billion by year 2025. Going forward, we envision a fusion of the store experience and technology that the customer center. No one delivers the dynamic in-store experience that we do. We will keep innovating and creating environments where people can connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Our strategy revolves around leading the race to the top in terms of the differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on quality and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. As the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods is awakening and the ways in which people want to buy their food evolve, the market opportunity is continuing to expand. There will be more than one winner. It is not a zero-sum game. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever and where our company is today is just a fraction of where we think we'll be 20 years from now. 
As I highlighted earlier, while we're making progress on many of our initiatives in this dynamic marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper to rebuild traffic and sales and create a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. These are the steps we are taking to communicate our differentiation and prove our price perception and fundamentally evolve our business. One, we are committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business and it's already taking steps from this direction. We have a plan to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are systematically looking at every aspect of our business to eliminate cost that do not produce value for our customers. We recently eliminated more than 2,000 positions, are transforming our purchasing operations to allow us to function more productivity, to be more competitive and better leverage our growing size and scale and are looking for similar opportunities in other key areas. We have also introduced a new labor scheduling tool to our customer service teams with plans to expand to additional teams over the next year. Number two, we will innovate faster to further differentiate the Whole Foods Market shopping experience with the focus on our exclusive brands and prepared foods. We are operating some of the highest volume restaurants in the country and no house brand comes close to the quality standards of our exclusive brand products. Totaling close to $5 billion or 1/3 of our sales, our exclusive brands and prepared foods are key differentiators for us and we plan to partner with our suppliers to widen our competitive advantage in these areas. As part of this initiative, we have created a new global vice president of culinary and hospitality position, which we expect to fill in the coming months. Number three, we will improve our value perception through increase promotional activity and selective and strategic price reductions. We will utilize new talent, tools and systems, as well as consumer insights, benchmarks and KPI progress reporting to better track how our promotions and investments resonate with customers and impact our results. Number four, we will support our differentiation value strategies through enhanced external marketing efforts. We will use media to support our pricing efforts across all major markets, clearly communicating not only our pricing investments but our quality as well. We will holistically address the way in which we communicate our value and values to our customers at every touch point, including our online, digital and social platforms. Number five, we will invest in digital strategies to convert the strong traffic we generate online into sales. We have integrated Instacart into our app. We'll soon launch a national sales flyer and we'll continue to make updates to provide more functionality and streamline our customer's digital experience. We've been very pleased with our Affinity pilot in terms of the information we were gathering and the sales lift it is generating. We are committed to the program and our plans to test additional markets to further enhance the customer experience and refine the economics before rolling it out nationally. Number six, we will invest in our technology platforms to provide a better shopping experience and enable us to run our business more efficiently. We will replace our disparate core legacy platforms with unified, scalable solutions. The roll out of one POS system to all U.S. stores by the end of calendar 2016 will provide faster checkout times, improved labor productivity and better data visibility across all channels. In addition, it will enable us to provide personalized offers and new experiences at checkout via our mobile app. We also just launched our groundbreaking partnership with In 4 to co-create a next-generation cloud base retail merchandising and supply chain management platform. Admittedly behind in this area, this new retail platform will be unlike anything available today and will bring us many new capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, retail space planning and price optimization. Number seven, we will launch our second growth vehicle, 365 by Whole Foods Market. With 8 leases signed to date, we plan to open 3 stores in fiscal year 2016 and up to 10 stores in fiscal year 2017. The time is right to take the high quality standards we have developed over the last 35-plus years and make them more broadly accessible through a streamlined, value-focused format and serve communities we would not be able to reach with our larger Whole Foods Market stores. Number eight, while we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we will increase our square footage in a more moderate pace this year. Having consecutively accelerated store openings over the past 6 years, we plan to grow our square footage at a more moderate pace in fiscal year 2016. We will lessen -- which will lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our comps and allow us to focus on the other areas we have outlined. Number nine, we will continue to affirm our culture. Our 91,000 team members are the heart and soul of our company and the not-so-secret ingredient in creating customer experience. We believe our full-time ratio is among the highest and our turnover is among the lowest in the industry. We will continue to invest in our team members' development and growth, including creating thousands of new jobs over the coming year. 
I will now turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2016, which reflects the impact of these initiatives. We remain focused on the metrics we believe are key to the long-term health of our business and for this fiscal year we are targeting. Sales growth of  3% to 5%; approximately 30 new stores, including 2 to 3 relocations and 3,365 stores; square footage growth of 7% or greater; EBITDA margin of approximately 8.5%; CapEx of approximately 5% of sales and an ROIC greater than 13.5%. Our results are highly dependent on comps which have been particularly difficult to predict in this competitive landscape. While we have seen some stabilization in our 2 year comp trends since the end of the fourth quarter, it has only been 5 weeks. We're hopeful that our comps will improve over the course of the year given our toughest comparisons is in the first quarter. And many of our sales building initiatives are still gaining traction or are planned to roll out later this year. The higher end of our sales outlook reflects a 2.8% 2 year comp in line with the current run rate and implies flat comps for the year, improving from negative 2% in Q1 to relatively flat in Q2 and Q3 to 3% positive by Q4. The lower end of our sales outlook reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year. Primarily reflecting our value efforts, we expect the decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, to be greater than last year's 45 basis points decline. While we have identified SG&A improvements of approximately 60 basis points, including the impact of the recent restructuring, we expect these savings to be more than offset by the cost of initiatives to drive traffic and sales, as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other costs. Therefore, we expect to decline an operating margin of up to 75 basis points from the 6.1% we recorded last year, excluding charges. As we announced today, our board approved an additional $1 billion in stock buyback authority and our intent is to spend the majority of that in the first half of the year. Excluding an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 per share and net accretion related to these debt-financed buybacks, we expect EPS for the fiscal year of $1.50 or greater. We will be facing our toughest comp and earnings comparisons in the first quarter and estimate approximately a $0.01 per share in costs associated with the current recent restructuring. 
I know that we have shared a lot of information with you today, but before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we recognize we have our work cut out for us. We believe we're taking the necessary steps to regain our sales momentum, fundamentally evolve our business model and produce the returns that the investment community expects from us and that we expect from ourselves. 
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central time today. So to allow more time for questions, please limit yourself to one question at a time so everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

That means Whole Foods does move, sometimes can move a little bit slowly, but it means oftentimes we'll make better decisions because of the inclusive nature of it. But it was a good question because we are thinking deeply about it. And I think the fact that we're so conscious of it means that we're less likely to just do something inadvertently to screw it up.

But first thing I would say is that a lot of the folks that are copying Whole Foods at this point, they're not copying our quality standards. They're copying our look and feel and our marketing. And so far, it's a good strategy, it's working. Many customers are not looking before or not seeing the differences. So one of the challenges Whole Foods has to do better job at is communicating our superior quality. The differentiation, it's there, it's definitely there in the perishables from our animal welfare system and need to sustainable seafood, though our responsibly grown produce. We have to do a better job of connecting to our customers to get them to understand that these are not the same things. They may look quite like the same, but they're not. We don't want to have a race to the bottom, we don't want to compromise our quality and start cutting our quality to make us more competitive on price. Sure, if you're in an center store and if they have exactly the same items then we are absolutely right. We have to be price relevant, we have to be very close or matched on those items and we're working on that. So it's simultaneously we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation and where we have price or thumbs are out of line.

The question is, can you continue to show it? I mean, we showed 8%, 9% comps for 20 consecutive years, just about. So our challenge, and it's a big challenge, is what I started out by saying we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation so the customers understand our quality superiority and at the same time, there are no significant differentiating advantages. There is no quality standard differential. A, that is a challenge to differentiate and up the quality standards, but in many cases, that is being more price relevant.

And then finally, just your thoughts on how deep or broad-based the investments needed to be to get the desired effect on the volume front?"

And we're also looking to do increased promotions throughout a lot of other parts of the company and specifically where we do them, it really depends on us as we were saying earlier, every market's different.

I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation, improve our value perception and fundamentally evolve our business.

I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation, improve our value perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
In Q4, our sales increased 6% to a record $3.4 billion. We opened 10 stores, expanding our reach to 431 stores across 42 states and 3 countries. After appearing to stabilize early in the quarter, our comps moderated over the last 9 weeks, driven by changes in both traffic and basket size. 
Our EPS miss was driven in large part by weaker-than-anticipated sales. However, we still delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 8% and healthy cash flow from operations at $132 million and our seasonally slowest sales quarter of the year. 
In the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still. It's highlighted in our press release, we made measurable progress on many of our strategic initiatives over the past year including using technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
For the fiscal year, we produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $970, over $1.3 billion in EBITDA; a record $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations; and a 15% return on invested capital. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning close to $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the year with approximately $582 million in cash and investments. 
Whole Foods Market has been a driving force in elevating food consciousness and raising the bar on quality standards for 35-plus years. We have a proven track record of delivering long-term shareholder value, and our tremendous success has bred increased competition. Our partners at United Natural Foods estimated over 70,000 new points of retail from natural and organic products over the last 3 years. 
In this dynamic and increasingly competitive marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper in creating a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. Later, I will outline the decisive steps we are taking to enrich the customer experience and gain efficiencies on our overall cost structure. 
Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Some would say increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters. The reality is Whole Foods Market sells the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry, and our selection and in-store experience cannot be matched by the competition. Yes, we're going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, selection and service. We believe values matter. It is what our customers tell us they love most about us, and we're not going to change that. 
One of the things we're doing is launching 365 by Whole Foods Market, a complementary brand that will broaden our reach to new customers and new markets. Guided by the same industry-leading quality standards, our 365 stores will allow us to address the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 
There has never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who's growing it. I believe we'll look back on 2015 and recognize it as the tipping point of the food revelation -- revolution in this country about the direct connection between what you eat, your health and well-being. 
At the same time, food retailing is rapidly evolving in new ways from online delivery in 1 hour to click and collect, to personal shoppers. Some now estimate online sales could grow from 2.5% of total food retail sales to 8% or $100 billion by year 2025. Going forward, we envision a fusion of the store experience and technology with the customer center. 
No one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We will keep innovating and creating environments where people can connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Our strategy revolves around leading the race to the top in terms of the differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on quality and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
As the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods is awakening and the ways in which people want to buy their food evolve, the market opportunity is continuing to expand. There will be more than one winner. It is not a 0-sum game. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever, and where our company is today is just a fraction of where we think we'll be 20 years from now. 
As I highlighted earlier, while we're making progress on many of our initiatives in this dynamic marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper to rebuild traffic and sales and create a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. These are the steps we are taking to communicate our differentiation and prove our price perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
One, we are committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business and are already taking steps in this direction. We have a plan to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are systematically looking at every aspect of our business to eliminate cost that do not produce value for our customers. We recently eliminated more than 2,000 positions, are transforming our purchasing operations to allow us to function more productively, to be more competitive, and better leverage our growing size and scale, and are looking for similar opportunities in other key areas. We have also introduced a new labor scheduling tool to our customer service teams with plans to expand to additional teams over the next year. 
Number two, we will innovate faster to further differentiate the Whole Foods Market shopping experience with the focus on our exclusive brands and prepared foods. We are operating some of the highest volume restaurants in the country, and no house brand comes close to the quality standards of our exclusive brand products. Totaling close to $5 billion or 1/3 of our sales, our exclusive brands and prepared foods are key differentiators for us, and we plan to partner with our suppliers to widen our competitive advantage in these areas. As part of this initiative, we have created a new Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality Position, which we expect to fill in the next -- in the coming months. 
Number three, we will improve our value perception through increased promotional activity and selective and strategic price reductions. We will utilize new talent, tools and systems as well as consumer insights, benchmarks and KPI progress reporting to better track how our promotions and investments resonate with customers and impact our results. 
Number four, we will support our differentiation value strategies through enhanced external marketing efforts. We will use media to support our pricing efforts across all major markets, clearly communicating not only our pricing investments but our quality as well. We will holistically address the way in which we communicate our value and values to our customers at every touch point including our online, digital and social platforms. 
Number five, we will invest in digital strategies to convert the strong traffic we generate online into sales. We have integrated Instacart into our app. We'll soon launch a national sales flyer, and we'll continue to make upgrades to provide more functionality and streamline our customer's digital experience. We have been very pleased with our Affinity pilot in terms of the information we were gathering and the sales lift it is generating. We are committed to the program and have plans for testing additional markets to further enhance the customer experience and refine the economics before rolling it out nationally. 
Number six, we will invest in our technology platforms to provide a better shopping experience and enable us to run our business more efficiently. We will replace our disparate core legacy platforms with unified, scalable solutions. The roll-out of one POS system to all U.S. stores by the end of calendar 2016 will provide faster checkout times, improved labor productivity and better data visibility across all channels. In addition, it will enable us to provide personalized offers and new experiences at checkout via our mobile app. We also just launched our groundbreaking partnership with Infor to co-create a next-generation cloud-based retail merchandising and supply chain management platform. Admittedly, behind in this area, this new retail platform will be unlike anything available today and will bring us many new capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, retail space planning and price optimization. 
Number seven, we will launch our second growth vehicle, 365 by Whole Foods Market. With 8 leases signed to date, we plan to open 3 stores in fiscal year 2016 and up to 10 stores in fiscal year 2017. The time is right to take the high-quality standards we have developed over the last 35-plus years and make them more broadly accessible through a streamlined, value-focused format and serve communities we would not be able to reach with our larger Whole Foods Market stores. 
Number eight, while we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we will increase our square footage in a more moderate pace this year. Having consecutively accelerated store openings over the past 6 years, we plan to grow our square footage at a more moderate pace in fiscal year 2016. We will lessen -- which will lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our comps and allow us to focus on the other areas we have outlined. 
Number nine, we will continue to affirm our culture. Our 91,000 team members are the heart and soul of our company and the not-so-secret ingredient in creating our customer experience. We believe our full-time ratio is among the highest, and our turnover is among the lowest in the industry. We will continue to invest in our team members' development and growth including creating thousands of new jobs over the coming year. 
I will now turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2016, which reflects the impact of these initiatives. We remain focused on the metrics we believe are key to the long-term health of our business and for this fiscal year we are targeting: sales growth of  3% to 5%; approximately 30 new stores, including 2 to 3 relocations and 3,365 stores; square footage growth of 7% or greater; EBITDA margin of approximately 8.5%; CapEx of approximately 5% of sales, and an ROIC greater than 13.5%. 
Our results are highly dependent on comps, which have been particularly difficult to predict in this competitive landscape. While we have seen some stabilization in our 2-year comp trends since the end of the fourth quarter, it has only been 5 weeks. We're hopeful that our comps will improve over the course of the year given our toughest comparisons is in the first quarter, and many of our sales building initiatives are still gaining traction or are planned to roll out later this year. 
The higher end of our sales outlook reflects a 2.8% 2-year comp in line with the current run rate and implies flat comps for the year, improving from negative 2% in Q1 to relatively flat in Q2 and Q3 to 3% positive by Q4. The lower end of our sales outlook reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year. 
Primarily reflecting our value efforts, we expect a decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, to be greater than last year's 45 basis points decline. While we have identified SG&A improvements of approximately 60 basis points, including the impact of the recent restructuring, we expect these savings to be more than offset by the cost of initiatives to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other cost. Therefore, we expect to decline an operating margin of up to 75 basis points from the 6.1% we recorded last year, excluding charges. 
As we announced today, our board approved an additional $1 billion in stock buyback authority, and our intent is to spend the majority of that in the first half of the year. Excluding an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 per share and net accretion related to these debt-financed buybacks, we expect EPS for the fiscal year of $1.50 or greater. We will be facing our toughest comp and earnings comparisons in the first quarter and estimate approximately a $0.01 per share in costs associated with the current -- recent restructuring. 
I know that we have shared a lot of information with you today, but before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we recognize we have our work cut out for us. We believe we're taking the necessary steps to regain our sales momentum, fundamentally evolve our business model and produce the returns that the investment community expects from us and that we expect from ourselves. 
We will now take questions. Our calls will end at 4:45 Central time today. So to allow more time for questions, please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

So the art of what we're trying to do is we want to evolve the structuring in such a way that we take out redundancy in ways, and at the same time though, we're not diminishing the culture, the empowerment efforts that make Whole Foods Market special. And that just means that we have to proceed very thoughtfully, very carefully. And we have to be very inclusive in making the decisions so the voices are heard. That means Whole Foods does move, sometimes can move a little bit slowly, but it means oftentimes, we'll make better decisions because of the inclusive nature of it. But it was a good question because we are thinking deeply about it, and I think the fact that we're so conscious of it means that we're less likely to just do something inadvertently to screw it up.

Just a couple examples to think about, it's also we also have the ability to eliminate some positions because we no longer need it based on technological things we put in our stores. So for example, the new labor scheduling tool in the big stores, in one of our big New York City stores, we might have somebody working 40 hours a week on the labor schedule just for the customer service team, just the cashiers. Now we have -- our new system actually predicts the scheduling so we probably can reduce that to 20 hours instead of 40 hours, so that's just cost that we can take out of the system without radically changing our culture at all."

And at this point, we see pretty much the perishables for produce, meats, seafood, they will be still largely directed by the regional teams with the global teams, helping them on that. So the real exciting stuff in the store is pretty much still going to be mostly run by the regional teams. It's really in the center store where we're looking at doing a lot more -- bringing a lot more responsibility for centers to our products at global, the global team. So why that make sense is that there's -- we work with our very large center store suppliers, and we feel like we can most efficiently work with them and get the best -- have the best partnership with them at the global level. But there'll still be a strong regional component. We're still going to have the regional folks very involved in those decisions, but we think that we can -- by improving our overall functionality in that area, we think that we can come to lot better decisions that really work across the company."

So one of the challenges Whole Foods has to do better job at is communicating our superior quality, the differentiation. It's there. It's definitely there in the perishables from our animal welfare system and meat, to our sustainable seafood, to our responsibly-grown produce. So we have to do a better job of connecting to our customers to get them to understand that these are not the same things. They may look likely the same, but they're not.

We probably expect to move the needle next year, although we have to see exactly what works, how it works, how the customers respond to the particular combination of value and quality.

We just have a lot more running room. Stores are less congested. It's just easier to do. And while we do think we can increase our comps and we do think we can increase our sales per square foot. It's just our success has become just a higher hurdle for us to jump over. And if you're starting in a lower base as many of our competitors are, it's easy to show a higher comp number. The question is, can you continue to show it? I mean, we showed 8%, 9% comps for 20 consecutive years, just about. So our challenge, and it's a big challenge, is what I started out by saying we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation so the customers understand our quality superiority. And at the same time, we're -- there are no significant differentiating advantages. There is no quality standard differential. Well, a, that's a challenge to differentiate the quality standard. But in many cases, it means being more price relevant. And those are that 2 things we intend to do a better job at both of them going forward."

I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation, improve our value perception and fundamentally evolve our business. In Q4, our sa",2260,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation, improve our value perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
In Q4, our sales increased 6% to a record $3.4 billion. We opened 10 stores, expanding our reach to 431 stores across 42 states and 3 countries. After appearing to stabilize early in the quarter, our comps moderated over the last 9 weeks, driven by changes in both traffic and basket size. 
Our EPS miss was driven in large part by weaker-than-anticipated sales. However, we still delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 8% and healthy cash flow from operations of $132 million and our seasonally slowest sales quarter of the year. 
In the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still. As highlighted in our press release, we made measurable progress on many of our strategic initiatives over the past year including using technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
For the fiscal year, we produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $970, over $1.3 billion in EBITDA; a record $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations; and a 15% return on invested capital. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning close to $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the year with approximately $582 million in cash and investments. 
Whole Foods Market has been a driving force in elevating food consciousness and raising the bar on quality standards for 35-plus years. We have a proven track record of delivering long-term shareholder value, and our tremendous success has bred increased competition. Our partners at United Natural Foods estimated over 70,000 new points of retail from natural and organic products over the last 3 years. 
In this dynamic and increasingly competitive marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper in creating a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. Later, I will outline the decisive steps we are taking to enrich the customer experience and gain efficiencies on our overall cost structure. 
Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Some would say increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters. The reality is Whole Foods Market sells the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry, and our selection and in-store experience cannot be matched by the competition. Yes, we're going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, selection and service. We believe values matter. It is what our customers tell us they love most about us, and we're not going to change that. 
One of the things we're doing is launching 365 by Whole Foods Market, a complementary brand that will broaden our reach to new customers and new markets. Guided by the same industry-leading quality standards, our 365 stores will allow us to address the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 
There has never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who's growing it. I believe we'll look back on 2015 and recognize it as the tipping point of the food revelation -- revolution in this country about the direct connection between what you eat, your health and well-being. 
At the same time, food retailing is rapidly evolving in new ways from online delivery in 1 hour to click and collect, to personal shoppers. Some now estimate online sales could grow from 2.5% of total food retail sales to 8% or $100 billion by year 2025. Going forward, we envision a fusion of the store experience and technology with the customer center. 
No one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We will keep innovating and creating environments where people can connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Our strategy revolves around leading the race to the top in terms of the differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on quality and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
As the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods is awakening and the ways in which people want to buy their food evolve, the market opportunity is continuing to expand. There will be more than one winner. It is not a 0-sum game. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever, and where our company is today is just a fraction of where we think we'll be 20 years from now. 
As I highlighted earlier, while we're making progress on many of our initiatives in this dynamic marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper to rebuild traffic and sales and create a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. These are the steps we are taking to communicate our differentiation and prove our price perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
One, we are committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business and have already taking steps in this direction. We have a plan to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are systematically looking at every aspect of our business to eliminate cost that do not produce value for our customers. We recently eliminated more than 2,000 positions, are transforming our purchasing operations to allow us to function more productively, to be more competitive, and better leverage our growing size and scale, and are looking for similar opportunities in other key areas. We have also introduced a new labor scheduling tool to our customer service teams with plans to expand to additional teams over the next year. 
Number two, we will innovate faster to further differentiate the Whole Foods Market shopping experience with the focus on our exclusive brands and prepared foods. We are operating some of the highest volume restaurants in the country, and no house brand comes close to the quality standards of our exclusive brand products. Totaling close to $5 billion or 1/3 of our sales, our exclusive brands and prepared foods are key differentiators for us, and we plan to partner with our suppliers to widen our competitive advantage in these areas. As part of this initiative, we have created a new Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality Position, which we expect to fill in the next -- in the coming months. 
Number three, we will improve our value perception through increased promotional activity and selective and strategic price reductions. We will utilize new talent, tools and systems as well as consumer insights, benchmarks and KPI progress reporting to better track how our promotions and investments resonate with customers and impact our results. 
Number four, we will support our differentiation value strategies through enhanced external marketing efforts. We will use media to support our pricing efforts across all major markets, clearly communicating not only our pricing investments but our quality as well. We will holistically address the way in which we communicate our value and values to our customers at every touch point including our online, digital and social platforms. 
Number five, we will invest in digital strategies to convert the strong traffic we generate online into sales. We have integrated Instacart into our app. We'll soon launch a national sales flyer, and we'll continue to make upgrades to provide more functionality and streamline our customer's digital experience. We have been very pleased with our Affinity pilot in terms of the information we were gathering and the sales lift it is generating. We are committed to the program and have plans for testing additional markets to further enhance the customer experience and refine the economics before rolling it out nationally. 
Number six, we will invest in our technology platforms to provide a better shopping experience and enable us to run our business more efficiently. We will replace our disparate core legacy platforms with unified, scalable solutions. The roll-out of one POS system to all U.S. stores by the end of calendar 2016 will provide faster checkout times, improved labor productivity and better data visibility across all channels. In addition, it will enable us to provide personalized offers and new experiences at checkout via our mobile app. We also just launched our groundbreaking partnership with Infor to co-create a next-generation cloud-based retail merchandising and supply chain management platform. Admittedly, behind in this area, this new retail platform will be unlike anything available today and will bring us many new capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, retail space planning and price optimization. 
Number seven, we will launch our second growth vehicle, 365 by Whole Foods Market. With 8 leases signed to date, we plan to open 3 stores in fiscal year 2016 and up to 10 stores in fiscal year 2017. The time is right to take the high-quality standards we have developed over the last 35-plus years and make them more broadly accessible through a streamlined, value-focused format and serve communities we would not be able to reach with our larger Whole Foods Market stores. 
Number eight, while we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we will increase our square footage in a more moderate pace this year. Having consecutively accelerated store openings over the past 6 years, we plan to grow our square footage at a more moderate pace in fiscal year 2016. We will lessen -- which will lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our comps and allow us to focus on the other areas we have outlined. 
Number nine, we will continue to affirm our culture. Our 91,000 team members are the heart and soul of our company and the not-so-secret ingredient in creating our customer experience. We believe our full-time ratio is among the highest, and our turnover is among the lowest in the industry. We will continue to invest in our team members' development and growth including creating thousands of new jobs over the coming year. 
I will now turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2016, which reflects the impact of these initiatives. We remain focused on the metrics we believe are key to the long-term health of our business and for this fiscal year we are targeting: sales growth of  3% to 5%; approximately 30 new stores, including 2 to 3 relocations and 3,365 stores; square footage growth of 7% or greater; EBITDA margin of approximately 8.5%; CapEx of approximately 5% of sales, and an ROIC greater than 13.5%. 
Our results are highly dependent on comps, which have been particularly difficult to predict in this competitive landscape. While we have seen some stabilization in our 2-year comp trends since the end of the fourth quarter, it has only been 5 weeks. We're hopeful that our comps will improve over the course of the year given our toughest comparisons is in the first quarter, and many of our sales building initiatives are still gaining traction or are planned to roll out later this year. 
The higher end of our sales outlook reflects a 2.8% 2-year comp in line with the current run rate and implies flat comps for the year, improving from negative 2% in Q1 to relatively flat in Q2 and Q3 to 3% positive by Q4. The lower end of our sales outlook reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year. 
Primarily reflecting our value efforts, we expect a decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, to be greater than last year's 45 basis points decline. While we have identified SG&A improvements of approximately 60 basis points, including the impact of the recent restructuring, we expect these savings to be more than offset by the cost of initiatives to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other cost. Therefore, we expect to decline an operating margin of up to 75 basis points from the 6.1% we recorded last year, excluding charges. 
As we announced today, our board approved an additional $1 billion in stock buyback authority, and our intent is to spend the majority of that in the first half of the year. Excluding an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 per share and net accretion related to these debt-financed buybacks, we expect EPS for the fiscal year of $1.50 or greater. We will be facing our toughest comp and earnings comparisons in the first quarter and estimate approximately a $0.01 per share in costs associated with the current -- recent restructuring. 
I know that we shared a lot of information with you today, but before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we recognize we have our work cut out for us. We believe we're taking the necessary steps to regain our sales momentum, fundamentally evolve our business model and produce the returns that the investment community expects from us and that we expect from ourselves. 
We will now take questions. Our calls will end at 4:45 Central time today. So to allow more time for questions, please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

And we know, in many cases, such as purchasing, we want to take advantage of our scale. We want to -- we have a redundancy built into the system. So the art of what we're trying to do is we want to evolve the structuring in such a way that we take out redundancy and waste, and at the same time though, we're not diminishing the culture, the empowerment efforts that make Whole Foods Market special. And that just means that we have to proceed very thoughtfully, very carefully. And we have to be very inclusive in making the decisions so the voices are heard. That means Whole Foods does move, sometimes can move a little bit slowly, but it means oftentimes, we'll make better decisions because of the inclusive nature of it. But it was a good question because we are thinking deeply about it, and I think the fact that we're so conscious of it means that we're less likely to just do something inadvertently to screw it up. We are determined to evolve, so we are going to evolve, but we're going to take our culture with it."

Obviously, at this point, we've grown to be of $16 billion year in sales. All those functions have evolved over time, as you see in different ways and in different regions. And so I think the company as a whole has come to a place now recognizing that there some of those things that don't need to be done in that way anymore that are best done together in one way and then still identifying clearly those areas where they're close to the customer, where the innovation and where the freedom remains, if that makes a lot of sense to do. So that's the nature of the conversation. So an answer to your answer, we're looking at TMS HR, we're looking at marketing, we're looking at purchasing. We actually have a very evolved plan for -- exactly how purchasing is going to unfold.

And we've got work to do to take that same in-store experience that we have created so well over the years and take that and extend it and -- onto the digital platforms where our customers come. We have 6 million visitors a month to our website. That's a pretty high number for a supermarket and relative to our -- and I think -- so we have opportunities to convert those and continue to build trips through that, so essentially, extending our experience in having a digital door to Whole Foods as well as a physical store."

That's another good question because that's something we're continually talking about and strategizing about and evolving our position on it. But first thing I would say is that a lot of the folks that are copying Whole Foods at this point, they're not copying our quality standards. They're copying our look and feel and our marketing. And so far, it's a good strategy. It's working. Many customers are not looking [indiscernible]. They're not seeing the differences. So one of the challenges Whole Foods has to do better job at is communicating our superior quality, the differentiation. It's there. It's definitely there in the perishables from our animal welfare system and meat, to our sustainable seafood, to our responsibly-grown produce. So we have to do a better job of connecting to our customers to get them to understand that these are not the same things. They may look like they're the same, but they're not. And we don't want to have a race to the bottom. We don't want to compromise our quality and start cutting our quality to make us more competitive on price. Sure, if you're on center store, and these -- and if they have exactly the same items, then we are -- you're absolutely right. We have to be price relevant. We have to be very close or matched on those items, and we're working on that. So it's simultaneously, we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation and where we have price or thumbs were out of line, it is not appropriate. We have to be more competitive in those areas, and we are determined to do so."

We probably expect to move the needle next year, although we have to see exactly what works, how it works, how the customers respond to the particular combination of value and quality.

We just have a lot more running room. Stores are less congested. It's just easier to do. And while we do think we can increase our comps and we do think we can increase our sales per square foot. It's just our success has become just a higher hurdle for us to jump over. And if you're starting in a lower base as many of our competitors are, it's easy to show a higher comp number. The question is, can you continue to show it? I mean, we showed 8%, 9% comps for 20 consecutive years, just about. So our challenge, and it's a big challenge, is what I started out by saying we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation so the customers understand our quality superiority. And at the same time, we're -- there are no significant differentiating advantages. There is no quality standard differential. Well, a, that's a challenge to differentiate and up the quality standard. But in many cases, it means being more price relevant. And those are that 2 things we intend to do a better job at both of them going forward."

I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation, improve our value perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
In Q4, our sales increased 6% to a record $3.4 billion. We opened 10 stores, expanding our reach to 431 stores across 42 states and 3 countries. After appearing to stabilize early in the quarter, our comps moderated over the last 9 weeks, driven by changes in both traffic and basket size. 
Our EPS miss was driven in large part by weaker-than-anticipated sales. However, we still delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 8% and healthy cash flow from operations of $132 million and our seasonally slowest sales quarter of the year. 
In the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still. As highlighted in our press release, we made measurable progress on many of our strategic initiatives over the past year including using technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
For the fiscal year, we produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $970, over $1.3 billion in EBITDA; a record $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations; and a 15% return on invested capital. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning close to $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the year with approximately $582 million in cash and investments. 
Whole Foods Market has been a driving force in elevating food consciousness and raising the bar on quality standards for 35-plus years. We have a proven track record of delivering long-term shareholder value, and our tremendous success has bred increased competition. Our partners at United Natural Foods estimated over 70,000 new points of retail from natural and organic products over the last 3 years. 
In this dynamic and increasingly competitive marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper in creating a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. Later, I will outline the decisive steps we are taking to enrich the customer experience and gain efficiencies on our overall cost structure. 
Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Some would say increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters. The reality is Whole Foods Market sells the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry, and our selection and in-store experience cannot be matched by the competition. Yes, we're going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, selection and service. We believe values matter. It is what our customers tell us they love most about us, and we're not going to change that. 
One of the things we're doing is launching 365 by Whole Foods Market, a complementary brand that will broaden our reach to new customers and new markets. Guided by the same industry-leading quality standards, our 365 stores will allow us to address the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 
There has never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who's growing it. I believe we'll look back on 2015 and recognize it as the tipping point of the food revelation -- revolution in this country about the direct connection between what you eat, your health and well-being. 
At the same time, food retailing is rapidly evolving in new ways from online delivery in 1 hour to click and collect, to personal shoppers. Some now estimate online sales could grow from 2.5% of total food retail sales to 8% or $100 billion by year 2025. Going forward, we envision a fusion of the store experience and technology with the customer center. 
No one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We will keep innovating and creating environments where people can connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Our strategy revolves around leading the race to the top in terms of the differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on quality and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
As the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods is awakening and the ways in which people want to buy their food evolve, the market opportunity is continuing to expand. There will be more than one winner. It is not a 0-sum game. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever, and where our company is today is just a fraction of where we think we'll be 20 years from now. 
As I highlighted earlier, while we're making progress on many of our initiatives in this dynamic marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper to rebuild traffic and sales and create a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. These are the steps we are taking to communicate our differentiation and prove our price perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
One, we are committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business and have already taking steps in this direction. We have a plan to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are systematically looking at every aspect of our business to eliminate cost that do not produce value for our customers. We recently eliminated more than 2,000 positions, are transforming our purchasing operations to allow us to function more productively, to be more competitive, and better leverage our growing size and scale, and are looking for similar opportunities in other key areas. We have also introduced a new labor scheduling tool to our customer service teams with plans to expand to additional teams over the next year. 
Number two, we will innovate faster to further differentiate the Whole Foods Market shopping experience with the focus on our exclusive brands and prepared foods. We are operating some of the highest volume restaurants in the country, and no house brand comes close to the quality standards of our exclusive brand products. Totaling close to $5 billion or 1/3 of our sales, our exclusive brands and prepared foods are key differentiators for us, and we plan to partner with our suppliers to widen our competitive advantage in these areas. As part of this initiative, we have created a new Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality Position, which we expect to fill in the next -- in the coming months. 
Number three, we will improve our value perception through increased promotional activity and selective and strategic price reductions. We will utilize new talent, tools and systems as well as consumer insights, benchmarks and KPI progress reporting to better track how our promotions and investments resonate with customers and impact our results. 
Number four, we will support our differentiation value strategies through enhanced external marketing efforts. We will use media to support our pricing efforts across all major markets, clearly communicating not only our pricing investments but our quality as well. We will holistically address the way in which we communicate our value and values to our customers at every touch point including our online, digital and social platforms. 
Number five, we will invest in digital strategies to convert the strong traffic we generate online into sales. We have integrated Instacart into our app. We'll soon launch a national sales flyer, and we'll continue to make upgrades to provide more functionality and streamline our customer's digital experience. We have been very pleased with our Affinity pilot in terms of the information we were gathering and the sales lift it is generating. We are committed to the program and have plans for testing additional markets to further enhance the customer experience and refine the economics before rolling it out nationally. 
Number six, we will invest in our technology platforms to provide a better shopping experience and enable us to run our business more efficiently. We will replace our disparate core legacy platforms with unified, scalable solutions. The roll-out of one POS system to all U.S. stores by the end of calendar 2016 will provide faster checkout times, improved labor productivity and better data visibility across all channels. In addition, it will enable us to provide personalized offers and new experiences at checkout via our mobile app. We also just launched our groundbreaking partnership with Infor to co-create a next-generation cloud-based retail merchandising and supply chain management platform. Admittedly, behind in this area, this new retail platform will be unlike anything available today and will bring us many new capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, retail space planning and price optimization. 
Number seven, we will launch our second growth vehicle, 365 by Whole Foods Market. With 8 leases signed to date, we plan to open 3 stores in fiscal year 2016 and up to 10 stores in fiscal year 2017. The time is right to take the high-quality standards we have developed over the last 35-plus years and make them more broadly accessible through a streamlined, value-focused format and serve communities we would not be able to reach with our larger Whole Foods Market stores. 
Number eight, while we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we will increase our square footage in a more moderate pace this year. Having consecutively accelerated store openings over the past 6 years, we plan to grow our square footage at a more moderate pace in fiscal year 2016. We will lessen -- which will lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our comps and allow us to focus on the other areas we have outlined. 
Number nine, we will continue to affirm our culture. Our 91,000 team members are the heart and soul of our company and the not-so-secret ingredient in creating our customer experience. We believe our full-time ratio is among the highest, and our turnover is among the lowest in the industry. We will continue to invest in our team members' development and growth including creating thousands of new jobs over the coming year. 
I will now turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2016, which reflects the impact of these initiatives. We remain focused on the metrics we believe are key to the long-term health of our business and for this fiscal year we are targeting: sales growth of  3% to 5%; approximately 30 new stores, including 2 to 3 relocations and 3,365 stores; square footage growth of 7% or greater; EBITDA margin of approximately 8.5%; CapEx of approximately 5% of sales, and an ROIC greater than 13.5%. 
Our results are highly dependent on comps, which have been particularly difficult to predict in this competitive landscape. While we have seen some stabilization in our 2-year comp trends since the end of the fourth quarter, it has only been 5 weeks. We're hopeful that our comps will improve over the course of the year given our toughest comparisons is in the first quarter, and many of our sales building initiatives are still gaining traction or are planned to roll out later this year. 
The higher end of our sales outlook reflects a 2.8% 2-year comp in line with the current run rate and implies flat comps for the year, improving from negative 2% in Q1 to relatively flat in Q2 and Q3 to 3% positive by Q4. The lower end of our sales outlook reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year. 
Primarily reflecting our value efforts, we expect a decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, to be greater than last year's 45 basis points decline. While we have identified SG&A improvements of approximately 60 basis points, including the impact of the recent restructuring, we expect these savings to be more than offset by the cost of initiatives to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other cost. Therefore, we expect to decline an operating margin of up to 75 basis points from the 6.1% we recorded last year, excluding charges. 
As we announced today, our board approved an additional $1 billion in stock buyback authority, and our intent is to spend the majority of that in the first half of the year. Excluding an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 per share and net accretion related to these debt-financed buybacks, we expect EPS for the fiscal year of $1.50 or greater. We will be facing our toughest comp and earnings comparisons in the first quarter and estimate approximately a $0.01 per share in costs associated with the current -- recent restructuring. 
I know that we shared a lot of information with you today, but before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we recognize we have our work cut out for us. We believe we're taking the necessary steps to regain our sales momentum, fundamentally evolve our business model and produce the returns that the investment community expects from us and that we expect from ourselves. 
We will now take questions. Our calls will end at 4:45 Central time today. So to allow more time for questions, please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

And we know, in many cases, such as purchasing, we want to take advantage of our scale. We want to -- we have a redundancy built into the system. So the art of what we're trying to do is we want to evolve the structuring in such a way that we take out redundancy and waste, and at the same time though, we're not diminishing the culture, the empowerment efforts that make Whole Foods Market special. And that just means that we have to proceed very thoughtfully, very carefully. And we have to be very inclusive in making the decisions so the voices are heard. That means Whole Foods does move, sometimes can move a little bit slowly, but it means oftentimes, we'll make better decisions because of the inclusive nature of it. But it was a good question because we are thinking deeply about it, and I think the fact that we're so conscious of it means that we're less likely to just do something inadvertently to screw it up. We are determined to evolve, so we are going to evolve, but we're going to take our culture with it."

Obviously, at this point, we've grown to be of $16 billion year in sales. All those functions have evolved over time, as you see in different ways and in different regions. And so I think the company as a whole has come to a place now recognizing that there some of those things that don't need to be done in that way anymore that are best done together in one way and then still identifying clearly those areas where they're close to the customer, where the innovation and where the freedom remains, if that makes a lot of sense to do. So that's the nature of the conversation. So an answer to your answer, we're looking at TMS HR, we're looking at marketing, we're looking at purchasing. We actually have a very evolved plan for -- exactly how purchasing is going to unfold.

It's really in the center store where we're looking at doing a lot more -- bringing a lot more responsibility for centers to our products at global, the global team.

I mean, retail ultimately always comes down to how satisfied the customer is. So it's about retail is detail. It's a cliché, and it's a very appropriate one. Things like the level of customer service, the level of in-stocks that we have in our products, how the stores look, the overall feeling they have when they're in the stores, the cleanliness of the stores, everything that has to do with upgrading the customer experience, from signage to the way we communicate, the messages to how the prepared foods taste. It's making sure that we're executing operationally at a very high standard, so that's what I mean by getting back to basics. That doesn't conflict with our need to evolve and to introduce a bunch of -- all these new initiatives and to evolve our business model. And I think they're -- those are -- they're complementary to each other, but they have to be on the foundation of very strong operations. I mean, it's ultimately satisfied customers who are your best form of advertising that you have. They're the ones that tell their friends. The loyal customer comes back every week, and their basket size is going up. I'm not going to say Whole Foods neglected that. I don't think we've neglected it, but I think we need to up our game. We're going to get better at it."

How can we make this work simpler so that the worker really focusing on the customers and each other and can continue to happen in a more efficient and productive way? And I think that's the effort of the overall looking at the business. And I think the second thing is using technology. Because clearly, these investments, these 3 platform decisions we've made, whether it's Workday on the TMS or HR side, the one POS on the front end side and then also on the Infor on the supply and merchandising side, all 3 of those things are going to make work a lot easier to do with more transparency. They're going to be ultimately supportive of having the team members be able to focus on the customer experience and the work happen more efficiently. So it's sort of combining the future ideas with the core, as John said. And third, I think we all know now that the door of the store is not just a physical, it's also a digital door. And we've got work to do to take that same in-store experience that we have created so well over the years and take that and extend it and -- onto the digital platforms where our customers come. We have 6 million visitors a month to our website. That's a pretty high number for a supermarket and relative to our -- and I think -- so we have opportunities to convert those and continue to build trips through that, so essentially, extending our experience in having a digital door to Whole Foods as well as a physical store."

That's another good question because that's something we're continually talking about and strategizing about and evolving our position on it. But first thing I would say is that a lot of the folks that are copying Whole Foods at this point, they're not copying our quality standards. They're copying our look and feel and our marketing. And so far, it's a good strategy. It's working. Many customers are not looking [indiscernible]. They're not seeing the differences. So one of the challenges Whole Foods has to do better job at is communicating our superior quality, the differentiation. It's there. It's definitely there in the perishables from our animal welfare system and meat, to our sustainable seafood, to our responsibly-grown produce. So we have to do a better job of connecting to our customers to get them to understand that these are not the same things. They may look like they're the same, but they're not. And we don't want to have a race to the bottom. We don't want to compromise our quality and start cutting our quality to make us more competitive on price. Sure, if you're on center store, and these -- and if they have exactly the same items, then we are -- you're absolutely right. We have to be price relevant. We have to be very close or matched on those items, and we're working on that. So it's simultaneously, we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation and where we have price or thumbs were out of line, it is not appropriate. We have to be more competitive in those areas, and we are determined to do so."

We just have a lot more running room. Stores are less congested. It's just easier to do. And while we do think we can increase our comps and we do think we can increase our sales per square foot. It's just our success has become just a higher hurdle for us to jump over. And if you're starting in a lower base as many of our competitors are, it's easy to show a higher comp number. The question is, can you continue to show it? I mean, we showed 8%, 9% comps for 20 consecutive years, just about. So our challenge, and it's a big challenge, is what I started out by saying we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation so the customers understand our quality superiority. And at the same time, we're -- there are no significant differentiating advantages. There is no quality standard differential. Well, a, that's a challenge to differentiate and up the quality standard. But in many cases, it means being more price relevant.

I will briefly review the quarter, focusing most of my time today on the steps we're taking to communicate our differentiation, improve our value perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
In Q4, our sales increased 6% to a record $3.4 billion. We opened 10 stores, expanding our reach to 431 stores across 42 states and 3 countries. After appearing to stabilize early in the quarter, our comps moderated over the last 9 weeks, driven by changes in both traffic and basket size. 
Our EPS miss was driven in large part by weaker-than-anticipated sales. However, we still delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 8% and healthy cash flow from operations of $132 million and our seasonally slowest sales quarter of the year. 
In the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still. As highlighted in our press release, we made measurable progress on many of our strategic initiatives over the past year including using technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
For the fiscal year, we produced industry-leading sales per gross square foot of $970, over $1.3 billion in EBITDA, a record $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and a 15% return on invested capital. Through our strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, we self-funded our new store development and strategic growth initiatives while returning close to $700 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the year with approximately $582 million in cash and investments. 
Whole Foods Market has been a driving force in elevating food consciousness and raising the bar on quality standards for 35-plus years. We have a proven track record of delivering long-term shareholder value, and our tremendous success has bred increased competition. Our partners at United Natural Foods estimated over 70,000 new points of retail for natural and organic products over the last 3 years. 
In this dynamic and increasingly competitive marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper in creating a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. Later, I will outline the decisive steps we are taking to enrich the customer experience and gain efficiencies on our overall cost structure. 
Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation, but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Some would say increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters. The reality is Whole Foods Market sells the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry, and our selection and in-store experience cannot be matched by the competition. Yes, we're going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, selection and service. We believe values matter. It is what our customers tell us they love most about us, and we're not going to change that. 
One of the things we're doing is launching 365 by Whole Foods Market, a complementary brand that will broaden our reach to new customers and new markets. Guided by the same industry-leading quality standards, our 365 stores will allow us to address the value-quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. 
There has never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who's growing it. I believe we'll look back on 2015 and recognize it as the tipping point of a food revelation -- revolution in this country about the direct connection between what you eat, your health and well-being. 
At the same time, food retailing is rapidly evolving in new ways from online delivery in 1 hour to click and collect, to personal shoppers. Some now estimate online sales could grow from 2.5% of total food retail sales to 8% or $100 billion by year 2025. Going forward, we envision a fusion of the store experience and technology with the customer at the center. 
No one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We will keep innovating and creating environments where people can connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of a differentiated customer experience, continuing to raise the bar on quality and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience. 
As the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods is awakening and the ways in which people want to buy their food evolve, the market opportunity is continuing to expand. There will be more than one winner. It is not a zero-sum game. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever, and where our company is today is just a fraction of where we think we'll be 20 years from now. 
As I highlighted earlier, while we're making progress on many of our initiatives, in this dynamic marketplace, we recognize we need to move faster and go deeper to rebuild traffic and sales and create a solid foundation for our long-term profitable growth. These are the steps we are taking to communicate our differentiation and prove our price perception and fundamentally evolve our business. 
One, we are committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business and have already taking steps in this direction. We have a plan to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We are systematically looking at every aspect of our business to eliminate cost that do not produce value for our customers. We recently eliminated more than 2,000 positions, are transforming our purchasing operations to allow us to function more productively, to be more competitive and better leverage our growing size and scale, and are looking for similar opportunities in other key areas. We have also introduced a new labor scheduling tool to our customer service teams with plans to expand to additional teams over the next year. 
Number two, we will innovate faster to further differentiate the Whole Foods Market shopping experience with a focus on our Exclusive Brands and prepared foods. We are operating some of the highest volume restaurants in the country, and no house brand comes close to the quality standards of our Exclusive Brand products. Totaling close to $5 billion or 1/3 of our sales, our Exclusive Brands and prepared foods are key differentiators for us, and we plan to partner with our suppliers to widen our competitive advantage in these areas. As part of this initiative, we have created a new Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality position, which we expect to fill in the next -- in the coming months. 
Number three, we will improve our value perception through increased promotional activity and selective and strategic price reductions. We will utilize new talent, tools and systems as well as consumer insights, benchmarks and KPI progress reporting to better track how our promotions and investments resonate with customers and impact our results. 
Number four, we will support our differentiation and value strategies through enhanced external marketing efforts. We will use media to support our pricing efforts across all major markets, clearly communicating not only our pricing investments but our quality as well. We will holistically address the way in which we communicate our value and values to our customers at every touch point, including our online, digital and social platforms. 
Number five, we will invest in digital strategies to convert the strong traffic we generate online into sales. We have integrated Instacart into our app, we'll soon launch a national sales flyer, and we'll continue to make upgrades to provide more functionality and streamline our customers' digital experience. We have been very pleased with our Affinity pilot in terms of the information we were gathering and the sales lift it is generating. We are committed to the program and have plans for tests in additional markets to further enhance the customer experience and refine the economics before rolling it out nationally. 
Number six, we will invest in our technology platforms to provide a better shopping experience and enable us to run our business more efficiently. We will replace our disparate core legacy platforms with unified, scalable solutions. The roll out of one POS system to all U.S. stores by the end of calendar 2016 will provide faster checkout times, improved labor productivity and better data visibility across all channels. In addition, it will enable us to provide personalized offers and new experiences at checkout via our mobile app. We also just launched our groundbreaking partnership with Infor to co-create a next-generation cloud-based retail merchandising and supply chain management platform. Admittedly behind in this area, this new retail platform will be unlike anything available today and will bring us many new capabilities such as perpetual inventory, replenishment, retail space planning and price optimization. 
Number seven, we will launch our second growth vehicle, 365 by Whole Foods Market. With 8 leases signed to date, we plan to open 3 stores in fiscal year 2016 and up to 10 stores in fiscal year 2017. The time is right to take the high-quality standards we have developed over the last 35-plus years and make them more broadly accessible through a streamlined, value-focused format and serve communities we would not be able to reach with our larger Whole Foods Market stores. 
Number eight, while we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we will increase our square footage in a more moderate pace this year. Having consecutively accelerated store openings over the past 6 years, we plan to grow our square footage at a more moderate pace in fiscal year 2016. We will lessen -- which will lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our comps and allow us to focus on the other areas we have outlined. 
Number nine, we will continue to affirm our culture. Our 91,000 team members are the heart and soul of our company and the not-so-secret ingredient in creating our customer experience. We believe our full-time ratio is among the highest, and our turnover is among the lowest in the industry. We will continue to invest in our team members' development and growth including creating thousands of new jobs over the coming year. 
I will now turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2016, which reflects the impact of these initiatives. We remain focused on the metrics we believe are key to the long-term health of our business and for this fiscal year we are targeting: sales growth of  3% to 5%; approximately 30 new stores, including 2 to 3 relocations and 3 365 stores; square footage growth of 7% or greater; EBITDA margin of approximately 8.5%; CapEx of approximately 5% of sales; and an ROIC greater than 13.5%. 
Our results are highly dependent on comps, which have been particularly difficult to predict in this competitive landscape. While we have seen some stabilization in our 2-year comp trends since the end of the fourth quarter, it has only been 5 weeks. We're hopeful that our comps will improve over the course of the year given our toughest comparisons is in the first quarter, and many of our sales building initiatives are still gaining traction or are planned to roll out later this year. 
The higher end of our sales outlook reflects a 2.8% 2-year comp, in line with the current run rate and implies flat comps for the year, improving from negative 2% in Q1 to relatively flat in Q2 and Q3 to 3% positive by Q4. The lower end of our sales outlook reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year. 
Primarily reflecting our value efforts, we expect the decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, to be greater than last year's 45 basis points decline. While we have identified SG&A improvements of approximately 60 basis points, including the impact from the recent restructuring, we expect these savings to be more than offset by the cost of initiatives to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other cost. Therefore, we expect to decline an operating margin of up to 75 basis points from the 6.1% we recorded last year, excluding charges. 
As we announced today, our board approved an additional $1 billion in stock buyback authority, and our intent is to spend the majority of that in the first half of the year. Excluding an estimated $0.05 to $0.07 per share and net accretion related to these debt-financed buybacks, we expect EPS for the fiscal year of $1.50 or greater. We will be facing our toughest comp and earnings comparisons in the first quarter and estimate approximately a $0.01 per share in costs associated with the current -- the recent restructuring. 
I know that we've shared a lot of information with you today, but before we open it up for questions, I want to underscore that we recognize we have our work cut out for us. We believe we're taking the necessary steps to regain our sales momentum, fundamentally evolve our business model and produce the returns that the investment community expects from us and that we expect from ourselves. 
We will now take questions. Our calls will end at 4:45 Central time today. So to allow more time for questions, please limit yourself to one question at a time so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Thank you."

So the art of what we're trying to do is we want to evolve the structuring in such a way that we take out redundancy and waste, and at the same time though, we're not diminishing the culture, the empowerment efforts that make Whole Foods Market special. And that just means we have to proceed very thoughtfully, very carefully. And we have to be very inclusive in making the decisions so the voices are heard. That means Whole Foods does move, sometimes can move a little bit slowly, but it means oftentimes, we'll make better decisions because of the inclusive nature of it. But it was a good question because we are thinking deeply about it. And I think the fact that we're so conscious of it means that we're less likely to just do something inadvertently to screw it up. We are determined to evolve, so we are going to evolve, but we're going to take our culture with it."

So that's the nature of the conversation. So in answer to your answer, we're looking at TMS HR, we're looking at marketing, we're looking at purchasing.

It's really in the center store where we're looking at doing a lot more -- bringing a lot more responsibility for center store products to global -- the global team. Why that makes sense is that there's -- we worked with our very large center store suppliers, and we feel like we can most efficiently work with them and get the best -- have the best partnership with them at the global level.

We're still going to have the regional folks very involved in those decisions, but we think that we can -- by improving our overall functionality in that area, we think that we can come to a lot better decisions that really work across the company."

I mean, retail ultimately always comes down to how satisfied the customer is. So it's about retail is detail is a cliché, and it's a very appropriate one. Things like the level of customer service, the level of in-stocks that we have in our products, how the stores look, the overall feeling they have when they're in the stores, the cleanliness of the stores, everything that has to do with upgrading the customer experience, from signage to the way we communicate the messages to how the prepared foods taste. It's making sure that we're executing operationally at a very high standard, so that's what I mean by getting back to basics. That doesn't conflict with our need to evolve and to introduce a bunch of -- all these new initiatives and to evolve our business model. I think they're -- those are  complementary to each other, but they have to be on the foundation of very strong operations. I mean, it's ultimately satisfied customers who are your best form of advertising that you have. They're the ones that tell their friends, the loyal customer who comes back every week and their basket size is going up. I'm not going to say Whole Foods neglected that. I don't think we've neglected it, but I think we need to up our game. We're going to get better at it."

So that is the structure, jobs, that is the processes we used, the redundancies that might exist. And you say to yourself, ""How can we do this work? How can we make this work simpler so that the worker really focusing on the customers and each other can continue to happen in a more efficient and productive way?"" And I think that's the effort of the overall looking at the business. And I think the second thing is using technology. Because clearly, these investments, these 3 platform decisions we've made, whether it's Workday on the TMS or HR side, the one POS on the front end side and then also the Infor on the supply and merchandising side, all 3 of those things are going to make work a lot easier to do with more transparency. They're going to be ultimately supportive of having the team members be able to focus on the customer experience and the work happen more efficiently. So it's sort of combining the future ideas with the core, as John said. And third, I think we all know now that the door of the store is not just the physical, it's also the digital door. And we've got work to do to take that same in-store experience that we have created so well over the years and take that and extend it and -- onto the digital platforms where our customers come. We have 6 million visitors a month to our website. That's a pretty high number for a supermarket and relative to our -- and I think -- so we have opportunities to convert those and continue to build trips through that, so essentially, extending our experience in having a digital door to Whole Foods as well as a physical store."

And I guess, if you look at the industry, someone like Kroger has proven over time with Walmart that you don't need to be in line with competition from a pricing standpoint to reach an equilibrium in total value.

That's another good question because that's something we're continually talking about and strategizing about and evolving our position on it. But first thing I would say is that a lot of the folks that are copying Whole Foods at this point, they're not copying our quality standards. They're copying our look and feel and our marketing. And so far, it's a good strategy. It's working. Many customers are not looking beneath the hood. They're not seeing the differences. So one of the challenges Whole Foods has to do better job at is communicating our superior quality, the differentiation. It's there. It's definitely there in the perishables from our animal welfare system in meat, to our sustainable seafood, to our responsibly grown produce. So we have to do a better job of connecting to our customers to get them to understand that these are not the same things. They may look like they're the same, but they're not. And we don't want to have a race to the bottom. We don't want to compromise our quality and start cutting our quality to make us more competitive on price. Sure, if you're in center store and these -- and if they have exactly the same items, then you're absolutely right, we have to be price relevant. We have to be very close or matched on those items, and we're working on that. So it's simultaneously, we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation. And where we have price sore thumbs, we're out of line and it's not appropriate, we have to be more competitive in those areas, and we are determined to do so."

We are not laying out the chapter and verse exactly where that's happening for competitive reasons, but you can see in the guidance that it reflects the decline in the gross margin reflecting aggressive activity.

We probably expect to move the needle next year, although we have to see exactly what works, how it works, how the customers respond to the particular combination of value and quality.

You just have a lot more running room. Stores are less congested. It's just easier to do. And while we do think we can increase our comps and we do think we can increase our sales per square foot, it's just our success has become -- it's just a higher hurdle for us to jump over. And if you're starting in a lower base as many of our competitors are, it's easy to show a higher comp number. The question is, can you continue to show it? I mean, we showed 8%, 9% comps for 20 consecutive years, just about. So our challenge, and it's a big challenge, is what I started out by saying we have to do a better job of communicating our differentiation so the customers understand our quality superiority. And at the same time, where there are no significant differentiating advantages, there is no quality standard differential. Well, a, that's a challenge to differentiate and up the quality standard. But in many cases, it means being more price relevant. And those are the 2 things we intend to do a better job at both of them going forward."
