I'm delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper.First, let's talk about what we've accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We",1235,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. I'm delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper.
First, let's talk about what we've accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We made major strides having implemented a series of initiatives designed to streamline our organization, reduce our cost structure, improve our balance sheet, return capital to our shareholders and drive long-term profitable growth in a challenging revenue environment.
In many areas, we exceeded our commitment by working in a more efficient manner with greater accountability and customer connectedness. And while we achieved much in 2014, I recognize that there is still more we can do to realize the full potential of our company. Rest assured, we are moving with urgency. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place in the industry and inside Juniper and we believe that our best days are still ahead.
To that end, let me share with you what I've been up to in my first few months as CEO. I've spent considerable time talking and listening to our customers, our partners and our employees. Working with the senior leadership team, I set up key execution initiatives for 2015 aligned with our R&D and go-to-market strategy in the areas of Routing, Switching and Security for both Service Provider and Enterprise customers.
I appointed Jonathan Davidson as head of Juniper's Development and Innovation or JDI, to ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted focus on our product roadmap. Jonathan is an accomplished leader and technologist who knows how to bring focus and clarity to developing the innovative products our customers require.
I move network automation project that have graduated out of the incubation space from the office of the CTO to JDI to ensure tighter alignment with the rest of our portfolio and end-to-end solution development. And I oversaw a comprehensive review of the security components of our business, including our capabilities and product roadmap.
While my new role at Juniper now has the added dimension of ensuring that our business performed across a range of network, I will, as I always have, strive to ensure we build and deliver great products that advance the state-of-the-art and network innovation and drive long-term growth for the company.
I'll spend some time now articulating our strategy, how we plan to execute against our vision and our 2015 initiatives.
First, our strategy. We will deliver the most scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks while revolutionizing their agility, efficiency and value through automation. We will focus on customers and partners across our key vertical who view these network attributes as fundamental to their businesses. Product and solution differentiation, with a relentless customer focus, will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenues faster than the market.
Second, on execution. Our innovation engine is running stronger than ever and we are executing on a compelling product roadmap that will drive future growth across Routing, Switching and Security. I'm very excited about our product pipeline, which has never been better and will offer our customers breakthrough performance and impressive capabilities unmatched in the industry.
In Security, I acknowledged that it has underperformed and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. 2015 will be a year of stabilizing our Security revenue. To win in Security, we are pivoting our strategy to building integrated solutions that focus on network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus and Service Provider mobile infrastructure. To emphasize, we are focusing on areas where we can compete effectively and I'm confident that we will do just that.
And importantly, we will be employing a high levered development strategy that takes advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation within Juniper.
Our common thread through all of this is our Junos Space SRS platform, which is adaptable to serve all of these environment and cannot comment at the security needs of any number of different new cases. With this new strategy in effect, we will deliver substantial enhancements to the SRS platform in 2015 and they will be closely intertwined with the network. We believe this new approach will allow us to deliver superior offering and you have an energized team focused on helping our customers get in front of their security challenges.
Our exciting product portfolio, along with our focused go-to-market model, are coming together to create real competitive advantage for our customers. We have a sound strategy in place, we are executing well against our plan and we continue to make progress with new design wins and diversification of our business across our target verticals and geographies.
I'd like to turn now to the macro environment and our business. I'm confident in Juniper's future and I see substantial opportunities to grow and deliver value over the long term. In the near term, we continue to face headwinds in U.S. carrier spending, however, we do expect improvement in spending in the latter half of this year. We have signaled in July of 2014 that the market was going to be challenging and we ran our business under the assumption that it would be so for the full 4 quarter cycle that we've historically seen.
Based on recent conversations with our customers, we still expect that to be the case with a return to growth in investments in the second half of this year. Although 2014 Routing revenue declined 4%, the diversity of our business helped offset the decline from U.S. carriers. We continue to see growth in Routing from cloud providers, cable, financial services and strategic enterprise customers that are building and operating their own network infrastructure.
In Switching, we are just at the early stages of an exciting journey of growth. There will be more to come from me over time on this topic as we take a leap in performance and automation in the data center switching space.
Let me now set expectations moving forward. While we navigate industry and customer dynamics in the near term, we have continued to focus on things that matter most to our customers and our shareholders. There are no changes to our planning assumption. Juniper remains committed to the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day last October, where we stated an overall growth rate of 3% to 6% over the next 3 years.
We are continuing to manage the business prudently. We maintain our stated non-GAAP OpEx target of $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million. We are also committed to continuing the aggressive capital return plan that we have been executing against.
To summarize, our team remains steadfast. We will drive profitable growth and develop and deliver the innovative IP networking products and solutions that our customers rely on. We will continue to be intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiative. I will be monitoring our business closely and will report on our progress quarterly.
In closing, I thank our employees for their resiliencies through a year of much change. Juniper employees around the world continue to focus on executing as One-Juniper and I'm proud of and grateful for their dedication. I also appreciate the continued support of our shareholders, partners and customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details of our financial results and our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015."
30439,281088561,749557,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases as well as give you the context for the goodwill impairment charge.We have completed the restruc",1773,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases as well as give you the context for the goodwill impairment charge.
We have completed the restructuring actions that we first announced in February of 2014. In Q4, we exceeded our expense reduction commitment and implemented the additional structural actions to achieve the $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million, OpEx target for 2015. As Rami mentioned, one of the actions we completed during the quarter was to tighten the focus of our security portfolio, allowing us to dedicate our security resources to the SRX platform.
Total restructuring and asset write-down charges for Q4 were approximately $29 million and for the full year 2014 were $209 million. We also finalized the sale of Junos Pulse and recorded a $20 million net gain. We are executing very well on our capital return plan. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in December and repurchased $500 million of shares in Q4.
For 2014, we have returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders and we are reaffirming our commitment to return a total of $4.1 billion to our shareholders through 2016.
Overall, I am very pleased with our cost structure and the progress that we've made towards achieving the capital return commitments we made to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to address the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in Q4. As required under GAAP accounting rules, pro forma regular review of the carrying value of goodwill. During Q4, this review resulted in an estimated noncash impairment charge of $850 million related to the goodwill of our security reporting unit. There are several factors which contributed to this impairment, including the recent underperformance of this reporting unit and our efforts to refocus our security offerings in addition to the divestitures of Junos Pulse.
Combined, these factors result in a delay in achieving revenue and profit forecast made to support the historical Security goodwill valuation. I want to remind everyone that this accounting charge has no direct effect on Juniper's cash balance, operating cash flow or business outlook. We remain committed to the long-term growth target that we outlined at our October investor meeting.
Now let's return to an analysis of the Q4 results. As a reminder, the following revenue commentary and growth rates have been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse.
Overall, revenue and demand for the fourth quarter was better than we expected. However, the same that we've discussed over the last 6 months remain consistent. That is large U.S. carrier demand continues to be weak, but has been somewhat offset by healthy demand from cloud providers and cable customers, pockets of momentum in EMEA and APAC Service Providers and improving enterprise demand.
Looking at our demand metrics, product book-to-bill was much greater than 1. We exited 2014 with about $445 million in product backlog. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,102,000,000, down 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Product revenue was $794 million, down 17% from last year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Services revenue was $308 million, up 8% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.41. Excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.03, non-GAAP diluted earnings would have been down $0.05 per share year-over-year and up $0.02 sequentially.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by the cost reductions and the positive impact of $0.06 from the reduced share count. The sequential increase was largely driven by improvements in our cost structure.
For the quarter, GAAP loss per share was $1.81, which includes the $850 million impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.19 [ph]. Included in this result is a $0.07 impact for restructuring and other charges and a $0.04 benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 benefit from the gain of the sale of Junos Pulse.
Now let's look at revenue results in detail by product area. Routing product revenue was $523 million, down 15% year-over-year and a 2% decline from the prior quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by weakness from our large U.S. carriers, partially offset by strength in cloud providers.
Switching product revenue was $174 million, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in Enterprise. Quarter-over-quarter, Switching product revenue increased 13%, driven by demand from cloud providers and financial services for our QFX products.
Security product revenue was $97 million, down [ph] a disappointing 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The decrease was due to a decline in the SRX platform from U.S. carrier customers as well as the continued decline from ScreenOS products.
Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 64.1% compared to 64.2% a year ago and the elevated level of 65.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins was 64.3%, down 0.6 [ph] point from a year ago and 1.8 points from last quarter. The expected sequential decline was primarily attributable to a shift in product and geography mix. 
Non-GAAP services gross margins were 63.6%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and 0.6 [ph] point quarter-over-quarter. This increase was due to lower support related costs from operational improvements and variable cost savings.
We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $465 million, below our guidance range, and down $74 million or 14% year-over-year. This reflects the implementation of the addition cost-saving commitment announced on our Q3 2014 Earnings Call as well as the significant benefit from the reduction in variable expenses in the quarter.
Our headcount ended the year at 8,806, a decline of 677 employees or 7% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 21.9%, flat year-over-year despite lower revenue. This is due for significant focus on cost reduction efforts. The non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, down 6.1 points from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $13 million onetime benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014.
The GAAP tax expense in the quarter was $75 million on a GAAP loss of $694 million, resulting in a negative tax rate of 11%.
The GAAP loss is due to the goodwill impairment charge, which is a nondeductible tax item. The GAAP tax rate this quarter was also impacted by the gain on the sale of Junos Pulse.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2014 full year results. Total revenue was $4,532,000,000, approximately flat from last year. For the full year, large U.S. carrier revenues declined, offset by an increase from cloud providers and cable and a steady performance from Enterprise. While we're not happy with the overall result, we are successfully achieving diversification of our customer base and increasing the relevance of our products across multiple customer segments.
Routing product revenue finished the year down 4%, primarily due to the softness from U.S. carriers in the second half. Switching product revenue was up 13% for the full year, driven by growth from cloud providers. Security product revenue was down 14% for the full year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the legacy ScreenOS products.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 64.3% for the full year, approximately flat with 2013. This is a good result and represents the value our customers seen in innovation as well as our intense focus on supply chain cost reductions. The benefits of which offset both revenue mix changes and the normal levels of pricing pressure.
I'm pleased with the improvement in our overall cost structure. We ended the year with $2,015,000,000 of non-GAAP operating expenses, down $88 million or 4% from 2013. This decrease in the OpEx allowed us to extend non-GAAP operating margins by 1.5 points to end the full year at 20.7% despite the challenging revenue environment.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.45, up $0.17 or 13% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to a positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from a reduction in share count of 9% year-over-year as well as significantly lower operating expenses for the full year. 
GAAP loss per share was $0.73, which includes the impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11, inclusive of a $0.45 impact to restructuring and other charges.
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of net cash and investments. The decline from Q3 was primarily due to the capital return of $542 million in the quarter. For the quarter, we generated good operating cash flow of $291 million and $763 million for the full year. DSO was 49 days, which is flat from last quarter. During 2014, in order to structure our channel business and reduce our expenses, we transitioned some of our distributable financing to Juniper's balance sheet to a targeted financial services program to certain partners. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in the range of 45 to 55 days.
Now I will provide an outlook for Q1 of 2015. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We continue to expect the demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers to be challenging throughout the first half of 2015. As we've said, we are 2 quarters into what we expect to be a 4 quarter cycle. And as a result, we remain cautious in our revenue planning assumptions.
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenue to range from $1,020,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be 63.5%, plus or minus 0.5%, at the lower end of our long-term range due to the lower volume.
Operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, plus or minus $5 million. And as a reminder, our Q4 2014 results included a significant benefit of variable cost savings. We remain focused on our cost structure and we are committed to managing expenses throughout 2015.
Operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% at the midpoint of guidance and we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 27% to the first quarter, assuming no extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015. 
We expect diluted earnings per share of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 420 million. I am also pleased to report that the board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.

So let me just address your first question, which is around the Service Provider outlook primarily here in the United States. There are a number of factors that we look at. Obviously, we talk to our customers and we engaged with them very closely. Number one would be things around the timing of projects that we've been working with them on. We're looking at Augustine macro trends that are happening around the M&A activity, the investment split between wireline and wireless that are large Service Provider customers are currently expecting to undertake, spectrum auctions. All of these have contributed to our Juniper Networks but it makes for us at this point to maintain our prudent outlook looking forward and manage our business accordingly. Now that said, we are engaging with them on an ongoing basis. And based on that investment, the timing of projects and so forth, we do anticipate that their investment levels will start to recover in the second half of this year. On your second question, which is more around the Geo profile for Service Providers and maybe more broadly speaking, let me just touch on the Juniper business as it pertains to our performance across the globe. And I'll touch on it more from a service provider standpoint, because I believe that's what you're interested in just from your question. In EMEA, I'm actually pleased with our performance and the momentum that we're seeing both in the smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 Service Providers that have really adopted a number of our products, especially our MX and PTX products as they build out convergence and structures. We're actually seeing some good momentum in the quarter as well in the Q4 time frame. And in APAC, there is a bit more of a complex answer, because I think the situation in places like China is somewhat different than that outside of China. In China, we have to be very laser focused on opportunities that we believe we actually have a good chance of winning and it's very much a partner-led model in doing so and that can result in some lumpiness. Now we actually had some good sequential performance in China in Q4, but generally speaking, as I said, that could be lumpy. More broadly speaking outside of China, as you look at South Asia, for example, there based on the number of wins that we've had historically and ongoing projects that we're working, we're actually doing quite well and I'm 9 pleased with our performance there. And I expect that to continue throughout this year in 2015."

So that all remains absolutely intact and we're executing towards that. There are changes or twists to the strategy as it pertains to security. I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks upfront, but just to reiterate, we're pivoting away from thinking about security from a standpoint of point products. We're moving much more towards integrated solutions across Switching, Routing and Security to address the main level problems that are customers want from us and we're executing on a very high leveraged strategy in engineering across switching, revenue and security. I'll just say that there are tremendous assets across silicon and routing or I should say silicon and software that have largely gone untapped for security. And we have this incredible opportunity as a part, as a function of this new strategy to leverage these assets to give us relatively quick gains in the performance scale and capabilities of our security products and that's exactly what we're going to be executing on now."

Let me start with Switching and Security, then I'll pass it over to Robyn for your last question. On the switching side, I think you need to keep in mind that around 2, 2.5 years ago, we took a step back and under -- and we set up a new strategy in switching where we took a lot of lessons that we had learned from the first set of products that we introduced into the market and the road map that we are now executing towards. So if you look at what we just announced last year, our QFX Q100 [ph] products, our OCX 1100 products, which is essentially a Junos Space white box switch, these are just the beginnings of what I would consider a very compelling product roadmap that our customers are going to best respond very well to in switching. And I have alluded to in the past and I'll just reiterate again that we will continue the rolling thunder, if you will, of new products in switching this year that will contribute to the momentum that we expect.
Now there are 2 dimensions to our Switching business. There are of course, the enterprise and the Service Provider. Service Provider, as I mentioned, has always been somewhat lumpy and as a result of that, protecting the ups and downs is not going to be all that easy but I expect to continue to take market share in switching as a result of our go-to-market focus and our product strategy.
In Security, I can't really get into the timing, although you'll find out when we make the public announcements. I will just say that I'm very excited and encouraged by what the team has accomplished thus far. And just to give you a clue, because it is a high leveraged strategy, it does not involve a large amount of time where essentially leveraging technologies that we have already developed in the company but now packaging them up and testing them in a way that they contribute to our security capabilities and they will be capabilities from the standpoint of performance, scale and our ability to detect and stop threat faster than the competition."

Of course, we're understanding traffic patterns and flows through switches and routers actually allows you to improve your security posture substantially overall when you look at a domain like the data center cloud or the Service Provider edge. So that's effectively the strategy that we're going to be executing towards. It does involve building security products and they're going to be very effective security products but those products are going to be very much integrated, if you will, solutions standpoint to Switching and Routing. They're going to be tested together and there will be a very high leveraging of technology components between silicon and software across 3 of these product lines. So think of it from the standpoint of lots of cost synergies from the leveraging of technology as well as revenue synergies. Very commensurate with what I believe the industry is heading towards and how they think about the combinations of these products. Robyn?"

First is the NetScreen products or the ScreenOS products that have been in decline or continue to be decline, fairly rapid decline in fact, it now represents a relatively smaller fraction of our overall Security business. The SRX products, there is a high-end and the low-end component and especially the high-end component does have a sort of a lumpiness to it because it relies on large deals and typically there are service provider deals around the world.

But I think the overarching message that I want to get across on this call is that I'm not least were satisfied with the performance of our Security business. I think we can and will do better and this is a competitive space and we have to operate and innovate under that assumption and that requires that we take a much more focused approach ensuring that these products, the ones that you're asking about, the high -- the Junos Pulse products are going to be incredibly competitive against everybody else in the industry, especially as it pertains to integrated solutions in Security and Routing and that's exactly what we're going to be focused.

And there are, in fact, synergies there with Routing and so this back-to-basics approach that I have just described where I can leverage some of the silicon enhancements that I have already funded, that I've already invested in to improve my Routing and switching could be used very effectively and securities can be done.

If you look at Juniper's Routing business overall because vMX is in fact router, just has to be a virtualized router. We make the bulk of our revenue in the high performance end of that range. i.e., the larger systems are the systems that sell the most just by virtue of the applications and the used cases that we are solving for our customers. There is a -- there is also a market out there for low-end routers. It's market that we are not as penetrated in today. It is a market where this trend of virtualization will, in fact, impact first because virtualization, i.e. this movement of services in the case of virtual MX, it's a Layer 3 Routing service onto a virtual machine that fits standard servers is interesting in some in the -- in its ability to deliver tragedy to our customers but it certainly cannot keep up with the performance that our customers require for the high-end application where we already are very well penetrated today. So the net of what I just said is that the virtual MX represents a good opportunity for Juniper to go after the low-end routing environment and used cases for our customers. So where our customers are thinking about deploying small PE router that the service provider edge, they now might consider using a virtual MX software license downloaded off of our website and deployed on a standardized server. That's a revenue opportunity for Juniper. And of course a profit opportunity for Juniper. So it's highly complementary with the rest of our portfolio. Its still -- I don't also want to set some expectations because the market is still in its early stages here. This is a developing market but in developing and shipping these products, we're essentially sending the message and putting a stake in the ground for our customers that we want to participate in this emerging market with really compelling feature-rich products.

Sure. Certainly, you picked up on something that's very important, which is that -- and you see this in our Q4 results in fact, which is that we have offset some of the weakness in the large U.S. service provider by diversifying our business across a number of key verticals, including cloud providers and cable. That is by design. That is very much a function of our strategy. And I think that's a very healthy thing to do and we will continue to do just that. So whereas we anticipate a recovery in spending by our large service provider customers in the second half, we certainly are not counting completely on that. We're also executing on this high diversification strategy across all of our key verticals, both from a go-to-market service standpoint as well as from the solutions that we're developing for those verticals."

What we saw for the full year of 2014 is that the U.S. large Service Providers were actually down year-over-year and they were offset by growth in cable and content Service Providers. And that was the thing we talked about at the Analyst Day as being an important one, because what it does is it shows not only the day diversification of the revenue but also the applicability, the technology and the solutions that we're developing across multiple customer segments. And that includes the enterprise because enterprise for the full year was pretty steady. It was actually from a -- it was a good performance for enterprise for the year.

I'm delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper.First, let's talk about what we've accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We",1234,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. I'm delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper.
First, let's talk about what we've accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We made major strides having implemented a series of initiatives designed to streamline our organization, reduce our cost structure, improve our balance sheet, return capital to our shareholders and drive long-term profitable growth in a challenging revenue environment.
In many areas, we exceeded our commitments by working in a more efficient manner with greater accountability and customer connectedness. And while we achieved much in 2014, I recognize that there is still more we can do to realize the full potential of our company. Rest assured, we are moving with urgency. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place in the industry and inside Juniper and we believe that our best days are still ahead.
To that end, let me share with you what I've been up to in my first few months as CEO. I spent considerable time talking and listening to our customers, our partners and our employees. Working with the senior leadership team, I set out key execution initiatives for 2015 aligned with our R&D and go-to-market strategy in the areas of Routing, Switching and Security for both Service Provider and Enterprise customers.
I appointed Jonathan Davidson as head of Juniper's Development and Innovation, or JDI, to ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted focus on our product roadmap. Jonathan is an accomplished leader and technologist who knows how to bring focus and clarity to developing the innovative products our customers require.
I moved network automation projects that have graduated out of the incubation phase from the Office of the CTO to JDI to ensure tighter alignment with the rest of our portfolio and end-to-end solution development. And I oversaw a comprehensive review of the security components of our business, including our capabilities and product road map.
While my new role at Juniper now has the added dimension of ensuring that our business performed across a range of metrics, I will, as I always have, strive to ensure we build and deliver great products that advance the state-of-the-art in network innovation and drive long-term growth for the company.
I'll spend some time now articulating our strategy, how we plan to execute against our vision and our 2015 initiatives.
First, our strategy. We will deliver the most scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks while revolutionizing their agility, efficiency and value through automation. We will focus on customers and partners across our key verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their businesses. Product and solution differentiation, with a relentless customer focus, will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market.
Second, on execution. Our innovation engine is running stronger than ever and we are executing on a compelling product roadmap that will drive future growth across Routing, Switching and Security. I'm very excited about our product pipeline, which has never been better, and will offer our customers breakthrough performance and impressive capabilities unmatched in the industry.
In Security, I acknowledged that it has underperformed and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. 2015 will be a year of stabilizing our Security revenue. To win in Security, we are pivoting our strategy to building integrated solutions that focus on network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus and service provider mobile infrastructure. To emphasize, we are focusing on areas where we can compete effectively and I'm confident that we will do just that.
And importantly, we will be employing a high-leveraged development strategy that takes advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation within Juniper.
Our common thread through all of this is our Junos Space SRX platform, which is adaptable to serve all of these environments and can accommodate the security needs of any number of different use cases. With this new strategy in effect, we will be delivering substantial enhancements to the SRX platform in 2015 and they will be closely intertwined with the network. We believe this new approach will allow us to deliver superior offering and we have an energized team focused on helping our customers get in front of their security challenges.
Our exciting product portfolio, along with our focused go-to-market model, are coming together to create real competitive advantage for our customers. We have a sound strategy in place, we are executing well against our plan, and we continue to make progress with new design wins and diversification of our business across our target verticals and geographies.
I'd like to turn now to the macro environment and our business. I'm confident in Juniper's future and I see substantial opportunities to grow and deliver value over the long term. In the near term, we continue to face headwinds in U.S. carrier spending, however, we do expect improvements in spending in the latter half of this year. We had signaled in July of 2014 that the market was going to be challenging and we ran our business under the assumption that it would be so for the full 4-quarter cycle that we'd historically seen.
Based on recent conversations with our customers, we still expect that to be the case with a return to growth in investments in the second half of this year. Although 2014 Routing revenue declined 4%, the diversity of our business helped offset the decline from U.S. carriers. We continued to see growth in Routing from cloud providers, cable, financial services and strategic enterprise customers that are building and operating their own network infrastructure.
In Switching, we are just at the early stages of an exciting journey of growth. There will be more to come from me over time on this topic as we take a leap in performance and automation in the data center switching space.
Let me now set expectations moving forward. While we navigate industry and customer dynamics in the near term, we have continued to focus on things that matter most to our customers and our shareholders. There are no changes to our planning assumptions. Juniper remains committed to the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day last October, where we stated an overall growth rate of 3% to 6% over the next 3 years.
We are continuing to manage the business prudently. We maintain our stated non-GAAP OpEx target of $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million. We are also committed to continuing the aggressive capital return plan that we have been executing against.
To summarize, our team remains steadfast. We will drive profitable growth and develop and deliver the innovative IP networking products and solutions that our customers rely on. We will continue to be intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives. I will be monitoring our business closely and will report on our progress quarterly.
In closing, I thank our employees for their resiliency through a year of much change. Juniper employees around the world continue to focus on executing as One-Juniper and I'm proud of and grateful for their dedication. I also appreciate the continued support of our shareholders, partners and customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details of our financial results and our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015."
30439,281088561,749667,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases as well as give you the context for the goodwill impairment charge.We have completed the restruc",1769,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases as well as give you the context for the goodwill impairment charge.
We have completed the restructuring actions that we first announced in February of 2014. In Q4, we exceeded our expense reduction commitment and implemented the additional structural actions to achieve the $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million, OpEx target for 2015. As Rami mentioned, one of the actions we completed during the quarter was to tighten the focus of our security portfolio, allowing us to dedicate our security resources to the SRX platform.
Total restructuring and asset write-down charges for Q4 were approximately $29 million and for the full year 2014 were $209 million. We also finalized the sale of Junos Pulse and recorded a $20 million net gain. We are executing very well on our capital return plan. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in December and repurchased $500 million of shares in Q4.
For 2014, we have returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders and we are reaffirming our commitment to return a total of $4.1 billion to our shareholders through 2016.
Overall, I am very pleased with our cost structure and the progress that we've made towards achieving the capital return commitments we made to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to address the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in Q4. As required under GAAP accounting rules, we performed a regular review of the carrying value of goodwill. During Q4, this review resulted in an estimated noncash impairment charge of $850 million related to the goodwill of our security reporting unit. There are several factors which contributed to this impairment, including the recent underperformance of this reporting unit and our efforts to refocus our security offerings in addition to the divestitures of Junos Pulse.
Combined, these factors result in a delay in achieving revenue and profit forecasts needed to support the historical Security goodwill valuation. I want to remind everyone that this accounting charge has no direct effect on Juniper's cash balance, operating cash flows or business outlook. We remain committed to the long-term growth target that we outlined at our October investor meeting.
Now let's return to an analysis of the Q4 results. As a reminder, the following revenue commentary and growth rates had been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse.
Overall, revenue and demand for the fourth quarter was better than we expected. However, the themes that we've discussed over the last 6 months remain consistent. That is, large U.S. carrier demand continues to be weak, but has been somewhat offset by healthy demand from cloud providers and cable customers, pockets of momentum in EMEA and APAC service providers, and improving enterprise demand.
Looking at our demand metrics, product book-to-bill was much greater than 1. We exited 2014 with about $445 million in product backlog. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,102,000,000, down 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Product revenue was $794 million, down 17% from last year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Services revenue was $308 million, up 8% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.41. Excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.03, non-GAAP diluted earnings would have been down $0.05 per share year-over-year and up $0.02 sequentially.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by the cost reductions and the positive impact of $0.06 from the reduced share count. The sequential increase was largely driven by improvements in our cost structure.
For the quarter, GAAP loss per share was $1.81, which includes the $850 million impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.19. Included in this result is a $0.07 impact for restructuring and other charges and a $0.04 benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 benefit from the gain of the sale of Junos Pulse.
Now let's look at revenue results in detail by product area. Routing product revenue was $523 million, down 15% year-over-year and a 2% decline from the prior quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by weakness from our large U.S. carriers, partially offset by strength in cloud providers.
Switching product revenue was $174 million, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in Enterprise. Quarter-over-quarter, Switching product revenue increased 13%, driven by demand from cloud providers and financial services for our QFX products.
Security product revenue was $97 million, down a disappointing 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The decrease was due to a decline in the SRX platform from U.S. carrier customers as well as the continued decline from ScreenOS products.
Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 64.1% compared to 64.2% a year ago and the elevated level of 65.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.3%, down 0.6 point from a year ago and 1.8 points from last quarter. The expected sequential decline was primarily attributable to a shift in product and geography mix. 
Non-GAAP services gross margins were 63.6%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and 0.6 point quarter-over-quarter. This increase was due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and variable cost savings.
We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $465 million, below our guidance range, and down $74 million or 14% year-over-year. This reflects the implementation of the additional cost-saving commitment announced on our Q3 2014 earnings call as well as the significant benefit from the reduction in variable expenses in the quarter.
Our headcount ended the year at 8,806, a decline of 677 employees or 7% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 21.9%, flat year-over-year despite lower revenue. This is due to our significant focus on cost reduction efforts. The non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, down 6.1 points from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $13 million onetime benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014.
The GAAP tax expense in the quarter was $75 million on a GAAP loss of $694 million, resulting in a negative tax rate of 11%.
The GAAP loss is due to the goodwill impairment charge, which is a nondeductible tax item. The GAAP tax rate this quarter was also impacted by the gain on the sale of Junos Pulse.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2014 full year results. Total revenue was $4,532,000,000, approximately flat from last year. For the full year, large U.S. carrier revenues declined, offset by an increase from cloud providers and cable, and a steady performance from Enterprise. While we're not happy with the overall result, we are successfully achieving diversification of our customer base and increasing the relevance of our products across multiple customer segments.
Routing product revenue finished the year down 4%, primarily due to the softness from U.S. carriers in the second half. Switching product revenue was up 13% for the full year, driven by growth from cloud providers. Security product revenue was down 14% for the full year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the legacy ScreenOS products.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 64.3% for the full year, approximately flat with 2013. This is a good result and represents the value our customers see in innovation as well as our intense focus on supply chain cost reductions. The benefits of which offset both revenue mix changes and the normal levels of pricing pressure.
I'm pleased with the improvement in our overall cost structure. We ended the year with $2,015,000,000 of non-GAAP operating expenses, down $88 million or 4% from 2013. This decrease in OpEx allowed us to expand non-GAAP operating margins by 1.5 points to end the full year at 20.7% despite the challenging revenue environment.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.45, up $0.17 or 13% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to a positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from a reduction in share count of 9% year-over-year as well as significantly lower operating expenses for the full year. 
GAAP loss per share was $0.73, which includes the impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11, inclusive of the $0.45 impact to restructuring and other charges.
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of net cash and investments. The decline from Q3 was primarily due to the capital return of $542 million in the quarter. For the quarter, we generated good operating cash flow of $291 million and $763 million for the full year. DSO was 49 days, which is flat from last quarter. During 2014, in order to foster our channel business and reduce our expenses, we transitioned some of our distributor financing to Juniper's balance sheet to a targeted financial services program for certain partners. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in the range of 45 to 55 days.
Now I will provide an outlook for Q1 of 2015. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We continue to expect the demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers to be challenging throughout the first half of 2015. As we have said, we are 2 quarters into what we expect to be a 4-quarter cycle. And as a result, we remain cautious in our revenue planning assumptions.
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenue to range from $1,020,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be 63.5%, plus or minus 0.5%, at the lower end of our long-term range due to the lower volume.
Operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, plus or minus $5 million. And as a reminder, our Q4 2014 results included a significant benefit of variable cost savings. We remain focused on our cost structure and we are committed to managing expenses throughout 2015.
Operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% at the midpoint of guidance and we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 27% to the first quarter, assuming no extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015. 
We expect diluted earnings per share of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 420 million. I am also pleased to report that the board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.

So let me just address your first question which is around the Service Provider outlook primarily here in the United States. There are a number of factors that we look at. Obviously, we talk to our customers and we engage with them very closely. Number one would be things around the timing of projects that we've been working with them on. We're looking obviously at macro trends that are happening around M&A activity, the investment split between wireline and wireless that our large Service Provider customers are currently expecting to undertake. Spectrum auctions, all of these have contributed to our assessment that it makes sense for us at this point to maintain our prudent outlook looking forward and manage our business accordingly. Now that said, we are engaging with them on an ongoing basis. And based on that engagement, the timing of projects and so forth, we do anticipate that their investment levels will start to recover in the second half of this year. On your second question, which is more around the geo profile for service providers and maybe more broadly speaking, let me just touch on the Juniper business as it pertains to our performance across the globe. And I'll touch on it more from a service provider standpoint, because I believe that's what you're interested in just from your question. In EMEA, I'm actually pleased with our performance and the momentum that we're seeing both in the smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers that have really adopted a number of our products, especially our MX and PTX products, as they build out converged infrastructures. And we're actually seeing some good momentum in the quarter as well in the Q4 time frame. And in APAC, there is a bit more of a complex answer, because I think the situation in places like China is somewhat different than that outside of China. In China, we have to be very laser focused on opportunities that we believe we actually have a good chance of winning and it's very much a partner-led model in doing so and that can result in some lumpiness. Now we actually had some good sequential performance in China in Q4, but generally speaking, as I said, that could be lumpy. More broadly speaking, outside of China, as you look at South Asia, for example, there, based on the number of wins that we've had historically and ongoing projects that we're working on, we're actually doing quite well and I'm pleased with our performance there. And I expect that to continue throughout this year in 2015."

So first, yes, you're right, you have to keep in mind that I was a part of the leadership team that developed, created that strategy and it's a strategy that I very much believe in. It's a strategy that, from a go-to-market standpoint, is laser focused on key verticals that we believe will value the types of technology and then products that we develop and where we have the maximum chance of success. It's a strategy where, from an R&D standpoint, we're really executing on the performance scale capability that our customers require, but just as importantly, the software-driven innovation around automation, absolutely fundamental. So that all remains absolutely intact and we're executing towards that. There are changes or tweaks to the strategy as it pertains to security. I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks upfront, but just to reiterate, we're pivoting away from thinking about security from a standpoint of point products. We're moving much more towards integrated solutions across Switching, Routing and Security to address domain-level problems that our customers want from us and we're executing on a very high leveraged strategy in engineering across Switching and Routing and Security. I'll just say that there are tremendous assets across silicon and routing, or I should say, silicon and software, that have largely gone untapped for security. And we have this incredible opportunity as a part, as a function of this new strategy to leverage these assets to give us relatively quick gains in the performance scale and capabilities of our security products. And that's exactly what we're going to be executing on now."

And I believe that we are very well positioned with the products that we have and the strategy that we're executing on to set ourselves up to participate in the growth once it resumes. So I can't talk about any specific projects but I can say products like our virtual MX, products like the virtual SRX, or what we call the Firefly, that really represent a new way of service delivery using cloud-based models, are exactly the kind of products that our customers are requesting today and I think set us up -- set ourselves up for success when spending starts to recover."

Let me start with the Switching and Security, then I'll pass it over to Robyn for your last question. On the Switching side, I think you need to keep in mind that around 2, 2.5 years ago, we took a step back and under -- and we set up a new strategy in Switching where we took a lot of lessons that we had learned from the first set of products that we introduced into the market in the road map that we are now executing towards. So if you look at what we just announced last year, our QFX5100 product, our OCX1100 product, which is essentially a Junos Space white box switch, these are just the beginnings of what I would consider a very compelling product road map that our customers are going to best respond very well to in Switching. And I have alluded to in the past, and I'll just reiterate again, that we will continue the rolling thunder, if you will, of new products in Switching this year that will contribute to the momentum that we expect. Now there are 2 dimensions to our Switching business. There is, of course, the Enterprise and the Service Provider. Service Provider, as I mentioned, has always been somewhat lumpy and as a result of that, predicting the ups and downs is not going to be all that easy but I expect to continue to take market share in Switching as a result of our go-to-market focus and our product strategy. In Security, I can't really get into the timing, although you'll find out when we make the public announcement. I will just say that I'm very excited and encouraged by what the team has accomplished thus far. And just to give you a clue, because it is a high-leveraged strategy, it does not involve a large amount of time where essentially leveraging technologies that we have already developed in the company but now packaging them up and testing them in a way that they contribute to our security capabilities and they will be capabilities from the standpoint of performance, scale and our ability to detect and stop threat faster than the competition.

Let me start with the security question first and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. I believe the industry is moving in a direction in which Security is increasingly being intimately tied with Switching and Routing where understanding traffic patterns and flows through switches and routers actually allows you to improve your security posture substantially overall when you look at a domain like the data center cloud or the service provider edge. So that's effectively the strategy that we're going to be executing towards. It does involve building Security products and they're going to be very effective Security products. But those products are going to be very much integrated, if you will, from a solutions standpoint, to Switching and Routing. They're going to be tested together and there will be a very high leveraging of technology components between silicon and software across 3 of these product lines. So think of it from the standpoint of lots of cost synergies from the leveraging of technology as well as revenue synergies very commensurate with what I believe the industry is heading towards and how they think about the combinations of these products.

The SRX products, there is a high-end and the low-end component and especially the high-end component does have a sort of a lumpiness to it because it relies on large deals and typically there are service provider deals around the world. So we did see that impact us to some extent in the Q4 time frame. But I think the overarching message that I want to get across on this call is that I'm not pleased or satisfied with the performance of our Security business. I think we can and will do better. And this is a competitive space and we have to operate and innovate under that assumption and that requires that we take a much more focused approach ensuring that these products, the ones that you're asking about, the high -- the Junos-based products, are going to be incredibly competitive against everybody else in the industry, especially as it pertains to integrated solutions in Security and Routing.

And there are, in fact, synergies there with Routing and so this back-to-basics approach that I have just described where I can leverage some of the silicon enhancements that I have already funded, that I've already invested in to improve my Routing and Switching can be used very effectively and Security can be done.

It is a market where this trend of virtualization will, in fact, impact first because virtualization, i.e., this movement of services, in the case of virtual MX, it's a Layer 3 Routing service on to virtual machines that fit on standard servers, is interesting in some in the -- in its ability to deliver agility to our customers, but it certainly cannot keep up with the performance that our customers require for the high-end applications where we already are very well penetrated today. So the net of what I just said is that the virtual MX represents a great opportunity for Juniper to go after the low-end routing environment and used cases for our customers. So where our customers are thinking about deploying small PE router that the service provider edge, they now might consider using a virtual MX software license downloaded off of our website and deployed on a standard rack server. That's a revenue opportunity for Juniper, and of course a profit opportunity for Juniper. So it's highly complementary with the rest of our portfolio. It's still -- I don't -- I want to also set some expectations because the market is still in its early stages here. This is a developing market. But in developing and shipping these products, we're essentially sending the message and putting a stake in the ground to our customers that we want to participate in this emerging market with really compelling feature-rich products. A product like this is  one that we're -- we have to be proud enough of to put the MX logo on it. And that's essentially what we've done."

So on the cloud and especially as it pertains to the Switching opportunity. If you look at our business today, there -- the bulk of our Switching products sell in to either data center or some combination of data center and campus. And even when you look at the campus dimension of this, it's actually the larger, more mission-critical campuses that we're going after because, quite frankly, it's geared towards customers that care about carrier-class capabilities, performance and scalability that we address very well. So that is how I would look at the business today. Now as we start to introduce some of the new products, certainly we'll have an opportunity to go deeper into these existing opportunities in the enterprise for data center and mission-critical campus but we'll also open up new opportunities in the cloud providers and financial services in particular. That's how I would characterize where we are today and the opportunity going forward. I'll just touch very briefly on the second question which is -- yes, I mean, you're right. Even if we introduce new products this year, there is the typical certification and qualification cycle that can take a quarter to a -- I should say a few quarters by our customers. Enterprise customers will typically make that more in the lower end of the range, maybe a quarter to 2 quarters. Service provider customers could take 9 months to a year of certification."

What we saw for the full year of 2014 is that the U.S. large service providers were actually down year-over-year and they were offset by growth in cable and content service providers. And that was the theme we talked about at the Analyst Day as being an important one, because what it does is it shows not only the diversification of the revenue but also the applicability of the technology and the solutions that we're developing across multiple customer segments. And that includes the enterprise because enterprise for the full year was pretty steady. It was actually from a -- it was a good performance for enterprise for the year.

I'm delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper.First, let's talk about what we've accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We",1234,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. I'm delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper.
First, let's talk about what we've accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We made major strides having implemented a series of initiatives designed to streamline our organization, reduce our cost structure, improve our balance sheet, return capital to our shareholders and drive long-term profitable growth in a challenging revenue environment.
In many areas, we exceeded our commitments by working in a more efficient manner with greater accountability and customer connectedness. And while we achieved much in 2014, I recognize that there is still more we can do to realize the full potential of our company. Rest assured, we are moving with urgency. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place in the industry and inside Juniper and we believe that our best days are still ahead.
To that end, let me share with you what I've been up to in my first few months as CEO. I spent considerable time talking and listening to our customers, our partners and our employees. Working with the senior leadership team, I set out key execution initiatives for 2015 aligned with our R&D and go-to-market strategy in the areas of Routing, Switching and Security for both service providers and enterprise customers.
I appointed Jonathan Davidson as head of Juniper's Development and Innovation, or JDI, to ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted focus on our product roadmap. Jonathan is an accomplished leader and technologist who knows how to bring focus and clarity to developing the innovative products our customers require.
I moved network automation projects that have graduated out of the incubation phase from the Office of the CTO to JDI to ensure tighter alignment with the rest of our portfolio and end-to-end solution development. And I oversaw a comprehensive review of the security components of our business, including our capabilities and product road map.
While my new role at Juniper now has the added dimension of ensuring that our business performs across a range of metrics, I will, as I always have, strive to ensure we build and deliver great products that advance the state-of-the-art in network innovation and drive long-term growth for the company.
I'll spend some time now articulating our strategy, how we plan to execute against our vision and our 2015 initiatives.
First, our strategy. We will deliver the most scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks while revolutionizing their agility, efficiency and value through automation. We will focus on customers and partners across our key verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their businesses. Product and solution differentiation, with a relentless customer focus, will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market.
Second, on execution. Our innovation engine is running stronger than ever and we are executing on a compelling product roadmap that will drive future growth across Routing, Switching and Security. I'm very excited about our product pipeline which has never been better and will offer our customers breakthrough performance and impressive capabilities unmatched in the industry.
In Security, I acknowledge that it has underperformed and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. 2015 will be a year of stabilizing our Security revenue. To win in Security, we are pivoting our strategy to building integrated solutions that focus on network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus and service provider mobile infrastructure. To emphasize, we are focusing on areas where we can compete effectively and I'm confident that we will do just that.
And importantly, we will be employing a high-leverage development strategy that takes advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation within Juniper.
Our common thread through all of this is our Junos Space SRX platform, which is adaptable to serve all of these environments and can accommodate the security needs of any number of different use cases. With this new strategy in effect, we will be delivering substantial enhancements to the SRX platform in 2015 and they will be closely intertwined with the network. We believe this new approach will allow us to deliver superior offering and we have an energized team focused on helping our customers get in front of their security challenges.
Our exciting product portfolio, along with our focused go-to-market model, are coming together to create real competitive advantage for our customers. We have a sound strategy in place, we are executing well against our plan, and we continue to make progress with new design wins and diversification of our business across our target verticals and geographies.
I'd like to turn now to the macro environment and our business. I'm confident in Juniper's future and I see substantial opportunities to grow and deliver value over the long term. In the near term, we continue to face headwinds in U.S. carrier spending, however, we do expect improvements in spending in the latter half of this year. We had signaled in July of 2014 that the market was going to be challenging and we ran our business under the assumption that it would be so for the full 4-quarter cycle that we'd historically seen.
Based on recent conversations with our customers, we still expect that to be the case with a return to growth in investment in the second half of this year. Although 2014 Routing revenue declined 4%, the diversity of our business helped offset the decline from U.S. carriers. We continue to see growth in Routing from cloud providers, cable, financial services and strategic enterprise customers that are building and operating their own network infrastructure.
In Switching, we are just at the early stages of an exciting journey of growth. There will be more to come from me over time on this topic as we take a leap in performance and automation in the data center switching space.
Let me now set expectations moving forward. While we navigate industry and customer dynamics in the near term, we have continued to focus on things that matter most to our customers and our shareholders. There are no changes to our planning assumptions. Juniper remains committed to the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day last October, where we stated an overall growth rate of 3% to 6% over the next 3 years.
We are continuing to manage the business prudently. We maintain our stated non-GAAP OpEx target of $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million. We are also committed to continuing the aggressive capital return plan that we have been executing against.
To summarize, our team remains steadfast. We will drive profitable growth and develop and deliver the innovative IP networking products and solutions that our customers rely on. We will continue to be intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives. I will be monitoring our business closely and will report on our progress quarterly.
In closing, I thank our employees for their resiliency through a year of much change. Juniper employees around the world continue to focus on executing as One-Juniper and I'm proud of and grateful for their dedication. I also appreciate the continued support of our shareholders, partners and customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details of our financial results and our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015."
30439,281088561,749689,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases as well as give you the context for the goodwill impairment charge.We have completed the restruc",1769,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases as well as give you the context for the goodwill impairment charge.
We have completed the restructuring actions that we first announced in February of 2014. In Q4, we exceeded our expense reduction commitment and implemented the additional structural actions to achieve the $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million, OpEx target for 2015. As Rami mentioned, one of the actions we completed during the quarter was to tighten the focus of our Security portfolio, allowing us to dedicate our Security resources to the SRX platform.
Total restructuring and asset write-down charges for Q4 were approximately $29 million and for the full year 2014 were $209 million. We also finalized the sale of Junos Pulse and recorded a $20 million net gain. We are executing very well on our capital return plan. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in December and repurchased $500 million of shares in Q4.
For 2014, we have returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders and we are reaffirming our commitment to return a total of $4.1 billion to our shareholders through 2016.
Overall, I am very pleased with our cost structure and the progress that we've made towards achieving the capital return commitments we made to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to address the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in Q4. As required under GAAP accounting rules, we perform a regular review of the carrying value of goodwill. During Q4, this review resulted in an estimated noncash impairment charge of $850 million related to the goodwill of our Security reporting unit. There are several factors which contributed to this impairment, including the recent underperformance of this reporting unit and our efforts to refocus our Security offerings in addition to the divestitures of Junos Pulse.
Combined, these factors result in a delay in achieving revenue and profit forecasts needed to support the historical Security goodwill valuation. I want to remind everyone that this accounting charge has no direct effect on Juniper's cash balance, operating cash flows or business outlook. We remain committed to the long-term growth targets that we outlined at our October investor meeting.
Now let's return to an analysis of the Q4 results. As a reminder, the following revenue commentary and growth rates had been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse.
Overall, revenue and demand for the fourth quarter was better than we expected. However, the themes that we've discussed over the last 6 months remain consistent. That is, large U.S. carrier demand continues to be weak, but has been somewhat offset by healthy demand from cloud providers and cable customers, pockets of momentum in EMEA and APAC service providers, and improving enterprise demand.
Looking at our demand metrics, product book-to-bill was much greater than 1. We exited 2014 with about $445 million in product backlog. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,102,000,000, down 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Product revenue was $794 million, down 17% from last year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Services revenue was $308 million, up 8% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.41. Excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.03, non-GAAP diluted earnings would have been down $0.05 per share year-over-year and up $0.02 sequentially.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by the cost reductions and a positive impact of $0.06 from the reduced share count. The sequential increase was largely driven by improvements in our cost structure.
For the quarter, GAAP loss per share was $1.81, which includes the $850 million impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.19. Included in this result is a $0.07 impact for restructuring and other charges and a $0.04 benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 benefit from the gain of the sale of Junos Pulse.
Now let's look at revenue results in detail by product area. Routing product revenue was $523 million, down 15% year-over-year and a 2% decline from the prior quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by weakness from our large U.S. carriers, partially offset by strength in cloud providers.
Switching product revenue was $174 million, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in Enterprise. Quarter-over-quarter, Switching product revenue increased 13%, driven by demand from cloud providers and financial services for our QFX products.
Security product revenue was $97 million, down a disappointing 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The decrease was due to a decline in the SRX platform from U.S. carrier customers as well as the continued decline from ScreenOS products.
Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 64.1% compared to 64.2% a year ago and the elevated level of 65.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.3%, down 0.6 point from a year ago and 1.8 points from last quarter. The expected sequential decline was primarily attributable to a shift in product and geography mix. 
Non-GAAP services gross margins were 63.6%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and 0.6 point quarter-over-quarter. This increase was due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and variable cost savings.
We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $465 million, below our guidance range, and down $74 million or 14% year-over-year. This reflects the implementation of the additional cost-saving commitment announced on our Q3 2014 earnings call as well as a significant benefit from the reduction in variable expenses in the quarter.
Our headcount ended the year at 8,806, a decline of 677 employees or 7% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 21.9%, flat year-over-year despite lower revenue. This is due to our significant focus on cost reduction efforts. The non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, down 6.1 points from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $13 million onetime benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014.
The GAAP tax expense in the quarter was $75 million on a GAAP loss of $694 million, resulting in a negative tax rate of 11%.
The GAAP loss is due to the goodwill impairment charge, which is a nondeductible tax item. The GAAP tax rate this quarter was also impacted by the gain on the sale of Junos Pulse.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2014 full year results. Total revenue was $4,532,000,000, approximately flat from last year. For the full year, large U.S. carrier revenues declined, offset by an increase from cloud providers and cable, and a steady performance from Enterprise. While we're not happy with the overall result, we are successfully achieving diversification of our customer base and increasing the relevance of our products across multiple customer segments.
Routing product revenue finished the year down 4%, primarily due to the softness from U.S. carriers in the second half. Switching product revenue was up 13% for the full year, driven by growth from cloud providers. Security product revenue was down 14% for the full year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the legacy ScreenOS products.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 64.3% for the full year, approximately flat with 2013. This is a good result and represents the value our customers see in innovation as well as our intense focus on supply chain cost reductions. The benefits of which offset both revenue mix changes and the normal levels of pricing pressure.
I'm pleased with the improvement in our overall cost structure. We ended the year with $2,015,000,000 of non-GAAP operating expenses, down $88 million or 4% from 2013. This decrease in OpEx allowed us to expand non-GAAP operating margins by 1.5 points to end the full year at 20.7% despite the challenging revenue environment.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.45, up $0.17 or 13% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to a positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from a reduction in share count of 9% year-over-year as well as significantly lower operating expenses for the full year. 
GAAP loss per share was $0.73, which includes the impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11, inclusive of a $0.45 impact to restructuring and other charges.
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of net cash and investments. The decline from Q3 was primarily due to the capital return of $542 million in the quarter. For the quarter, we generated good operating cash flow of $291 million and $763 million for the full year. DSO was 49 days, which is flat from last quarter. During 2014, in order to foster our channel business and reduce our expenses, we transitioned some of our distributor financing to Juniper's balance sheet through a targeted financial services program for certain partners. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in the range of 45 to 55 days.
Now I will provide an outlook for Q1 of 2015. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We continue to expect the demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers to be challenging throughout the first half of 2015. As we have said, we are 2 quarters into what we expect to be a 4-quarter cycle. And as a result, we remain cautious in our revenue planning assumptions.
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenue to range from $1,020,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be 63.5%, plus or minus 0.5%, at the lower end of our long-term range due to the lower volume.
Operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, plus or minus $5 million. And as a reminder, our Q4 2014 results included a significant benefit of variable cost savings. We remain focused on our cost structure and we are committed to managing expenses throughout 2015.
Operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% at the midpoint of guidance and we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 27% for the first quarter, assuming no extension of the R&D tax credit to 2015. 
We expect diluted earnings per share of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 420 million. I am also pleased to report that the board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.
Now let's open the call for questions."

So let me just address your first question which is around the Service Provider outlook primarily here in the United States. There are a number of factors that we look at. Obviously, we talk to our customers and we engage with them very closely. Number one would be things around the timing of projects that we've been working with them on. We're looking obviously at macro trends that are happening around M&A activity, the investment split between wireline and wireless that our large Service Provider customers are currently expecting to undertake. Spectrum auctions, all of these have contributed to our assessment that it makes sense for us at this point to maintain our prudent outlook looking forward and manage our business accordingly. Now that said, we are engaging with them on an ongoing basis. And based on that engagement, the timing of projects and so forth, we do anticipate that their investment levels will start to recover in the second half of this year. On your second question, which is more around the geo profile for service providers and maybe more broadly speaking, let me just touch on the Juniper business as it pertains to our performance across the globe. And I'll touch on it more from a service provider standpoint, because I believe that's what you're interested in just from your question. In EMEA, I'm actually pleased with our performance and the momentum that we're seeing both in the smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers that have really adopted a number of our products, especially our MX and PTX products, as they build out converged infrastructures. And we're actually seeing some good momentum in the core as well in the Q4 time frame. And in APAC, there it's a bit more of a complex answer, because I think the situation in places like China is somewhat different than that outside of China. In China, we have to be very laser focused on opportunities that we believe we actually have a good chance of winning and it's very much a partner-led model in doing so and that can result in some lumpiness. Now we actually had some good sequential performance in China in Q4, but generally speaking, as I said, that could be lumpy. More broadly speaking, outside of China, as you look at South Asia, for example, there, based on the number of wins that we've had historically and ongoing projects that we're working on, we're actually doing quite well and I'm pleased with our performance there. And I expect that to continue throughout this year in 2015."

It's a strategy where, from an R&D standpoint, we're really executing on the performance scale capabilities that our customers require, but just as importantly, the software-driven innovation around automation, absolutely fundamental. So that all remains absolutely intact and we're executing towards that. There are changes or tweaks to the strategy as it pertains to Security. I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks upfront, but just to reiterate, we're pivoting away from thinking about Security from a standpoint of point products. We're moving much more towards integrated solutions across Switching, Routing and Security that address domain-level problems that our customers want from us and we're executing on a very high leveraged strategy in engineering across Switching and Routing and Security. I will just say that there are tremendous assets across silicon and routing, or as I should say, silicon and software, that have largely gone untapped for security. And we have this incredible opportunity as a part, as a function of this new strategy to leverage these assets to give us relatively quick gains in the performance scale and capabilities of our security products.

I can't really talk about the -- any specific projects, but I will say this, we're very tightly aligned with our large service provider customers, both here in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Everybody, many of our customers are looking at new approaches to delivering services to their end-users using cloud-based service delivery models. And I believe that we are very well positioned with the products that we have and the strategy that we're executing on to set ourselves up to participate in the growth once it resumes. So I can't talk about any specific projects but I can say products like our virtual MX, products like the virtual SRX, or what we call the Firefly, that really represent a new way of service delivery using cloud-based models, are exactly the kind of products that our customers are requesting today and I think set us up -- set ourselves up for success when spending starts to recover."

Let me start with the Switching and Security, then I'll pass it over to Robyn for your last question. On the Switching side, I think you need to keep in mind that around 2, 2.5 years ago, we took a step back and under -- and we set up a new strategy in Switching where we took a lot of lessons that we had learned from the first set of products that we introduced into the market in the road map that we are now executing towards. So if you look at what we just announced last year, our QFX5100 product, our OCX1100 product, which is essentially a Junos Space white box switch, these are just the beginnings of what I would consider a very compelling product road map that our customers are going to respond very well to in Switching. And I have alluded to in the past, and I'll just reiterate again, that we will continue the rolling thunder, if you will, of new products in Switching this year that will contribute to the momentum that we expect. Now there are 2 dimensions to our Switching business. There is, of course, the Enterprise and the Service Provider. Service Provider, as I mentioned, has always been somewhat lumpy and as a result of that predicting the ups and downs is not going to be all that easy, but I expect to continue to take market share in Switching as a result of our go-to-market focus and our product strategy. In Security, I can't really get into the timing, although you'll find out when we make the public announcement. I will just say that I'm very excited and encouraged by what the team has accomplished thus far. And just to give you a clue, because it is a high-leverage strategy, it does not involve a large amount of time where essentially the leveraging technology that we have already developed in the company, but now packaging them up and testing them in a way that they contribute to our security capabilities and they will be capabilities from the standpoint of performance, scale and our ability to detect and stop threats faster than the competition.

Let me start with the security question first and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. I believe the industry is moving in a direction in which Security is increasingly being intimately tied with Switching and Routing where understanding traffic patterns and flows through switches and routers actually allows you to improve your security posture substantially overall when you look at a domain like the data center cloud or the service provider edge. So that's effectively the strategy that we're going to be executing towards. It does involve building Security products and they're going to be very effective Security products. But those products are going to be very much integrated, if you will, from a solutions standpoint, to Switching and Routing. They're going to be tested together and there will be a very high leveraging of technology components between silicon and software across 3 of these product lines.

The SRX products, there is a high-end and a low-end component and especially the high-end component does have a sort of a lumpiness to it because it relies on large deals and typically they are service provider deals around the world.

But I think the overarching message that I want to get across on this call is that I'm not pleased or satisfied with the performance of our Security business. I think we can and will do better. And this is a competitive space and we have to operate and innovate under that assumption and that requires that we take a much more focused approach ensuring that these products, the ones that you're asking about, the high -- the Junos-based products, are going to be incredibly competitive against everybody else in the industry, especially as it pertains to integrated solutions in Security and Routing.

Second, and just if you guys could try to give a little more quantifications of the very positive comment on book-to-bill and perhaps kind of the visibility you might have on a product level basis, core versus edge routing and whether it's more of the Switching design wins that you had that is converting into revenue."

Let me address the Security question and then I'll hand it over to Robyn to talk about the financial metrics that you're asking about. The strategy that we need to be on is, in fact, the one that you are talking about right now where we can -- we have to focus in areas where we can, in fact, be effective, where we actually have been effective historically. If, for example, you're talking about the Gi firewall, there scale, performance, power efficiency and the effectiveness of stopping attacks is very much there. And there are, in fact, synergies there with Routing and so this back-to-basics approach that I have just described where I can leverage some of the silicon enhancements that I have already funded, that I have already invested in to improve my Routing and Switching can be used very effectively in Security, can be done. And that's what we will do. So I recognize that we're probably stretching your patience a little bit here with respect to this business but I also want to emphasize that I've taken now a thorough look as part of my onboarding as CEO, and I've looked at where it is we should focus and where we should not focus. And as a result of that, we've come out with this high-leverage strategy that I think will make us very competitive in the security space."

So if you look at Juniper's Routing business overall, because vMX is in fact a router, it just has [ph] to be a virtualized router. We make the bulk of our revenue in the high performance end of that range, i.e., the larger systems are the systems that sell the most just by virtue of the applications and the use cases that we are solving for our customers. There is a -- there is also a market out there for low-end routers. It's a market that we are not as penetrated in today. It is a market where this trend of virtualization will, in fact, impact first because virtualization, i.e., this movement of services, in the case of virtual MX, it's a Layer 3 Routing service on to virtual machines that fit on standard servers, is interesting in some in the -- in its ability to deliver agility to our customers, but it certainly cannot keep up with the performance that our customers require for the high-end applications where we already are very well penetrated today. So the net of what I just said is that the virtual MX represents a great opportunity for Juniper to go after the low-end routing environments and use cases for our customers. So where our customers are thinking about deploying small PE routers at the service provider edge, they now might consider using a virtual MX software license downloaded off of our website and deployed on a standard rack server. That's a revenue opportunity for Juniper, and of course a profit opportunity for Juniper. So it's highly complementary with the rest of our portfolio. It's still -- I don't -- I want to also set some expectations because the market is still in its early stages here. This is a developing market. But in developing and shipping this product, we're essentially sending the message and putting a stake in the ground to our customers that we want to participate in this emerging market with really compelling feature-rich products. A product like this is one that we're -- we have to be proud enough of to put the MX logo on it. And that's essentially what we've done."

And even when you look at the campus dimension of this, it's actually the larger, more mission-critical campuses that we're going after because, quite frankly, it's geared towards customers that care about carrier-class capabilities, performance and scalability that we address very well. So that is how I would look at the business today. Now as we start to introduce some of the new products, certainly we'll have an opportunity to go deeper into these existing opportunities in the enterprise for data center and mission-critical campus, but we'll also open up new opportunities in the cloud providers and financial services in particular. That's how I would characterize where we are today and the opportunity going forward. I'll just touch very briefly on the second question which is -- yes, I mean, you're right. Even if we introduce new products this year, there is the typical certification and qualification cycle that can take a quarter to a -- I should say a few quarters by our customers. Enterprise customers will typically make that more in the lower end of the range, maybe a quarter to 2 quarters. Service provider customers could take 9 months to a year of certification."

And that was a theme we talked about at the Analyst Day as being an important one, because what it does is it shows not only the diversification of the revenue but also the applicability of the technology and the solutions that we're developing across multiple customer segments. And that includes the enterprise because enterprise for the full year was pretty steady. It was actually from a -- it was a good performance for enterprise for the year.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015, existing our guidance ranges. Our strong year-over-year expansion of non-GAAP EPS reflects our continued focus and operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives, and we remain steadfast in achieving our goal of realizing Juniper's full outlook.
Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015.
It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the past few months. We've organized our R&D team  to innovate as a startup and unveil the compelling lineup of new products and solutions across Routing, Switching and Security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today.
We've been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need, and the reception from those that have had early access to these new products have been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creatin solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue-generating services and a better experience with their customer. I'm energized by all of the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible.
I'll now comment briefly on highlights from Routing, Switching and Security in the first quarter.
In Routing, we're generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline, we still see growth opportunities in the Routing all up. The diversity of our customers across our focused verticals continuous to offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending. Cloud providers and cable operator continue to be a highlight for us, and we are pleased that the solid progress with large enterprise customers such as those in our government verticals that are adopting our routing and SDN solutions.
Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1, and we're starting to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest-performing IP routing platform in the market, 3 times that of the closest competitor and powered by Juniper's new express plus silicon. Coupled with our Northstar SDN controller, I'm confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these pros fully ramp.
In Switching, we are pleased that our mid-to high-end data center business was strong in the first quarter. So our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of Juniper switches, which will be the highest performance switches in the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment. Coupled with Contrail and our partnership with VMware, we're well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network.
Moving to Security. We know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months, illustrating our commitment to offering domain-level solution to have a strong element of security. Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide, and the roadmap was well received. Just last week, we announced the industry's fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth-intensive mobile deployment as well as large cloud data centers. We're getting in front of our customers security challenges, and we remain focus on areas where we can win.
Services deserves a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue, driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architecture and with the transition towards service agility and automation.
Now to take a step back. The continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for network innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking. That's Juniper. That's what we do every day. We're squarely focused on solving our customer's toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace.
Our sharpened strategy and focused go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us. We're executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9,000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter."

We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our cloud, cable and European service providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base.
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1.

In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares, and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015.
Additionally, in the quarter, we completed a $600 million bond offering, enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016.
I'd like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategy. The majority of our revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia. And in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services.
Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the route to market, we have direct relationships with all our large end-user customers.
Moving on to foreign currency fluctuation. The pricing environment remains competitive, and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuation.
Now let's take a look at some of the assumptions behind our for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build-out their networks.
In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year.
Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1, and I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.
And now, I'd like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour."

First, thanks for the question, and I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. The first question about conviction with respect to the second half, really, 2 elements to the guidance that we have provided or the outlook we provided. First and foremost, we remain very close to all of our service providers customers, including those that are here in North America. So we obviously, have good visibility into projects that we're working on together. We have good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that yes, we're pretty confident in the improvement in spending and in demand in the second half of this year. The second element I think to your question that's equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators. And clearly, these are very strategic verticals where our engagements with customers are happening on an ongoing basis, and we feel good about the strength and our position in the industry, if you will, our competitive position relative to these verticals in the second half.

First, on the overhang effect that you're talking about, we've gone through project transitions at Juniper now a number of times. So obviously are aware and always factor into our projections and our plan the potential for any sort of an overhang effect. But that said, I'm just going to drill 1 level deeper. We've been talking to our customers about these innovations for quite a long time now. in fact with many of our customers, we've developed new products with direct input and guidance from them. So it's not going to the new news for them. Secondarily, in the -- let's see the routing demand with the PTX, here, our customers have actually really like the fact that we're to invest in this product line. And so they know they have the peace of mind, if you will, that they can continue to purchase it and have the ability to upgrade in the future when their capacity requires them. On the Switching sides. I'd say the overhang effect is slim to none because of the fact that this essential addresses the gap that exists in our portfolio as opposed to something that replaces a product line that's already in the market.
On the -- your follow-up question on 25 gig and some of these new interface , we haven't got out externally and talked about the specific products. All I'd say for now is that actually, this is an important topic for us in the company.

That's the role that we play in the company. That the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there are still change our strategy. Our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships. With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed it in her opening remarks, we had deep, direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovation to market. As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past, and I still do believe, that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic but with the potential to augment it with M&A activity. Right now, the focus is primarily on getting the products that we've announced out the door, but at some point it probably makes sense for us to think about M&A to complement that and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process."

Thanks, Robyn. On the question regarding cable, first, I will remind everybody that cable is one of our key strategic verticals that we are focusing on and measuring ourselves against in terms of performance of the business. We enjoy a really strong relationship both -- on both sides of the potential merger he talked about, Comcast and Time Warner. And we continue to do so. We're working very closely with them on a variety of different projects. I personally engage with executives on both sides. So honesty, whether it happens or not, is a very neutral thing for us. It doesn't change the importance of the vertical for us, it doesn't change our invest level that we put into the vertical to make sure that we remain aligned with the innovation that we are aligned into the market. And I would say that some of the new product that we have just talked about were developed with explicit and detailed feedback about the requirements for the cable industry. We know what they want, we know what kind of performance, the capability, the feature sets, that is required to build-out their network. And I feel confident that they're actually going to play us out very well for that vertical."

The dynamics in the Routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share. And in order to take market share, you need to have better products. But we just introduced a router that has 3x the performance up anything else that's out there in the industry today at the time that traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we're capable of doing and moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively.

And we're focused on doing that in a balanced way. We want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future of the company, which is obviously, the innovation that we're delivering to market. And we will, as Rami said, grow OpEx outside of this year slower than we grow revenue. And so that's how we will continue to expand operating margins just like we did in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that is our strategy, and we're continuing to do that. So the other side of that, Tal, is that we're looking for cost improvements. A lot of those will be invisible because you have to actually take cost out to even keep it flat in any sort of environment. So we are very focused on the cost side, but in a balanced way."

But I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic, it's going to be in software. It's going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how 3 move information from place A to place B, leveraging possible and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The enterprise side is a mixed story, which is what you're seeing right now or observing right now in the numbers. Cloud, as it pertains to enterprise.

And so far, what we've heard from them and in fact, some of them have had early access to the products in terms of an ability to actually kick the tires on them.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015, exceeding our guided ranges. Our strong year-over-year expansion in non-GAAP EPS reflects our continued focus and operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives, and we remain steadfast in achieving our goal of realizing Juniper's full potential.
Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015.
It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the past few months. We've organized our R&D team to innovate as a startup and unveiled the compelling lineup of new products and solutions across routing, switching and security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today.
We've been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need, and the reception from those that have had early access to these new products has been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creating solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue-generating services and a better experience to their customer. I'm energized by all of the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible.
I'll now comment briefly on highlights from routing, switching and security in the first quarter.
In routing, we're generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline, we still see growth opportunities in routing all up. The diversity of our customers across our focused verticals continued to help offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending. Cloud providers and cable operator continued to be a highlight for us, and we are pleased with the solid progress with large enterprise customers, such as those in our government vertical, that are adopting our routing and SDN solutions.
Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1, and we started to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest-performing IP routing platform in the market, 3 times that of the closest competitor and powered by Juniper's new ExpressPlus silicon. Coupled with our Northstar WAN SDN controller, I'm confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these products fully ramp.
In switching, we are pleased that our mid to high-end data center business was strong in the first quarter, though our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of QFX [indiscernible] switches, which will be the highest performance switches on the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment. Coupled with Contrail and our partnership with VMware, we're well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network.
Moving to security. We know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months, illustrating our commitment to offering domain-level solutions that have a strong element of security. Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide, and the roadmap was well received. Just last week, we announced the industry's fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth-intensive mobile deployment as well as large cloud data centers. We're getting in front of our customers' security challenges, and we remain focus on areas where we can win.
Services deserves a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue, driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architecture and with the transition towards service agility and automation.
Now to take a step back. The continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for network innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking. That's Juniper. That's what we do every day. We're squarely focused on solving our customer's toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace.
Our sharpened strategy and focused go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us. We're executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9,000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter."

Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin",548,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.
For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, reflecting continued management of our cost structure and a significant reduction in our share count while driving innovation and remaining focused on our growth strategy. We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our cloud, cable and European service providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base.
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1. We continue to deliver on our capital return program. In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares, and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015.
Additionally, in the quarter, we completed a $600 million bond offering, enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016.
I'd like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategy. The majority of our revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia. And in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services.
Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the route to market, we have direct relationships with all our large end-user customers.
Moving on to the foreign currency fluctuation. The pricing environment remains competitive, and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuation.
Now let's take a look at some of the assumptions behind our outlook for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build out their networks.
In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year.
Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1, and I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.
And now I'd like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour."

So we obviously have good visibility into the projects that we're working on together. We have good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that yes, we're pretty confident in the improvement in spending and in demand in the second half of this year. The second element I think to your question that's equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators.

Secondarily, in the -- let's see the routing domain with the PTX, here, our customers have actually really liked the fact that we're continuing to invest in this product line.

I'd say the overhang effect is slim to none because of the fact that this essential addresses the gap that exists in our portfolio as opposed to something that replaces a product line that's already in the market. On your follow-up question on 25 gig and some of these newer interface speeds, we haven't gone out externally and talk about specific products. All I'd say for now is that actually, this is an important topic for us in the company. We understand what our customers' requirements are with respect to various different interface speeds, and we're building that into our roadmap."

And honestly, I believe that there is a need for a company that's going to be really laser-focused on developing the types of IP innovation that are necessary to get our customers to make this transition. That's the role that we play in this company. That's the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there is no change to our strategy. Our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships. With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed it in her opening remarks, we have deep, direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with, whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovation to market. As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past, and I still do believe, that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic but with the potential to augment it with M&A activity. Right now, the focus is primarily on getting the products that we've announced out the door, but at some point it probably makes sense for us to think about M&A to complement that, and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process."

The outlook that we have provided on our routing business over the next 3 years was essentially 3% to 5% in revenue growth. And I believe that's achievable because of a number of different things. First, just based on the merits of our product portfolio. The dynamics in the Routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share. And in order to take market share, you need to have better products. We've just introduced a router that has 3x the performance of anything else that's out there in the industry today at a time the traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we're capable of doing in moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively. That's why I think we have confidence in our ability to achieve these projections. And as far as the restructuring cost that you're talking about, let me just start and I'll pass it over to Robyn. The most important thing that I think you need to understand is yes, last year was a year of restructuring for us. But going forward, I think -- we are going to make sure that the investments we make in OpEx are going to be commensurate with the revenue growth. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves as we have done in the past, quite frankly, in terms of how we invest in the business. We have to see the growth that will give us the freedom, if you will, to invest in the business, not the other way around. Robyn, do you want to add anything?"

There is a transformation that's happening right now in the industry where the packet world, if you will, and the optical world are moving closer together. You're also right about the velocity of which that's happening. It's not happening very fast. There's all sorts of non-technology barriers that are in the way that will prevent it from moving very fast. As far as our own strategy, we do have a small but very effective optical team in-house at Juniper that I do expect will grow over time that has the capability of taking off-the-shelf optical components that are available to anybody really and integrate them into our routing products. But I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic, it's going to be in software. It's going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how to move information from place A to place B, leveraging optical and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible. And we have now a product called the NorthStar Controller, which is essentially our WAN SDN controller that does exactly that. Honestly, I think we have some of the best minds in the industry right now that have developed algorithms that have the ability to optimize this past across layers in ways that's very meaningful to our customers. And we're engaging with a number of different customers on this product. It's still early days, early stages, but I'm encouraged by the progress that we're making."

This -- we're still in work in progress mode, if you will, on security. I did mention that we've pivoted our strategy. We're now working on a security strategy that's very highly aligned with the rest of our product portfolio in offering domain-level solutions that have a strong security element to our customers, and we are executing on a very high level service engineering strategy. So just last week in fact, we announced the industry's fastest firewall, that's 2 terabits per second, for cloud operators that are trying to protect massive cloud infrastructure and for mobile operators that are trying to protect their mobile users, their mobile infrastructure. That's very, very meaningful, and it's only possible because of the silicon innovations that we've already developed in-house for our other product lines. And it just demonstrates the power of the synergies, if you will, from a cost standpoint that exists in your organization. So in summary, we're focusing on a narrower part of the market -- it's the network security space -- tightly aligned with the rest of our product, and we believe that we can, in fact, innovate to differentiate and win there. It's just going to take a bit of time."

I don't know whether specifically for the second half it'll have an effect on security. We haven't broken that out in that way. The enhancements that we are making right now to our Junos Space security products, I want to make clear, are certainly very compelling for the service provider space but it's also compelling for large-scale enterprises. So those that are building large enterprise clouds will benefit from the performance and scale that we're adding. and of course, it doesn't stop there. We are also continually enhancing our virtual security products and assets, which is very meaningful for the enterprise space, because at the end of the day, breaches will always happen. You're always going to be able to overcome any security barrier you put in its perimeter. Once that happens, the key is to prevent the spread of malware inside of the enterprise, and our virtual security products are now being used by enterprises to do exactly that. So yes, our strategy is very much around SP and enterprise. The scale and performance helps both, certainly more on the SP and the cloud infrastructure space but also on the enterprise side. And finally, virtualization is something that will certainly help both SP and enterprise."

On the switching side, let me sort of try to break out the business and probably shed some light on some of the observations that you've made. There is a service provider and an enterprise component to our switching business. The service provider side, especially as it pertains to cloud, has actually performed quite well, and that includes performance in the Q1 time frame, the quarter that we just wrapped up. The enterprise side is a bit of a mixed story, which is what you're seeing right now or observing right now in the numbers. Cloud, as it pertains to enterprise, so private cloud deployment, as well as enterprise IT data centers has actually done quite well. So that area of the business just I think because of the focus and some of the newer product introduction has helped us grow in that area of the business. On the campus side, you have to understand that we've just sort of done a bit of a campus pivot in our switching business or in our strategy all up that includes taking some of the products that we had in-house, take our SSL VPN business, our Pulse business, the wireless LAN business, and we've pivoted there to a partnership approach. And I think that, that strategy needs to play out over a number of quarters before we get to some sort of stability and return to growth, if you will. Once that happens, I think that will create the environment, if you will, for all of growth in switching. Last but not least, clearly, we have been competing even in the data center without a complete portfolio of products which we are just about to plug, if you will, with the innovations in the QFX10k product line that we have just announced that we will start to introduce for our customers in the middle of the year. That gives me more confidence again that I think that switching can be a good growth engine for the company going forward."

We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015, exceeding our guided ranges. Our strong year-over-year expansion in non-GAAP EPS reflects our continued focus and operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives, and we remain steadfast in achieving our goal of realizing Juniper's full potential.
Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015.
It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the past few months. We've organized our R&D team to innovate as a startup and unveiled a compelling lineup of new products and solutions across routing, switching and security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today.
We've been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need, and the reception from those that have had early access to these new products has been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creating solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue-generating services and a better experience to their customer. I'm energized by all of the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible.
I'll now comment briefly on highlights from routing, switching and security in the first quarter.
In routing, we're generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline, we still see growth opportunities in routing all up. The diversity of our customers across our focused verticals continued to help offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending. Cloud providers and cable operators continue to be a highlight for us, and we are pleased with the solid progress with large enterprise customers, such as those in our government vertical, that are adopting our routing and SDN solutions.
Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1, and we started to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest-performing IP routing platform in the market, 3 times that of the closest competitor and powered by Juniper's new ExpressPlus silicon. Coupled with our Northstar WAN SDN controller, I'm confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these products fully ramp.
In switching, we are pleased that our mid to high-end data center business was strong in the first quarter, though our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of QFX spine switches, which will be the highest performance switches on the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment. Coupled with Contrail and our partnership with VMware, we are well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network.
Moving to security. We know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months, illustrating our commitment to offering domain-level solutions that have a strong element of security. Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide, and the roadmap was well received. Just last week, we announced the industry's fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth-intensive mobile deployment as well as large cloud data centers. We're getting in front of our customers' security challenges, and we remain focus on areas where we can win.
Services deserves a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue, driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architecture and with the transition towards service agility and automation.
Now to take a step back. The continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for network innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking. That's Juniper. That's what we do every day. We're squarely focused on solving our customer's toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace.
Our sharpened strategy and focused go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us. We are executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9,000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter."

Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin",547,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.
For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, reflecting continued management of our cost structure and a significant reduction in our share count while driving innovation and remaining focused on our growth strategy. We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our cloud, cable and European service providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base.
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product-deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1. We continue to deliver on our capital return program. In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares, and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015.
Additionally, in the quarter, we completed a $600 million bond offering, enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016.
I'd like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategy. The majority of our revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia. And in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services.
Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the route to market, we have direct relationships with all our large end-user customers.
Moving on to the foreign currency fluctuation. The pricing environment remains competitive, and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuation.
Now let's take a look at some of the assumptions behind our outlook for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build out their networks.
In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year.
Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1, and I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.
And now I'd like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour."

First, thanks for the question. And I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. The first question about conviction with respect to the second half. There were really 2 elements to the guidance that we have provided or the outlook we provided. First and foremost, we remain very close to all of our service provider customers, including those that are here in North America. So we obviously have good visibility into the projects that we're working on together. We have good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that yes, we're pretty confident in the improvement in spending and in demand in the second half of this year. 
The second element I think to your question that's equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators. And clearly, these are very strategic verticals, where our engagements with customers are happening on an ongoing basis, and we feel good about the strength and our position in the industry, if you will, our competitive position relative to these verticals in the second half. And Robyn, I'll pass it to you for the rest."

And as you know, they really touch all of our different business areas in switching, routing and security. I have to sort of just remind everybody that yes, these products all go through their normal certification cycles. We have to first get them out to market. So right now, we're all working around-the-clock to make sure that we get them into our customer's hands and ready for deployment, crossing all the T's and dotting the I's, if you will, on the testing that needs to happen right now. I expect the first products that hit the market will be the switching products.

First, on the overhang effect that you're talking about, we've gone through product transitions at Juniper now a number of times. So we obviously are aware and always factor into our projections and our plan the potential for any sort of an overhang effect. But that said, I'm just going to drill one level deeper. We've been talking to our customers about these innovations for quite a long time now. In fact with many of our customers, we've developed these products with direct input and guidance from them, so it's not going to be new news for them. Secondarily, in the area -- let's see the routing domain with the PTX, here, our customers have actually really liked the fact that we're continuing to invest in this product line. And so they know they have the peace of mind, if you will, that they can continue to purchase it and have the ability to upgrade in the future when their capacity requires them. On the switching side, I'd say the overhang effect is slim to none because of the fact that this essential addresses the gap that exists in our portfolio as opposed to something that replaces a product line that's already in the market. On the --  your follow-up question on 25-gig and some of these newer interface speeds, we haven't gone out externally and talk about specific products. All I'd say for now is that actually, this is an important topic for us in the company. We understand what our customers' requirements are with respect to various different interface speeds, and we're building that into our roadmap."

There are transformational architectural shifts that are happening right now across the industry of a movement towards cloud-based service delivery, value delivery to the end users, whether that be residential or business end users. And honestly, I believe that there is a need for a company that's going to be really laser-focused on developing the types of IP innovation that are necessary to get our customers to make this transition. That's the role that we play in this company. That's the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there is no change to our strategy. Our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships. With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed it in her opening remarks, we have deep, direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with, whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovations to market. 
As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past, and I still do believe, that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic but with the potential to augment it with M&A activity. Right now, the focus is primarily on getting the products that we've announced out the door, but at some point it probably makes sense for us to think about M&A to complement that, and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process."

But in terms of an overall number, it's included in our outlook for the second half of the year, and it will be modest this year in terms of any revenue impact."

On the question regarding cable, first, I will remind everybody that cable is one of our key strategic verticals that we are focusing on and measuring ourselves against in terms of performance of the business. We enjoy a really strong relationship on both sides of the potential merger you talked about, Comcast and Time Warner. And we continue to do so. We're working very closely with them on a variety of different projects. I personally engage with the executives on both sides. So honesty, whether it happens or not is a very neutral thing for us. It doesn't change the importance of the vertical for us. It doesn't change our invest level that we would put into the vertical to make sure that we remain aligned with the innovations that we're introducing into the market. And I will say that some of the new products that we have just talked about were developed with explicit and detailed feedback about the requirements for the cable industry. We know what they want. We know what kind of performance, the capability, the feature set that is required to build out their networks.

The outlook that we had provided on our routing business over the next 3 years was essentially 3% to 5% in revenue growth. And I believe that's achievable because of a number of different things. First, just based on the merits of our product portfolio. The dynamics in the routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share. And in order to take market share, you need to have better products. We've just introduced a router that has 3x the performance of anything else that's out there in the industry today at a time the traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we're capable of doing in moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively. That's why I think we have confidence in our ability to achieve these projections. And as far as the restructuring cost that you're talking about, let me just start and I'll pass it over to Robyn. The most important thing that I think you need to understand is yes, last year was a year of restructuring for us. But going forward, I think -- we are going to make sure that the investments we make in OpEx are going to be commensurate with the revenue growth. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves as we have done in the past, quite frankly, in terms of how we invest in the business. We have to see the growth that will give us the freedom, if you will, to invest in the business, not the other way around. Robyn, do you want to add anything?"

And so that's how we will continue to expand operating margins just like we did in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that is our strategy, and we're continuing to do that.

You're also right about the velocity of which that's happening. It's not happening very fast. There's all sorts of non-technology barriers that are in the way that will prevent it from moving very fast. As far as our own strategy, we do have a small but very effective optical team in-house at Juniper that I do expect will grow over time that has the capability of taking off-the-shelf optical components that are available to anybody really and integrated them into our routing products. But I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic, it's going to be in software. It's going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how to move information from place A to place B, leveraging optical and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible. And we have now a product called the NorthStar Controller, which is essentially our WAN SDN controller that does exactly that. Honestly, I think we have some of the best minds in the industry right now that have developed algorithms that have the ability to optimize these paths across layers in a way that's very meaningful to our customers.

We are also continually enhancing our virtual security products and assets, which is very meaningful for the enterprise space, because at the end of the day, breaches will always happen.

So to me, that is -- it's really good in terms of the diversification, and it's not something that happened overnight. That's been work in progress by the team for quite some time. It speaks to the strength on the go-to-market side as well as the relevance of the products across multiple customer types. So we're pleased with that progress."

On the switching side, let me sort of try to break out the business and probably shed some light on some of the observations that you've made. There is a service provider and an enterprise component to our switching business. The service provider side, especially as it pertains to cloud, has actually performed quite well, and that includes performance in the Q1 time frame, the quarter that we just wrapped up. The enterprise side is a bit of a mixed story, which is what you're seeing right now or observing right now in the numbers. Cloud, as it pertains to enterprise, so private cloud type deployments, as well as enterprise IT data centers has actually done quite well. So that area of the business just I think because of the focus and some of the newer product introductions has helped us grow in that area of the business. 
On the campus side, you have to understand that we've just sort of done a bit of a campus pivot in our switching business or in our strategy all up that includes taking some of the products that we had in-house, take our SSL VPN business, our Pulse business, the wireless LAN business, and we've pivoted there to a partnership approach. And I think that, that strategy needs to play out over a number of quarters before we get to some sort of stability and return to growth, if you will. Once that happens, I think that will create the environment, if you will, for all up growth in switching. Last but not least, clearly, we have been competing even in the data center without a complete portfolio of products which we are just about to plug, if you will, with the innovations in the QFX10k product line that we have just announced that we will start to introduce into our -- for our customers in the middle of the year. That gives me more confidence again that I think that switching can be a good growth engine for the company going forward."

We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015, exceeding our guided ranges. Our strong year-over-year expansion in non-GAAP EPS reflects our continued focus and operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives, and we remain steadfast in achieving our goal of realizing Juniper's full potential.
Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015.
It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the past few months. We've organized our R&D team to innovate as a startup and unveiled a compelling lineup of new products and solutions across routing, switching and security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today.
We've been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need, and the reception from those that have had early access to these new products has been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creating solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue-generating services and a better experience to their customer. I'm energized by all of the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible.
I'll now comment briefly on highlights from routing, switching and security in the first quarter.
In routing, we're generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline, we still see growth opportunities in routing all up. The diversity of our customers across our focused verticals continued to help offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending. Cloud providers and cable operators continue to be a highlight for us, and we are pleased with the solid progress with large enterprise customers, such as those in our government vertical, that are adopting our routing and SDN solutions.
Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1, and we started to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest-performing IP routing platform in the market, 3 times that of the closest competitor and powered by Juniper's new ExpressPlus silicon. Coupled with our Northstar WAN SDN controller, I'm confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these products fully ramp.
In switching, we are pleased that our mid to high-end data center business was strong in the first quarter, though our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of QFX spine switches, which will be the highest performance switches on the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment. Coupled with Contrail and our partnership with VMware, we are well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network.
Moving to security. We know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months, illustrating our commitment to offering domain-level solutions that have a strong element of security. Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide, and the roadmap was well received. Just last week, we announced the industry's fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth-intensive mobile deployment as well as large cloud data centers. We're getting in front of our customers' security challenges, and we remain focus on areas where we can win.
Services deserves a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue, driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architecture and with the transition towards service agility and automation.
Now to take a step back. The continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for network innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking. That's Juniper. That's what we do every day. We're squarely focused on solving our customer's toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace.
Our sharpened strategy and focused go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us. We are executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9,000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support.
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter."

Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin",547,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.
For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, reflecting continued management of our cost structure and a significant reduction in our share count while driving innovation and remaining focused on our growth strategy. We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our cloud, cable and European service providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base.
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product-deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1. We continue to deliver on our capital return program. In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares, and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015.
Additionally, in the quarter, we completed a $600 million bond offering, enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016.
I'd like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategy. The majority of our revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia. And in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services.
Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the route to market, we have direct relationships with all our large end-user customers.
Moving on to the foreign currency fluctuation. The pricing environment remains competitive, and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuation.
Now let's take a look at some of the assumptions behind our outlook for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build out their networks.
In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year.
Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1, and I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.
And now I'd like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour."

First, thanks for the question. And I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. The first question about conviction with respect to the second half. There were really 2 elements to the guidance that we have provided or the outlook we provided. First and foremost, we remain very close to all of our service provider customers, including those that are here in North America. So we obviously have good visibility into the projects that we're working on together. We have good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that yes, we're pretty confident in the improvement in spending and in demand in the second half of this year. 
The second element I think to your question that's equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators. And clearly, these are very strategic verticals, where our engagements with customers are happening on an ongoing basis, and we feel good about the strength and our position in the industry, if you will, our competitive position relative to these verticals in the second half.

First, on the overhang effect that you're talking about, we've gone through product transitions at Juniper now a number of times. So we obviously are aware and always factor into our projections and our plan the potential for any sort of an overhang effect. But that said, I'm just going to drill one level deeper. We've been talking to our customers about these innovations for quite a long time now. In fact with many of our customers, we've developed these products with direct input and guidance from them, so it's not going to be new news for them. Secondarily, in the area -- let's see the routing domain with the PTX, here, our customers have actually really liked the fact that we're continuing to invest in this product line. And so they know they have the peace of mind, if you will, that they can continue to purchase it and have the ability to upgrade in the future when their capacity requires them. On the switching side, I'd say the overhang effect is slim to none because of the fact that this essential addresses the gap that exists in our portfolio as opposed to something that replaces a product line that's already in the market. On the --  your follow-up question on 25-gig and some of these newer interface speeds, we haven't gone out externally and talk about specific products. All I'd say for now is that actually, this is an important topic for us in the company. We understand what our customers' requirements are with respect to various different interface speeds, and we're building that into our roadmap."

That's the role that we play in this company. That's the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there is no change to our strategy. Our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships. With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed it in her opening remarks, we have deep, direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with, whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovations to market. 
As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past, and I still do believe, that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic but with the potential to augment it with M&A activity. Right now, the focus is primarily on getting the products that we've announced out the door, but at some point it probably makes sense for us to think about M&A to complement that, and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process."

The outlook that we had provided on our routing business over the next 3 years was essentially 3% to 5% in revenue growth. And I believe that's achievable because of a number of different things. First, just based on the merits of our product portfolio. The dynamics in the routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share. And in order to take market share, you need to have better products. We've just introduced a router that has 3x the performance of anything else that's out there in the industry today at a time the traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we're capable of doing in moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively. That's why I think we have confidence in our ability to achieve these projections. And as far as the restructuring cost that you're talking about, let me just start and I'll pass it over to Robyn. The most important thing that I think you need to understand is yes, last year was a year of restructuring for us. But going forward, I think -- we are going to make sure that the investments we make in OpEx are going to be commensurate with the revenue growth. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves as we have done in the past, quite frankly, in terms of how we invest in the business. We have to see the growth that will give us the freedom, if you will, to invest in the business, not the other way around. Robyn, do you want to add anything?"

There is a transformation that's happening right now in the industry where the packet world, if you will, and the optical world are moving closer together. You're also right about the velocity of which that's happening. It's not happening very fast. There's all sorts of non-technology barriers that are in the way that will prevent it from moving very fast. As far as our own strategy, we do have a small but very effective optical team in-house at Juniper that I do expect will grow over time that has the capability of taking off-the-shelf optical components that are available to anybody really and integrated them into our routing products. But I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic, it's going to be in software. It's going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how to move information from place A to place B, leveraging optical and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible. And we have now a product called the NorthStar Controller, which is essentially our WAN SDN controller that does exactly that. Honestly, I think we have some of the best minds in the industry right now that have developed algorithms that have the ability to optimize these paths across layers in a way that's very meaningful to our customers. And we're engaging with a number of different customers on this product. It's still early days, early stages, but I'm encouraged by the progress that we're making."

So those that are building large enterprise clouds will benefit from the performance and scale that we're adding. And of course, it doesn't stop there. We are also continually enhancing our virtual security products and assets, which is very meaningful for the enterprise space, because at the end of the day, breaches will always happen. You're always going to be able to overcome any security barriers you put at the perimeter. Once that happens, the key is to prevent the spread of malware inside of the enterprise, and our virtual security products are now being used by enterprises to do exactly that.

On the switching side, let me sort of try to break out the business and probably shed some light on some of the observations that you've made. There is a service provider and an enterprise component to our switching business. The service provider side, especially as it pertains to cloud, has actually performed quite well, and that includes performance in the Q1 time frame, the quarter that we just wrapped up. The enterprise side is a bit of a mixed story, which is what you're seeing right now or observing right now in the numbers. Cloud, as it pertains to enterprise, so private cloud type deployments, as well as enterprise IT data centers has actually done quite well. So that area of the business just I think because of the focus and some of the newer product introductions has helped us grow in that area of the business. 
On the campus side, you have to understand that we've just sort of done a bit of a campus pivot in our switching business or in our strategy all up that includes taking some of the products that we had in-house, take our SSL VPN business, our Pulse business, the wireless LAN business, and we've pivoted there to a partnership approach. And I think that, that strategy needs to play out over a number of quarters before we get to some sort of stability and return to growth, if you will. Once that happens, I think that will create the environment, if you will, for all up growth in switching. Last but not least, clearly, we have been competing even in the data center without a complete portfolio of products which we are just about to plug, if you will, with the innovations in the QFX10k product line that we have just announced that we will start to introduce into our -- for our customers in the middle of the year.

Beyond that, the focus that we have on this transformation that's happening toward cloud-based service delivery is very important. So we're working right now with a large Fortune 500 company in building their cloud infrastructure around the globe. And that is a testament to the strength that we have in our MetaFabric architecture, in the switching product that we've introduced into the market.

We delivered a solid second quarter for 2015.

We delivered a solid second quarter for 2015. Revenue was stronger than the outlook we provided, partially as a result of recognition of deferred revenue, but also as a result of an overall improvement in demand across several of our key customer verticals. I'm particularly pleased with the broad diversity of both bookings and revenue in the quarter.
Strong operating margin and EPS reflects our ongoing focus on execution and our disciplined approach to managing our expenses while we invest in the future of the company. I'm proud of what we've accomplished while at the same time, mindful that there is still more that we can do to achieve our company's potential. This quarter, we unveiled several new products, an innovative new addition to the QFX5100 product family of data center switches that converges compute resources and customizable logic into the network. And Ultracompact 3 terabit per second core router, the PTX 1000 that achieves unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance. And we also introduced enhancements to the SRX, which make it the industry's fastest firewall that will enable our customers to secure their Cloud network without slowing them down. 
Our priority now is on execution as we expect to begin the first shipments of these new products in the near future. We are investing in next-generation IP networking and solutions in ways that help our customers pursue business transformation with profound effect on cost efficiencies and time to market. By engaging with our customers directly at the engineering -- the engineered level, we've collaborated on solutions that produce the ultimate in agility and automation. Building these relationships has resulted in some exciting new customers this quarter, including some great technology innovators in Silicon Valley, one of which is a fast-growing global transportation network company. We're also pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing with our Cloud services customers. It's truly an honor that so many technology pioneers continue to look to Juniper to enable them to build the advanced IP networks that their businesses depend on. I know how proud all of us at Juniper are about this. 
Let me summarize some highlights this quarter across the routing, switching and security components of our business. While we are excited about the new products we announced this year, this quarter's results reflect strong performance of our current routing portfolio, and particularly, a record quarter for both the PTX and MX series. In Q2, momentum with the PTX accelerated as customers continue to embrace the architectural pieces behind this product line, which radically increases transport efficiency in any IP wide area network. We have been at the forefront of driving this vision for efficient high-performance IP transport. 
With the MX, customers began adopting our recently introduced line cards, contributing to exceptionally strong MX revenue this quarter. We also secured early orders for all of our recently announced Edge products, including the ECX 5000 and the virtual MX. We are building on the clear success of our Edge routing platform across all verticals and leveraging our worldwide market footprint to drive the architectural transition towards virtualization and programmability. We believe our compelling routing solution with our ongoing execution, will continue the drive growth and enable us to take market share. As an example, we had our first revenue customers of the virtual MX in Q2. And furthermore, our Northstar [indiscernible] controller is in beta 12 and is receiving positive field reception. 
Our Contrail solution has moved into production deployment and is fast becoming the option of choice for OpenStack environments. In Switching, we also had a record quarter for the 2 FX series. We saw good momentum in the data center with broad-based strength in the Enterprise as well as growth for Cloud provider and carrier. Customers value our Switching innovation in the data center because it helps them stay ahead of their needs for scale and performance while also providing rich Layer 3 capability, deep network visibility and automation. We expect that our high leveraged R&D strategy will allow us to easily bring the innovation to our EX product family over the next year for mission-critical Enterprise campus and branch network. 
In security, I'm pleased with our revenue growth, up 15% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, excluding Juno's Pulse. Specifically, these results were driven by growth in the high-end and branch SRX products in Cloud data center, mobile carrier and Enterprise customer segment. Having said that, there is still a lot of hard work for us to stabilize developments of our business. I continue to expect 2016 to be the year of growth for us in securities and I expect it to be a bit bumpy as we get there. Juniper's integrated network security strategy enabled us to be a strong provider of secure network and we remain confident we can win. However, it'll take this time, as I stated. 
We continue to see industry trends unfolding largely as we expected. There is no shortage of demand for network innovation as more and more organizations are turning to the Cloud to transform their business and as network traffic growth remains healthy. Our results speak to the fact that our strategy is resonating with our customers, and we will continue to deliver on our vision to be the worldwide leader in network innovation. 
In closing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive profitable long-term growth and increased shareholder value. We continue to execute with a sense of urgency and a disciplined approach to how we manage the business. I am thankful for our customers, partners and stockholders who share our vision and for our outstanding employees who work hardest to help us achieve our success. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to share her thoughts on the quarter."

Similar to last quarter, we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. For the second quarter of 2015, we delivered strong financial results, which reflect the strength in our underlying business and the focused execution to our strategy. 
Our results exceeded both our revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter, with solid sequential growth across routing, switching and security. The following factors contributed to the revenue outperformance this quarter. Revenue recognized from product deferred revenue, the majority of which was due to the delivery of product and future commitments, and a sellthrough of channel inventory. Demand was also better than we anticipated in the following areas: cloud and cable providers, enterprise and to a lesser extent, a sequential improvement from regional carriers in the Americas. 
The improved demand was also reflected in security. We had a growth quarter, primarily due to the timing of high-end SRX deployments. The underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1. Product backlog increased sequentially and significantly year-over-year. As I mentioned, the sequential decline of approximately 19% in product deferred revenue, positively contributed to our results this quarter. Our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective cost management and the significant reduction in our share count, enables us to deliver strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. 
In the quarter, we completed the $600 million of share repurchases. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q3 and the demand environment in the second half of 2015. Industry trends continue to unfold largely as we expected. So there's obviously, some uncertainty around the macroenvironment, conditions in China and certain parts of Europe. We have factored into our outlook continued weakness in China and ongoing softness in the relative exchange rate of the euro.
Consistent with our view last quarter, we anticipate an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, and this is based on the following assumption: We expect continued diversification of our revenue with Cloud and cable customers; an improved demand from large U.S. carriers. We also expect continued improvement in the Enterprise market along with growth from some of our international customers, as they continue to build-out their networks.
You can find the detailed outlook for Q3 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q2, and I would like to thank our teams for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now, I would like to open the call for questions."

On the deferred revenue, as you know, on the balance sheet, we have services and product deferred revenue. Our product deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter was down about $48 million, some of which obviously, we were expecting and anticipated in the guidance, and some of which we didn't. So I wanted to call out the fact that we did see some upside in terms of the quarter's absolute results that came off the balance sheet. Having said that, we're very, very pleased with the underlying demand. And so as you can see, our demand metrics are very healthy for the quarter both in terms of product book-to-bill but also in terms of the overall strength across our routing, Switching and security areas and the fact that the backlog is up significantly year-over-year, so primarily, the product deferred revenue. In terms of guidance for Q3, obviously, we always have projects that we're delivering and new projects that come onto the balance sheet as well as future features that we're delivering through our software releases. And so for Q3, we don't expect a material change in terms of any further recognition. The other thing that I wanted to point out, in Q2, part of the reduction in product deferred revenue was associated with the channel. So as you know, we record revenue on a sellthrough basis. In terms of the channel inventory at the end of the quarter, there was actually quite healthy demand in the Enterprise space, which we talked about, which actually resulted in some of the deferred revenue reduction in the quarter."

Obviously, we were pleased with the results in Q2 and I think there are a couple of underlying themes that are indicative of what we saw. First and foremost is the continued diversity in our business across a number of key verticals that have offset continued weakness in the telco space. So Cloud, cable were quite strong for us in Q2, but we're also seeing good business in terms of large enterprises and some of these, we call, high-tech companies in the Valley and elsewhere. The other thing that we saw happening in Q2, just around the diversification across product lines, we saw sequential growth -- healthy sequential growth across Switching, routing and securities. So all of that helped offset some of the cyclicality that would exist in the business. And your question around the second half, it's essentially largely playing out as we have been articulating over the last several quarters where we expect to see some improvement in telco. But we have not been waiting for that improvement to come idly. We have been in a moment of actively focusing on making sure that we have the products and the go-to-market focus to continue to diversify the business, and that's what's helping and I expect that to continue to help into the second half. As you get in even beyond on the second half, you mentioned the new products, we remain extremely excited about the new products that we announced in the Q1 timeframe, but those are not going to be significant contributors to revenue this year. Those really start to contribute next year, and that's yet another way that we help offset some of the cyclicality that exists in the business."

Second question is about the strength this quarter. Again, it's a question that I can ask in a quantitative way or qualitative, and the question is, how much of the growth is pent-up demand? Meaning, customers were waiting for new products for a while and there's concentrated orders in 1 quarter, 2 quarters, et cetera and after that, it normalizes down.

On the operating margin, we're -- we remain committed to our long-term model that we expressed to you guys in October of last year, which is 25% in its 3-year time frame. You -- yes, we hit 25% in the Q2 timeframe. I don't expect it to be consistently that throughout the 3-year period. It might ebb and flow a little bit as it gets there, but 25% in a 3-year timeframe remains our long-term model. In terms of the question around the strength of the business, pent-up demand, there isn't really anything that would suggest that was pent-up demand all got released on a new product or a new market opportunity. In fact, what we saw, as you mentioned, in our prepared remarks was strength across a number of our 3 key product lines, the MX, the PTX, the QFX, all of which had record products. We've been investing and innovating in all 3 product lines. We've been consistently introducing new line cards, new features and new capabilities. We've been winning new business with them throughout all of last year and the last couple of quarters of this year, and what you're seeing now is that execution playing out in terms of strength. So I don't think there is a, sort of a pent-up demand element that we're seeing right now that resulted in the strength in Q2. It's just solid execution in the part of the Juniper team."

We've been very disciplined on the cost side, as Rami indicated. We've obviously, taken out structural costs over the last year. We're investing in the right product areas and the team is continuing to do that. But we're also demonstrating that there's a lot of leverage in this model. We get some upside in the revenue or some good growth in the revenue, and we are up year-over-year, if you exclude the Juno's Pulse acquisition from the Q2 results of last year, albeit modestly, up. And a lot of that drops to the bottom line. The other part of that, which I'm sure you've noticed is that we're headed towards our 39% of revenue from an OpEx perspective which, again, as Rami mentioned we're committed to doing and we're -- we made very good progress for that this year. So there's a long way to go before we hit what we stated last year in terms of the overall business model, but we're pleased with the progress."

So I will say for example, the PTX, because of its efficiency and just the sheer scale, has started to become adopted by the Cloud provider customers. They love that sort of technology and transport efficiency in that product line. And I continue to believe that it will strengthen over time. Keep in mind that we're about to introduce pretty incredible enhancements to it, the enhancements that we announced in the Q1 timeframe that tripled the performance and reduced the power even further, and there is certain segment of our customers that just loves that type of capability, and I'll pass it on to Robyn for the OpEx question."

So on the OpEx side, as I mentioned, in response to the last question about the operating margin, we're very committed to prudent cost management of the future as we've demonstrated over the last year. Our long-term model is to grow OpEx slower than revenue, and we've done -- we've obviously, been taking out OpEx at a faster rate than our revenue declines over the last period of time. We are below the last few quarters in terms of the percentage of revenue. We've been above 40% in Q1 and the back half of last year in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue, and we're headed towards the area that we outlined in October of last year of 39%.
So our view is that the business is strong and healthy, as we mentioned before. We put out the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million at this time, last year, and we've executed to that very, very well. As we move forward, as we start to see revenue growth than we expect to be towards that 39% of revenue in terms of OpEx. And so you could say, there are certain scenarios where you could see us be slightly above the 19 25, but it would be as a result of the revenue factors and it would be on variable comp as opposed to investing more dollars. It would be around that variable nature of the cost that we've been speaking about for some time."

From a go to market standpoint, we continue to see more traction both in terms of service providers and Enterprise side. I have said in the past that we have been competing in this space with other complete portfolio that includes our spine switches, and that has limited the total addressable market opportunity for us. That's largely now being addressed this year with the new series of QFX binds switchings, that we will start to introduce. So that, I think, is going to help us maintain and improve the momentum over time. It takes time for our customers to evaluate -- to test, fully test and to certify these new spine switches. But so far, the early feedback from our customers is very positive. And your question around the portfolio sell that include Switching, routing and security is actually a very good one. It is, in fact, a muscle that we're building in the organization and a clear strategy of ours to talk to our customers around Cloud architecture as opposed to just Switching in a silo. We're doing all of our training around that and its resonating with our customers. And we've seen especially in terms of security, there is this incredible opportunity to leverage insights that comes from Switching and routing in the Cloud that can help the overall security posture and also leverage your Switching and routing in the Cloud to install policies that can prevent attacks from spreading if and when they actually occur. So that portfolio sale is very much part of our strategy, and it's all the signs that it's actually working quite effectively."

For example, some of the tie-in between security and switching routing as I mentioned in the answer to the previous question, requires certain capabilities that you actually build into these product lines. If there are, definitely. I don't know the exact percentages so that I can answer your question with, but there are definitely large opportunities that we have 1 that both in the Enterprise and in the service provider, but where it has been portfolios of some combinations of our products. In Q2, strength in Switching and in routing is anticipated. I think the momentum there is solid because of the strength of our portfolio of mutual segments. In security, we still have more work to do. There is -- we saw a good quarter. I think because of the fact that we had great opportunities and revenue in both -- in Enterprise and SP, but I think there could be a bit of a bumpy ride as a mentioned in my prepared remarks before we get to sustain growth in 2016."

It's definitely part of pretty much every strategic discussion that we have with anyone of our, especially service provider customers, in some cases, also in the Enterprise space, but mostly on the service provider side. Right now, it's very much an architectural discussion. What needs to evolve within the service provider network locations, what we call central offices or pops, to set their infrastructure up in order to be capable of delivering next-generation services using NFV. For us, what it means is first, you need to develop great VNS, virtual network function. So it's our software services that will be delivered off the cloud and we're doing just that. So we -- I just recognize our first revenue in the virtual MX in the Q2 timeframe and the virtual SRX is also a really good example of taking what is the physical product and take -- and using or leveraging all of the great functionality, but repurposing it to virtual machines sitting on generic servers. Now those VNS and that architecture, that's only part of the problem. In order to really package the solution together, you need to have automation and orchestration, the management that helps our customers actually deliver these services with agility and with ease to their end-users. And this is where products like Contrail comes in. And most service providers what we're seeing our gravitating towards an OpenStack based orchestration solution. Our goal for Contrail is simple, to make it the best networking stack for OpenStack. And I have to say that the data we're getting directly from our customers, but also through surveys for example, that were conducted at the OpenStack forum, just a few weeks ago, suggest that we are heading in the right direction in terms of achieving that goal.
So it's still early days, in summary. But I feel very good about the discussions we're having, the products we're building, the way that we're executing and the go-to-market attention we have in terms of just making sure that we emerge as true winners in this space."

Having said that, what I will share with you like we did last quarter, is the number of customers in our top 10 customers in the quarter. So for Q2, of our top 10 quarters, 4 with telco, 2 were in the U.S. and 2 were not in the U.S., 5 were Cloud and cable customers, and 1 was a large Enterprise customer. And so if you recall last quarter, there was 1 more telco customer and 1 less Cloud and cable customer in the top 10. What I will also say is this underlying theme of diversification is absolutely real in terms of the number of customers that we have in each 1 of the areas that we're talking about, both in terms of telco, not only U.S., but also international. The regional carriers, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks today or in my commentary, were actually good for us in the U.S. in the second quarter. And so the diversification is there across all of the different verticals as well as within the vertical, how many customers we're serving.

But beyond that, I think it will continue and it will move into different use case and application. Cloud providers, for example, love the fact that our security portfolio, the high-end SRX actually supports 100 gig interfaces to connect their clouds to the wide area network and when it comes to 100 gig interfaces on a firewall that we're the only game in town really, so that use case has actually become a very good use case for us. And then certainly, there is a migration that's happening in the core of the data center as well as we are taking advantage of. I don't think that there was any sort of a step function change anytime recently. I think this is an ongoing transformation that's happening across the SB space and the Cloud space and the cable space that we'll continue to take advantage of."

We call it the super core. And it did require a bit of a different approach to how one might in fact, architect a wider area core or a wide area Metro network. And quite frankly, it took us a bit of time. It took us some time to make sure our customers were educated on the transformation that's required, but also on the benefit that they could reap from this architecture. And I'm very happy that we're seeing sort of that transition happen and we're starting to see in fact, the growth on the PTX that proves that the seat we had made initially was the right one.

Is the one part that's actually been declining on a year-over-year basis for 3 quarters in a row in the high-teens. What does that mean? What's going on there? And the second question, goes back to the question Tal asked before, your effectively dodged on your long-term target right now. Are you now in the mode where you're hiring or net hiring on a year-over-year basis? Do you feel that you've been running a little bit too hot, meaning the revenue relative to the employee base that you have, that you need to ramp. I understand that long-term, you want it to clearly drive revenue faster than OpEx. But is there a 3 or 4 quarter period here where there's a little bit of a catch up, you've done a little bit too far, maybe?"

So we do service contract renewals on a 1-year and a 3-year basis. And depending on the customer, depending on whether they renew it on a 1-year or 3-year basis. And so the declines that you've seen in the long-term are specifically to do with the proportion of 3 versus Long year -- that's 1 year at any point in time. So obviously, 3-year customers, it will come down before they renew again for 3 years. And so that's what you've been seeing leadoff in the long-term. There isn't anything more than that in the long-term deferred revenue. And so when those renew, you will see that, that long-term actually improved again. In terms of hiring, I put the headcount numbers in my actual commentary. So we've ended the quarter at 8,815 heads, modestly up from the prior quarter. The 10 being very focused on how we actually continue to invest in the things that matter around the product portfolio and that type of thing. I'm not expecting a catch up in terms of headcount or a significant increase in headcount. We're managing things very well and quite honestly, that 10 are very productive the way we are."

We're absolutely not going to be religious about using our own or somebody else's. We're going to choose the best silicon to solve the problem in the most effective and differentiated way possible. And before we embark on a new silicon project ourselves at Juniper, we go through very extensive analysis to make sure that it is, in fact, something that's going to differentiate us and therefore, pay off because you know, these chip projects are -- as you know, are not inexpensive projects. And we've done exactly that. If you look at the Cloud space, for example, the access layer where it really comes down to pricing, not that much differentiation in certain market segments. You can easily go to commodity. As you get into the core, the need for power efficiency, programmability, the need for logical scale, IP routing capabilities becomes greater. And so the opportunity to differentiate with your own silicon becomes evident or becomes there. So that's what we -- that's what essentially what we have done. In the competitive environment, we understand. I mean, this is a competitive space and both from the standpoint of systems vendors that are using merchant or they're on silicon, and also from the standpoint of merchant silicon technology that's out there. And as long as we are innovating and focusing on the parts of the market where we know that we can achieve differentiation, then that's what we will do.

I think in other verticals like maybe in the Cloud space, it actually could be more project-driven.

I guess, the diversity, what it means -- or sorry, the blurring, what it means for us is that when we go and develop our products, we develop them in such a way that we become somewhat agnostic as to where in fact, they will be placed to deal with the massive amounts of IP transport traffic. In some areas, it might be in more of a nationwide or even a global network. In summary, there might be more of a metro network. What's happening today architecturally is, data centers, in some cases, are being built in more distributed locations, which puts more pressure in the metro areas and in some cases in more central locations that will put more pressure in the core areas. If we build the products that will deal with either architectural case, then we win either way, and that's exactly the goal. So it takes for example, our PTX product line. It comes in a large, a medium, and now with the PTX 1000, a small form factor and that's a perfect example of how we're building these products and the capability of these products to address the issue of scale or the challenge of scale, irrespective of the architecture that the customer ultimately wants to solve. It makes it more difficult for us to break out our numbers in the core and as we can sort of estimate it, but I've sort of tend to measure ourselves now more as routing all up in the wider network as opposed to specific to core Edge."

Strong operating margin and EPS reflects our ongoing focus on execution and our disciplined approach to managing our expenses while we invest in the future of the company. I'm proud of what we've accomplished while at the same time, mindful that there is still more we can do to achieve our company's full potential. 
This quarter, we unveiled several new products, an innovative new addition to the QFX5100 product family of data center switches that converges compute resources and customizable logic into the network. An ultracompact 3 terabit per second core router, the PTX1000, that achieves unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance. And we also introduced enhancements to the SRX, which make it the industry's fastest firewall that will enable our customers to secure their cloud network without slowing them down.
Our priority now is on execution, as we expect to begin the first shipments of these new products in the near future. We are investing in next-generation IP networking and solutions in ways that help our customers pursue business transformations with profound effects on cost efficiencies and time to market. By engaging with our customers directly at the engineer-to-engineer level, we've collaborated on solutions that produce the ultimate in agility and automation. Building these relationships has resulted in some exciting new customers this quarter, including some great technology innovators in Silicon Valley, one of which is a fast-growing global transportation network company. We're also pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing with our cloud services customers. It's truly an honor that so many technology pioneers continue to look to Juniper to enable them to build the advanced IP networks that their businesses depend on. I know how proud all of us at Juniper are about this.
Let me summarize some highlights this quarter across the routing, switching and security components of our business. While we are excited about the new products we announced this year, this quarter's results reflect strong performance of our current routing portfolio, and particularly, a record quarter for both the PTX and MX series. In Q2, momentum with the PTX accelerated as customers continue to embrace the architectural pieces behind this product line, which radically increases transport efficiency in any IP wide area network. We have been at the forefront of driving this vision for efficient high-performance IP transport.
With the MX, customers began adopting our recently introduced line cards, contributing to exceptionally strong MX revenue this quarter. We also secured early orders for all of our recently announced Edge products, including the ACX5000 and the virtual MX. We are building on the clear success of our edge routing platform across all verticals and leveraging our worldwide market footprint to drive the architectural transition towards virtualization and programmability. We believe our compelling routing solution, with our ongoing execution, will continue to drive growth and enable us to take market share. As an example, we had our first revenue customers of the virtual MX in Q2. And furthermore, our NorthStar WAN SDN Controller is in beta trial and is receiving positive field reception.
Our Contrail solution has moved into production deployment and is fast becoming the option of choice for OpenStack environments. In switching, we also had a record quarter for the QFX series. We saw good momentum in the data center with broad-based strength in the Enterprise as well as growth for cloud providers and carriers. Customers value our switching innovation in the data center because it helps them stay ahead of their needs for scale and performance while also providing rich Layer 3 capabilities, deep network visibility and automation. We expect that our high leveraged R&D strategy will allow us to easily bring that innovation to our EX product family over the next year for mission-critical enterprise campus and branch network. 
In security, I'm pleased with our revenue growth, up 15% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse. Specifically, these results were driven by growth in the high-end and branch SRX products in cloud data center, mobile carrier and enterprise customer segment. Having said that, there is still a lot of hard work for us to stabilize these elements of our business. I continue to expect 2016 to be the year of growth for us in securities and I expect it to be a bit bumpy as we get there. Juniper's integrated network security strategy enabled us to be a strong provider of secure networks and we remain confident we can win. However, it'll take us time, as I've stated.
We continue to see industry trends unfolding largely as we expected. There is no shortage of demand for network innovation as more and more organizations are turning to the cloud to transform their business and as network traffic growth remains healthy. Our results speak to the fact that our strategy is resonating with our customers, and we will continue to deliver on our vision to be the worldwide leader in network innovation.
In closing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. We continue to execute with a sense of urgency and a disciplined approach to how we manage the business. I am thankful for our customers, partners and stockholders who share our vision and for our outstanding employees who work hardest to help us achieve our success. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to share her thoughts on the quarter."

Similar to last quarter, we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. 
For the second quarter of 2015, we delivered strong financial results, which reflect the strength in our underlying business and the focused execution to our strategy.
Our results exceeded both our revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter, with solid sequential growth across routing, switching and security. The following factors contributed to the revenue outperformance this quarter. Revenue recognized from product deferred revenue, the majority of which was due to the delivery of product and feature commitments and a sell-through of channel inventory. Demand was also better than we anticipated in the following areas: cloud and cable providers, enterprise and to a lesser extent, a sequential improvement from regional carriers in the Americas.
The improved demand was also reflected in security, which had a growth quarter, primarily due to the timing of high-end SRX deployments. The underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1. Product backlog increased sequentially and significantly year-over-year. As I mentioned, the sequential decline of approximately 19% in product deferred revenue positively contributed to our results this quarter. Our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective cost management and the significant reduction in our share count enables us to deliver strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. 
In the quarter, we completed $600 million of share repurchases. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q3 and the demand environment in the second half of 2015. Industry trends continue to unfold largely as we expected. There is obviously some uncertainty around the macroenvironment, conditions in China and certain parts of Europe. We have factored into our outlook continued weakness in China and ongoing softness in the relative exchange rate of the euro.
Consistent with our view last quarter, we anticipate an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, and this is based on the following assumptions: We expect continued diversification of our revenue with cloud and cable customers and improved demand from large U.S. carriers. We also expect continued improvement in the enterprise market along with growth from some of our international customers, as they continue to build-out their networks.
You can find the detailed outlook for Q3 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q2, and I would like to thank our teams for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now, I would like to open the call for questions."

On the deferred revenue, as you know, on the balance sheet, we have services and product deferred revenue. Our product deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter was down about $48 million, some of which, obviously, we were expecting and anticipated in the guidance and some of which, we didn't. So I wanted to call out the fact that we did see some upside in terms of the quarter's absolute results that came off the balance sheet. Having said that, we're very, very pleased with the underlying demand. And so as you can see, our demand metrics are very healthy for the quarter both in terms of product book-to-bill but also in terms of the overall strength across routing, switching and security areas and the fact that the backlog is up significantly year-over-year, so primarily, the product deferred revenue. In terms of guidance for Q3, obviously, we always have projects that we're delivering and new projects that come onto the balance sheet as well as future features that we're delivering through our software releases. And so for Q3, we don't expect a material change in terms of any further recognition. The other thing that I wanted to point out, in Q2, part of the reduction in product deferred revenue was associated with the channel. So as you know, we record revenue on a sell-through basis. In terms of the channel inventory at the end of the quarter, there was actually quite healthy demand in the enterprise space, which we talked about, which actually resulted in some of the deferred revenue reduction in the quarter."

Obviously, we were pleased with the results in Q2 and I think there are a couple of underlying themes that are indicative of what we saw. First and foremost is the continued diversity in our business across a number of key verticals that have offset continued weakness in the telco space. So cloud, cable were quite strong for us in Q2 but we're also seeing good business in terms of large enterprises and some of these, what we call, high-tech companies in the Valley and elsewhere. The other thing that we saw happening in Q2 is just around the diversification across product lines, we saw sequential growth, healthy sequential growth across switching, routing and securities. So all of that helped offset some of the cyclicality that would exist in the business. And your question around the second half, it's essentially largely playing out as we have been articulating over the last several quarters where we expect to see some improvement in telco. But we have not been waiting for that improvement to come idly. We have been in a mode of actively focusing on making sure that we have the products and the go-to-market focus to continue to diversify the business, and that's what's helping -- and I expect that to continue to help into the second half. As you get in -- even beyond on the second half, you mentioned the new products, we remain extremely excited about the new products that we announced in the Q1 time frame, but those are not going to be significant contributors to revenue this year. Those really start to contribute next year, and that's yet another way that we help offset some of the cyclicality that exists in the business."

Second question is about the strength this quarter. Again, it's a question that I can ask in a quantitative way or qualitative, and the question is, how much of the growth is pent-up demand? Meaning, customers were waiting for new products for a while and there's concentrated orders in 1 quarter, 2 quarters, et cetera and after that, it normalizes down. And how much of it is more about you finally having something and then the opportunities are wide and big, and it opens up new markets, et cetera.

On the operating margin, we're -- we remain committed to our long-term model that we expressed to you guys in October of last year, which is 25% in its 3-year time frame. You -- yes, we hit 25% in the Q2 time frame. I don't expect it to be consistently that in -- throughout the 3-year period. It might ebb and flow a little bit as it gets there, but 25% in a 3-year time frame remains our long-term model. In terms of the question around the strength of the business, pent-up demand, there isn't really anything that would suggest it was pent-up demand that all got released on a new product or a new market opportunity. In fact, what we saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks was strength across a number of our key product lines, the MX, the PTX, the QFX, all of which had record products. We've been investing and innovating in all 3 product lines. We've been consistently introducing new line cards, new features and new capabilities. We've been winning new business with them throughout all of last year and the last couple of quarters of this year, and what you're seeing now is that execution playing out in terms of strength. So I don't think there is a sort of a pent-up demand element that we're seeing right now that resulted in the strength in Q2. It's just solid execution in the part of the Juniper team."

But we're also demonstrating that there's a lot of leverage in this model. We get some upside in the revenue or some good growth in the revenue, and we are up year-over-year, if you exclude the Junos Pulse acquisition from the Q2 results of last year, albeit modestly, up. And a lot of that drops to the bottom line. The other part of that, which I'm sure you've noticed is that we're headed towards our 39% of revenue from an OpEx perspective which, again, as Rami mentioned, we're committed to doing and we're -- we've made very good progress for that this year.

So I will say, for example, the PTX, because of its power efficiency and just the sheer scale, has started to become adopted by the cloud provider customers. They love that sort of technology and transport efficiency in that product line. And I continue to believe that it will strengthen over time. Keep in mind that we're about to introduce pretty incredible enhancements to it, the enhancements that we announced in the Q1 timeframe that tripled the performance and reduced the power even further, and there is a certain segment of our customers that just loves that type of capability. And I'll pass it on to Robyn for the OpEx question."

So on the OpEx side, as I mentioned, in response to the last question about the operating margin, we're very committed to prudent cost management of the future as we've demonstrated over the last year. Our long-term model is to grow OpEx slow within revenue, and we've done -- we've obviously been taking out OpEx at a faster rate than our revenue declines over the last period of time. We are below the last few quarters in terms of the percentage of revenue. We've been above 40% in Q1 and Q -- back half of last year in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue, and we're headed towards the area that we outlined in October of last year of 39%.
So our view is that the business is strong and healthy, as we mentioned before. We put out the $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million, at this time, last year, and we've executed to that very, very well. As we move forward, as we start to see revenue growth then we expect to be towards that 39% of revenue in terms of OpEx. And so you could say there are certain scenarios where you can see us being slightly above the 19 25, but it would be as a result of the revenue factors and it would be on variable comp as opposed to investing more dollars. It would be around that variable nature of the cost that we've been speaking about for some time."

On the switching side, I'm really pleased with the progress that the team has made. From a go-to-market standpoint, we continue to see more traction both in terms of service providers in the enterprise side. I have said in the past that we have been competing in this space without a complete portfolio that includes our spine switches, and that has limited the total addressable market opportunity for us. That's largely now being addressed this year with the new series of QFX spine switches that we will start to introduce. So that, I think, is going to help us maintain and improve the momentum over time. Now it takes time for our customers to evaluate, to test, fully test and to certify these new spine switches. But so far, the early feedback from our customers is very positive. And your question around the portfolio sell that includes switching, routing and security is actually a very good one. It is, in fact, a muscle that we're building in the organization and a clear strategy of ours to talk to our customers around cloud architecture as opposed to just switching in a silo. We're doing all of our training around that and it's resonating with our customers. And we've seen, especially in terms of security, there is this incredible opportunity to leverage insights that comes from switching and routing in the cloud that can help your overall security posture and also leverage your switching and routing in the cloud to install policies that can prevent attacks from spreading if and when they actually occur.

My question is also for Rami, and I also wanted to dig into the portfolio sale and specifically this is the first quarter in a long time where we've seen switching, routing and security all see very strong sequential results in the same quarter. So I was hoping you could help us understand to what degree this is due to an uptick in customers buying a portfolio of your products. And perhaps you can help us understand the pipeline you're seeing of large multi-product deals, the sales efforts here and to what extent are you seeing a competitive advantage from taking a multi-product base selling approach?"

It has existed in the past but what we're doing right now is we're essentially doubling down on the marketing, the collateral, the sales trainings that will actually, in fact, help us make this a key differentiator for us. The other thing that we're doing is we're implementing features. So for example, some of the tie-in between security and switching and routing I just mentioned in the answer to the previous question, requires certain capabilities that you actually build into these product lines. If there are, definitely. I don't know the exact percentages that I can answer your question with, but there are definitely large opportunities that we have won both in the enterprise and in the service provider, but where it has been portfolios of some combinations of our products. In Q2, strength in switching and in routing is anticipated. I think the momentum there is solid because of the strength of our portfolio of mutual segments. In security, we still have more work to do. There is -- we saw a good quarter. I think because of the fact that we had great opportunities and revenue in both -- in enterprise and SP, but I think this could be a little bit of a bumpy ride as I mentioned in my prepared remarks before we get to sustained growth in 2016."

It's definitely part of pretty much every strategic discussion that we have with anyone of our -- especially service provider customers, in some cases, also in the enterprise space, but mostly on the service provider side. Right now, it's very much an architectural discussion. What needs to evolve within the service provider network locations, what we call central offices or pops, as to set their infrastructure up in order to be capable of delivering next-generation services using NFV. For us, what it means is first, you need to develop great VNS, virtual network function. So it's our software services that will be delivered off the cloud and we're doing just that. So we -- I just recognized our first revenue in the virtual MX in the Q2 time frame and the virtual SRX is also a really good example of taking what is a physical product and take -- and using or leveraging all of the great functionality, but repurposing it to virtual machines sitting on generic servers. Now those VNS and that architecture, that's only part of the problem. In order to really package the solution together, you need to have automation and orchestration, the management that helps our customers actually deliver these services with agility and with ease to their end users. And this is where products like Contrail comes in. And most service providers, what we're seeing, are gravitating towards an OpenStack-based orchestration solution. Our goal for Contrail is simple: to make it the best networking stack for OpenStack. And I have to say that the data we're getting directly from our customers, but also through surveys, for example, that were conducted at the OpenStack forum just a few weeks ago, suggest that we are heading in the right direction in terms of achieving that goal.
So it's still early days, in summary. But I feel very good about the discussions we're having, the products we're building, the way that we're executing and the go-to-market attention we have in terms of just making sure that we emerge as true winners in this space."

In terms of the percentage of revenue, we haven't put out the overall mix in terms of percentage of revenue since Q3 of last year. We will look to possibly do that in the next period of time. Having said that, what I will share with you, like I did last quarter, is the number of customers in our top 10 customers in the quarter. So for Q2, of our top 10 customers, 4 with telco, 2 were in the U.S. and 2 were not in the U.S., 5 were cloud and cable customers and 1 was a large enterprise customer. And so if you recall last quarter, there was one more telco customer and one less Cloud and cable customer in the top 10. What I will also say is this underlying theme of diversification is absolutely real in terms of the number of customers that we have in each one of the areas that we're talking about, both in terms of telco, not only U.S. but also international. The regional carriers, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks today or in my commentary, were actually good for us in the U.S. in the second quarter. And so the diversification is there across all of the different verticals as well as within the vertical, how many customers we're serving and then also the third element of geographic diversification."

But beyond that, I think it will continue and it will move into different use cases and applications. Cloud providers, for example, love the fact that our security portfolio, the high-end SRX actually supports 100 gig interfaces to connect their clouds to the wide area network. And when it comes to 100 gig interfaces on a firewall that we're the only game in town, really, so that use case has actually become a very good use case for us. And then certainly, there is a migration that's happening in the core of the data center as well that we are taking advantage of. I don't think that there was any sort of a step function change anytime recently. I think this is an ongoing transformation that's happening across the SP space and the cloud space and the cable space that we'll continue to take advantage of."

It's around simplifying your edge architecture by deploying a single platform that can deliver all services.

And we've introduced new line cards and new capabilities to actually make this more of a reality and we certainly saw the results in Q2. PTX. This is a product line that we knew when we initially shipped it, would require a bit of a different mindset around how to develop and build-out a next-generation core architecture. We called it the Supercore. And it did require a bit of a different approach to how one might, in fact, architect a wide area core or a wide area Metro network. And quite frankly, it took us a bit of time. It took us some time to make sure our customers were educated on the transformation that's required, but also on the benefit that they could reap from this architecture. And I'm very happy that we're seeing sort of that transition happen and we're starting to see in fact, the growth on the PTX that proves that the thesis that we had made initially was the right one. QFX. This is -- first, again, we continue to add new capabilities to our QFX top of racks, switches and our access switches, but we're also, just from a go-to-market standpoint, been focusing quite heavily on our data center opportunities, our cloud opportunities, and that's where the growth in the market is and that's where the differentiation that we have in the QFX in terms of things like the Layer 3 capabilities really start to become very effective, and the results are that we saw a great quarter for the QFX."

Are you now at a mode where you're hiring -- you're net hiring on a year-over-year basis? Do you feel that you've been running a little bit too hot? Meaning the revenue relative to the employee base that you have that you need to ramp.

We're absolutely not going to be religious about using our own or somebody else's. We're going to choose the best silicon to solve the problem in the most effective and differentiated way possible. And before we embark on a new silicon project ourselves at Juniper, we go through very extensive analysis to make sure that it is, in fact, something that's going to differentiate us and therefore, pay off because you know, these chip projects are -- as you know, are not inexpensive projects. And we've done exactly that. If you look at the cloud space for example, the access layer where it really comes down to pricing, not that much differentiation in certain market segments. You can easily go to commodity. As you get into the core, the need for power efficiency, programmability, the need for logical scale, IP routing capabilities becomes greater. And so the opportunity to differentiate with your own silicon becomes evident or becomes their. So that's what we -- that's essentially what we have done. In the competitive environment, we understand.

It really depends and in some cases, it's very difficult for us to tell, really. But in the cloud space, for example, on our switching, what you're seeing there is more of the market opportunity shifting towards the data center. So we, ourselves as a company, are diverting more of our attention especially on the go-to-market side, on the support side to that opportunity and benefiting from the growth in that market segment. I think in other verticals like maybe in the cloud space, it actually could be more project-driven. It could be more of a market share phenomenon that's happening because we have traditionally been really strong and very close to that vertical and something that's paying off for us.

I guess, the diversity, what it means -- or sorry, the blurring, what it means for us is that when we go and develop our products, we develop them in such a way that we become somewhat agnostic as to where in fact, they will be placed to deal with the massive amounts of IP transport traffic. In some areas, it might be in more of a nationwide or even a global network. In summary, there might be more of a Metro network. What's happening today, architecturally, is data centers, in some cases, are being built in more distributed locations, which put more pressure in the Metro areas and in some cases, they're in more central locations that will put more pressure in the core areas. If we build the products that will deal with either architectural case, then we win either way, and that's exactly the goal. So it takes, for example, our PTX product line. It comes in a large, a medium, and now with the PTX1000, a small form factor and that's a perfect example of how we're building these products and the capability of these products to address the issue of scale or the challenge of scale, irrespective of the architecture that the customer ultimately wants to solve. It makes it more difficult for us to break out our numbers into core and yes, we can sort of estimate it, but I've sort of tend to measure ourselves now more as routing all up in the wider network as opposed to specific to core edge."

We delivered a solid second quarter for 2015. Revenue was stronger than the outlook we provided, partially as a result of recognition of deferred revenue, but also as a result of an overall improvement in demand across several of our key customer verticals. I'm particularly pleased with the broad diversity of both bookings and revenue in the quarter.
Strong operating margin and EPS reflects our ongoing focus on execution and our disciplined approach to managing our expenses while we invest in the future of the company. I'm proud of what we've accomplished while at the same time, mindful that there is still more we can do to achieve our company's full potential. 
This quarter, we unveiled several new products, an innovative new addition to the QFX5100 product family of data center switches that converges compute resources and customizable logic into the network. An ultracompact 3 terabit per second core router, the PTX1000, that achieves unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance. And we also introduced enhancements to the SRX, which make it the industry's fastest firewall that will enable our customers to secure their cloud network without slowing them down.
Our priority now is on execution, as we expect to begin the first shipments of these new products in the near future. We are investing in next-generation IP networking and solutions in ways that help our customers pursue business transformations with profound effects on cost efficiencies and time to market. By engaging with our customers directly at the engineer-to-engineer level, we've collaborated on solutions that produce the ultimate in agility and automation. Building these relationships has resulted in some exciting new customers this quarter, including some great technology innovators in Silicon Valley, one of which is a fast-growing global transportation network company. We're also pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing with our cloud services customers. It's truly an honor that so many technology pioneers continue to look to Juniper to enable them to build the advanced IP networks that their businesses depend on. I know how proud all of us at Juniper are about this.
Let me summarize some highlights this quarter across the routing, switching and security components of our business. While we are excited about the new products we announced this year, this quarter's results reflect strong performance of our current routing portfolio, and particularly, a record quarter for both the PTX and MX series. In Q2, momentum with the PTX accelerated as customers continue to embrace the architectural thesis behind this product line, which radically increases transport efficiency in any IP wide area network. We have been at the forefront of driving this vision for efficient high-performance IP transport.
With the MX, customers began adopting our recently introduced line cards, contributing to exceptionally strong MX revenue this quarter. We also secured early orders for all of our recently announced Edge products, including the ACX5000 and the virtual MX. We are building on the clear success of our edge routing platform across all verticals and leveraging our worldwide market footprint to drive the architectural transition towards virtualization and programmability. We believe our compelling routing solution, with our ongoing execution, will continue to drive growth and enable us to take market share. As an example, we had our first revenue customers of the virtual MX in Q2. And furthermore, our NorthStar WAN SDN Controller is in beta trial and is receiving positive field reception.
Our Contrail solution has moved into production deployment and is fast becoming the option of choice for OpenStack environments. In switching, we also had a record quarter for the QFX series. We saw good momentum in the data center with broad-based strength in the Enterprise as well as growth for cloud providers and carriers. Customers value our switching innovation in the data center because it helps them stay ahead of their needs for scale and performance while also providing rich Layer 3 capabilities, deep network visibility and automation. We expect that our high leveraged R&D strategy will allow us to easily bring that innovation to our EX product family over the next year for mission-critical enterprise campus and branch network. 
In security, I'm pleased with our revenue growth, up 15% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse. Specifically, these results were driven by growth in the high-end and branch SRX products in cloud data center, mobile carrier and enterprise customer segment. Having said that, there is still a lot of hard work for us to stabilize these elements of our business. I continue to expect 2016 to be the year of growth for us in security and I expect it to be a bit bumpy as we get there. Juniper's integrated network security strategy enabled us to be a strong provider of secure networks and we remain confident we can win. However, it'll take us time, as I've stated.
We continue to see industry trends unfolding largely as we expected. There is no shortage of demand for network innovation as more and more organizations are turning to the cloud to transform their business and as network traffic growth remains healthy. Our results speak to the fact that our strategy is resonating with our customers, and we will continue to deliver on our vision to be the worldwide leader in network innovation.
In closing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. We continue to execute with a sense of urgency and a disciplined approach to how we manage the business. I am thankful for our customers, partners and stockholders who share our vision and for our outstanding employees who work hardest to help us achieve our success. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to share her thoughts on the quarter."

Similar to last quarter, we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. 
For the second quarter of 2015, we delivered strong financial results, which reflect the strength in our underlying business and the focused execution to our strategy.
Our results exceeded both our revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter, with solid sequential growth across routing, switching and security. The following factors contributed to the revenue outperformance this quarter. Revenue recognized from product deferred revenue, the majority of which was due to the delivery of product and feature commitments and a sell-through of channel inventory. Demand was also better than we anticipated in the following areas: cloud and cable providers, enterprise and to a lesser extent, a sequential improvement from regional carriers in the Americas.
The improved demand was also reflected in security, which had a growth quarter, primarily due to the timing of high-end SRX deployments. The underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1. Product backlog increased sequentially and significantly year-over-year. As I mentioned, the sequential decline of approximately 19% in product deferred revenue positively contributed to our results this quarter. Our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective cost management and the significant reduction in our share count enables us to deliver strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. 
In the quarter, we completed $600 million of share repurchases. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q3 and the demand environment in the second half of 2015. Industry trends continue to unfold largely as we expected. There is obviously some uncertainty around the macroenvironment, conditions in China and certain parts of Europe. We have factored into our outlook continued weakness in China and ongoing softness in the relative exchange rate of the euro.
Consistent with our view last quarter, we anticipate an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, and this is based on the following assumptions: We expect continued diversification of our revenue with cloud and cable customers and improved demand from large U.S. carriers. We also expect continued improvement in the enterprise market along with growth from some of our international customers, as they continue to build-out their networks.
You can find the detailed outlook for Q3 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q2, and I would like to thank our teams for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now, I would like to open the call for questions."

On the deferred revenue, as you know, on the balance sheet, we have services and product deferred revenue. Our product deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter was down about $48 million, some of which, obviously, we were expecting and anticipated in the guidance and some of which, we didn't. So I wanted to call out the fact that we did see some upside in terms of the quarter's absolute results that came off the balance sheet. Having said that, we're very, very pleased with the underlying demand. And so as you can see, our demand metrics are very healthy for the quarter both in terms of product book-to-bill but also in terms of the overall strength across routing, switching and security areas and the fact that the backlog is up significantly year-over-year, so primarily, the product deferred revenue. In terms of guidance for Q3, obviously, we always have projects that we're delivering and new projects that come onto the balance sheet as well as future features that we're delivering through our software releases. And so for Q3, we don't expect a material change in terms of any further recognition. The other thing that I wanted to point out, in Q2, part of the reduction in product deferred revenue was associated with the channel. So as you know, we record revenue on a sell-through basis. In terms of the channel inventory at the end of the quarter, there was actually quite healthy demand in the enterprise space, which we talked about, which actually resulted in some of the deferred revenue reduction in the quarter."

Obviously, we were pleased with the results in Q2 and I think there are a couple of underlying themes that are indicative of what we saw. First and foremost is the continued diversity in our business across a number of key verticals that have offset continued weakness in the telco space. So cloud, cable were quite strong for us in Q2 but we're also seeing good business in terms of large enterprises and some of these, what we call, high-tech companies in the Valley and elsewhere. The other thing that we saw happening in Q2 is just around the diversification across product lines, we saw sequential growth, healthy sequential growth across switching, routing and securities. So all of that helped offset some of the cyclicality that would exist in the business. And your question around the second half, it's essentially largely playing out as we have been articulating over the last several quarters where we expect to see some improvement in telco. But we have not been waiting for that improvement to come idly. We have been in a mode of actively focusing on making sure that we have the products and the go-to-market focus to continue to diversify the business, and that's what's helping -- and I expect that to continue to help into the second half. As you get in -- even beyond on the second half, you mentioned the new products, we remain extremely excited about the new products that we announced in the Q1 time frame, but those are not going to be significant contributors to revenue this year. Those really start to contribute next year, and that's yet another way that we help offset some of the cyclicality that exists in the business."

Second question is about the strength this quarter. Again, it's a question that I can ask in a quantitative way or qualitative, and the question is, how much of the growth is pent-up demand? Meaning, customers were waiting for new products for a while and there's concentrated orders in 1 quarter, 2 quarters, et cetera and after that, it normalizes down. And how much of it is more about you finally having something and then the opportunities are wide and big, and it opens up new markets, et cetera.

You -- yes, we hit 25% in the Q2 time frame. I don't expect it to be consistently that in -- throughout the 3-year period. It might ebb and flow a little bit as it gets there, but 25% in a 3-year time frame remains our long-term model. In terms of the question around the strength of the business, pent-up demand, there isn't really anything that would suggest it was pent-up demand that all got released on a new product or a new market opportunity. In fact, what we saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks was strength across a number of our key product lines, the MX, the PTX, the QFX, all of which had record products. We've been investing and innovating in all 3 product lines. We've been consistently introducing new line cards, new features and new capabilities. We've been winning new business with them throughout all of last year and the last couple of quarters of this year, and what you're seeing now is that execution playing out in terms of strength. So I don't think there is a sort of a pent-up demand element that we're seeing right now that resulted in the strength in Q2. It's just solid execution in the part of the Juniper team."

We've, obviously, taken out structural costs over the last year. We're investing in the right product areas and the team is continuing to do that. But we're also demonstrating that there's a lot of leverage in this model. We get some upside in the revenue or some good growth in the revenue, and we are up year-over-year, if you exclude the Junos Pulse acquisition from the Q2 results of last year, albeit modestly, up. And a lot of that drops to the bottom line. The other part of that, which I'm sure you've noticed is that we're headed towards our 39% of revenue from an OpEx perspective which, again, as Rami mentioned, we're committed to doing and we're -- we've made very good progress for that this year.

So I will say, for example, the PTX, because of its power efficiency and just the sheer scale, has started to become adopted by the cloud provider customers. They love that sort of technology and transport efficiency in that product line. And I continue to believe that it will strengthen over time. Keep in mind that we're about to introduce pretty incredible enhancements to it, the enhancements that we announced in the Q1 timeframe that tripled the performance and reduced the power even further, and there is a certain segment of our customers that just loves that type of capability.

So on the OpEx side, as I mentioned, in response to the last question about the operating margin, we're very committed to prudent cost management of the future as we've demonstrated over the last year. Our long-term model is to grow OpEx slower than revenue, and we've done -- we've obviously been taking out OpEx at a faster rate than our revenue declines over the last period of time. We are below the last few quarters in terms of the percentage of revenue. We've been above 40% in Q1 and Q -- back half of last year in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue, and we're headed towards the area that we outlined in October of last year of 39%.
So our view is that the business is strong and healthy, as we mentioned before. We put out the $1.9 billion, plus or minus $25 million, at this time, last year, and we've executed to that very, very well. As we move forward, as we start to see revenue growth then we expect to be towards that 39% of revenue in terms of OpEx. And so you could say there are certain scenarios where you can see us being slightly above the 19 25, but it would be as a result of the revenue factors and it would be on variable comp as opposed to investing more dollars. It would be around that variable nature of the cost that we've been speaking about for some time."

On the switching side, I'm really pleased with the progress that the team has made. From a go-to-market standpoint, we continue to see more traction both in terms of service providers in the enterprise side. I have said in the past that we have been competing in this space without a complete portfolio that includes our spine switches, and that has limited the total addressable market opportunity for us. That's largely now being addressed this year with the new series of QFX spine switches that we will start to introduce. So that, I think, is going to help us maintain and improve the momentum over time. Now it takes time for our customers to evaluate, to test, fully test and to certify these new spine switches. But so far, the early feedback from our customers is very positive. And your question around the portfolio sell that includes switching, routing and security is actually a very good one. It is, in fact, a muscle that we're building in the organization and a clear strategy of ours to talk to our customers around cloud architecture as opposed to just switching in a silo. We're doing all of our training around that and it's resonating with our customers. And we've seen, especially in terms of security, there is this incredible opportunity to leverage insights that comes from switching and routing in the cloud that can help your overall security posture and also leverage your switching and routing in the cloud to install policies that can prevent attacks from spreading if and when they actually occur. So that portfolio sale is very much part of our strategy, and thus, all the signs are that it's actually working quite effectively."

If there are, definitely. I don't know the exact percentages that I can answer your question with, but there are definitely large opportunities that we have won both in the enterprise and in the service provider, but where it has been portfolios of some combinations of our products. In Q2, strength in switching and in routing is anticipated. I think the momentum there is solid because of the strength of our portfolio of each of those segments. In security, we still have more work to do. There is -- we saw a good quarter. I think because of the fact that we had great opportunities and revenue in both -- in enterprise and SP, but I think this could be a little bit of a bumpy ride as I mentioned in my prepared remarks before we get to sustained growth in 2016."

Right now, it's very much an architectural discussion. What needs to evolve within the service provider network locations, what we call central offices or pops, as to set their infrastructure up in order to be capable of delivering next-generation services using NFV. For us, what it means is first, you need to develop great VNS, virtual network function. So it's our software services that will be delivered off the cloud and we're doing just that. So we -- I just recognized our first revenue in the virtual MX in the Q2 time frame and the virtual SRX is also a really good example of taking what is a physical product and take -- and using or leveraging all of the great functionality, but repurposing it to virtual machines sitting on generic servers. Now those VNS and that architecture, that's only part of the problem. In order to really package the solution together, you need to have automation and orchestration, the management that helps our customers actually deliver these services with agility and with ease to their end users. And this is where products like Contrail comes in. And most service providers, what we're seeing, are gravitating towards an OpenStack-based orchestration solution. Our goal for Contrail is simple: to make it the best networking stack for OpenStack. And I have to say that the data we're getting directly from our customers, but also through surveys, for example, that were conducted at the OpenStack forum just a few weeks ago, suggest that we are heading in the right direction in terms of achieving that goal.
So it's still early days, in summary. But I feel very good about the discussions we're having, the products we're building, the way that we're executing and the go-to-market attention we have in terms of just making sure that we emerge as true winners in this space."

So for Q2, of our top 10 customers, 4 with telco, 2 were in the U.S. and 2 were not in the U.S., 5 were cloud and cable customers and 1 was a large enterprise customer. And so if you recall last quarter, there was one more telco customer and one less Cloud and cable customer in the top 10. What I will also say is this underlying theme of diversification is absolutely real in terms of the number of customers that we have in each one of the areas that we're talking about, both in terms of telco, not only U.S. but also international.

But beyond that, I think it will continue and it will move into different use cases and applications. Cloud providers, for example, love the fact that our security portfolio, the high-end SRX actually supports 100 gig interfaces to connect their clouds to the wide area network. And when it comes to 100 gig interfaces on a firewall that we're the only game in town, really, so that use case has actually become a very good use case for us. And then certainly, there is a migration that's happening in the core of the data center as well that we are taking advantage of. I don't think that there was any sort of a step function change anytime recently. I think this is an ongoing transformation that's happening across the SP space and the cloud space and the cable space that we'll continue to take advantage of."

And we continue to invest in that platform to keep ahead of the demand for capacity but also the demand for services. The thesis behind DMX was all-around convergence. It's around simplifying your edge architecture by deploying a single platform that can deliver all services. I think we were pioneers in articulating that thesis and executing that strategy, and we benefited from that. And we've introduced new line cards and new capabilities to actually make this more of a reality and we certainly saw the results in Q2. PTX. This is a product line that we knew when we initially shipped it, would require a bit of a different mindset around how to develop and build-out a next-generation core architecture. We called it the Supercore. And it did require a bit of a different approach to how one might, in fact, architect a wide area core or a wide area Metro network. And quite frankly, it took us a bit of time. It took us some time to make sure our customers were educated on the transformation that's required, but also on the benefit that they could reap from this architecture. And I'm very happy that we're seeing sort of that transition happen and we're starting to see in fact, the growth on the PTX that proves that the thesis that we had made initially was the right one. QFX. This is -- first, again, we continue to add new capabilities to our QFX top of racks switches and our access switches, but we're also, just from a go-to-market standpoint, been focusing quite heavily on our data center opportunities, our cloud opportunities, and that's where the growth in the market is and that's where the differentiation that we have in the QFX in terms of things like the Layer 3 capabilities really start to become very effective, and the results are that we saw a great quarter for the QFX."

We have seen some good wins in India, although that market we're continuing to increase our capabilities in. In terms of the Australia-New Zealand operations in Q2, had a good quarter. Japan was slightly soft but actually not bad overall, and the -- Korea was slightly negative as well. Those tend to go more in line with service provider's deployments, just given the concentration that we have in those markets around our service provider.

Are you now at a mode where you're hiring -- you're net hiring on a year-over-year basis? Do you feel that you've been running a little bit too hot? Meaning the revenue relative to the employee base that you have that you need to ramp.

There isn't anything more than that in the long-term deferred revenue. And so when those renew, you will see that, that long term actually improves again.

We're absolutely not going to be religious about using our own or somebody else's. We're going to choose the best silicon to solve the problem in the most effective and differentiated way possible. And before we embark on a new silicon project ourselves at Juniper, we go through very extensive analysis to make sure that it is, in fact, something that's going to differentiate us and therefore, pay off because you know, these chip projects are -- as you know, are not inexpensive projects. And we've done exactly that. If you look at the cloud space for example, the access layer where it really comes down to pricing, not that much differentiation in certain market segments. You can easily go to commodity. As you get into the core, the need for power efficiency, programmability, the need for logical scale, IP routing capabilities becomes greater. And so the opportunity to differentiate with your own silicon becomes evident or becomes there. So that's what we -- that's essentially what we have done. In the competitive environment, we understand. I mean, this is a competitive space and both from the standpoint of systems vendors that are using merchant or their own silicon, and also from the standpoint of merchant silicon technology that's out there, and as long as we are innovating and focusing on the parts of the market where we know that we can achieve differentiation, then that's what we will do.

One of the reasons why we decided to work on the go-to-market muscle in terms of some of these other verticals was exactly for that reason, to offset some of that cyclicality as we move forward."

Thanks for the question, Jeff. I guess, the diversity, what it means -- or sorry, the blurring, what it means for us is that when we go and develop our products, we develop them in such a way that we become somewhat agnostic as to where in fact, they will be placed to deal with the massive amounts of IP transport traffic. In some areas, it might be in more of a nationwide or even a global network. In some areas, there might be more of a Metro network. What's happening today, architecturally, is data centers, in some cases, are being built in more distributed locations, which put more pressure in the Metro areas and in some cases, they're in more central locations that will put more pressure in the core areas. If we build the products that will deal with either architectural case, then we win either way, and that's exactly the goal. So it takes, for example, our PTX product line. It comes in a large, a medium, and now with the PTX1000, a small form factor and that's a perfect example of how we're building these products and the capability of these products to address the issue of scale or the challenge of scale, irrespective of the architecture that the customer ultimately wants to solve. It makes it more difficult for us to break out our numbers into core and edge, we can sort of estimate it, but I've sort of tend to measure ourselves now more as routing all up in the wide area network as opposed to specific to core edge."

Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter financial results call. Juniper delivered another quarter of strong financial performance with robust demand metric and solid year-over-year earnings expansion. Our customer diversification strategy continue to yield positive results with revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year across routing, switching and security. Notably, this quarter, we saw strong performance of our telecom and targeted Enterprise verticals. Security was also a highlight with double-digit growth, driven by our high end products. Overall, I'm pleased with the strong pipeline and execution across key areas of the business.
The industry is in rapid transition moving towards cloud delivered value. This paradigm shift to the cloud is changing the way we access technology and how IT services are being delivered. In this ear of massive transformation, the network is at the heart of the action. Our goal as a pure play and high-performance networking is to make sure we invest and innovate to capture this transformation as it is happening. And our customers are looking to us to support them in their evolution.
We continue to lead the industry with technology innovations. In the quarter, we announced the new reference architecture called Juniper Network Unites for the Cloud Enterprise. It demonstrates our commitment to the Enterprise campus and branch segment and our ongoing focus on IP network innovation. The new reference architecture includes our new Junos Fusion Enterprise Fabric, which enable customers to simplify management of large Enterprise campus network. We also announced the new security innovation that will enable sophisticated crime intelligence, prevention and dynamic policy enforcement. We are forging new alliances and partnership that will help us drive topline growth and market expansion. 
In the quarter, we extended our partnership with NBC to help provide IP transport router to Telenor Group. We are also expanding our technology aligned sequencing system, adding network along with Rockets and Aruba, will help us deliver simple and secure managed wired and wireless solution for distributed enterprises. Because of our clear focus on execution, we're seeing some great customer product traction. 
Among our top customers in the quarter are globally recognized high-tech companies and 4 out of top 10 are cloud or cable providers. As our customers look to the future, they recognize Juniper unique proposition to deliver the ultimate in performance, agility and automation, and we are powering such companies such as British Airways and Telefonica Spain to deliver world-class cloud services without compromise. 
In addition, we are pleased with several new design wins at multiple leading edge technology companies.
I'll summarize some highlights this quarter across our technology. First, I want to underscore how strategic our solution is in defining the IT and business evolution to the cloud. Customers are moving towards open source product, softer-driven automation and containers in micro services. We secured each headwinds in 3 major segments: Software-as-a-Service, public cloud and telco cloud and FB. Of note, AT&T was a landmark deal for us this quarter.
In routing, we grew 13% year-over-year, most verticals continue to grow with solid quarter-over-quarter growth in telecom and national government. We have another record revenue quarter for both the PTX and MX series. And in Q3, adoption of some of our newest products, the PTX 5000, PTX 1000 and ACX 500, accelerated.
In switching, we had another record revenue quarter for the QFX10000 continue to see traction along with the QFX5100 with service providers, cloud and Enterprise customers. We also saw strength in the X family with Enterprise, government and service provider customer.
In security, we saw our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, excluding Junos Pulse. Our security business is showing early strength in the high-end SRX with the cloud and service provider customers, and branch is doing well in government, in managed service provider and Enterprise account. We believe the combination of new threat detection capabilities and new security partnerships is a catalyst for our return to growth. The course we set for ourselves is now playing out largely as we anticipated by remaining resolute in our focus as a pure play and high-performance networking, we are creating tremendous value for our customers and shareholders. 
Overall, while we acknowledge that recent industry consolidation could create some volatility, we believe overall spending trends remain healthy. Industry dynamics continue to unfold as we expected and Q4 guidance incorporates our view of the macro economic landscape. The world needs a like Juniper Networks. We have a clear and deliberate strategy. And as a challenger in this industry, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to challenge status quo and deliver on our with the vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. I want to thank each of our employees for being critical part of this incredible journey. And thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders, who believe in our vision to empower everyone in this increasingly connected world. I remain focused on disciplined execution of our business and prudent investments for growth to realize its full potential. Now, I'll turn over to Rob and to review the highlights of the quarter"

Our third quarter 2015 results reflected good year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We also demonstrated the strength of the diversity of our revenue across multiple verticals, technologies and geographies. Specifically, we saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both EMEA and APAC, as well as solid growth in the Enterprise across all geographies. We are pleased with the ongoing year-over-year growth and healthy underlying demand from cloud providers. However, as we have noted, this vertical can be lumpy due to the timing of deployments.
As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 results for routing in the Americas were positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue for the delivery of product and commitments.
In reviewing our top 10 customers, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S., 4 were cloud or cable providers and 1 was on Enterprise customer. We expect this diversification trend to continue, demonstrating the increased relevance of our product portfolio across multiple verticals and geographies.
Our underlying demand metric were healthy this quarter, with a year-over-year and sequential increase in product deferred revenue and a product to bill greater than one.
For the quarter, we deliver strong year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, which reflects our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure, and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we delivered results in line with our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue.
In the quarter, we have strong cash flow from operations of $293 million as a direct result of our improved operating margin. CapEx for the quarter also increased to $71 million as we focus on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. 
We repurchased $15 million of shares and paid $39 million of dividends. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we returned approximately $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now, let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q4. We expect the demand environment across multiple verticals to remain healthy and anticipate the diversification of our revenues to continue. We expect continued as urgency around the macroenvironment in China and certain parts of Europe, which we have factored into our outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. 
I'm very pleased with the ongoing operational discipline including operating expense management across the company. Our new products are gaining traction with our customers. Given the underlying healthy demand environment and to ensure that we capture the growth opportunity from these new products, we anticipate making modest increases to our go-to-market resources over the next few quarters, while remaining in line with long-term model of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue of 39%.
You can find the details outlook for our Q4 in the CFO commentary in our website. 
To summarize, I am pleased with the strong performance in Q3, including demonstrating the ability to our long-term model. We anticipate overall demand to remain healthy across our target articles and geographies.
We continue to see good traction with our customers for our new product innovation and evidenced by new design wins and a growing pipeline. As we close out the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our commitment. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now, I'd like to open the call for questions."

Honestly, I'm quite proud of how the team is executing on. On the second question with respect to routing, the trends that we are seeing in routing in the second half are largely playing out as we have been describing over the last several quarters. We've said that there should be some improvements in telcos spending in the second half of the year and that's essentially happening. We did see that improvement not only the Tier 1 but also in non-Tier 1 service providers. Bookings for routings was actually quite healthy in Q3. I think the softness was essentially as a result of cloud at difficult compare to Q2 because of the revenue recognition event we had in that quarter. But visibility is solid and the product pipeline has never been this good in many, many years in the company. So I actually feel good about where we are with respect to routing. Robyn?"

I think it's very difficult for anybody to target the MX in its entirety with all of the use cases that it serves. That flexibility is a flexibility that we built ground up to make it very competitive. Now that said, I'm not confused about the fact that this industry a competitive industry and we have to innovate in that way. Yes, I do believe that there'll be competition that will go after specific use cases that the MX does target. And in that case, we either show and demonstrate the flexibility of MX in solving that use case in a better way. Or we do have options ourselves with other products that we can use in our portfolio, whether it be the PBX or the new MX10000 that can solve that particular use case in a more efficient manner. So I think about it from a standpoint of yes, the industry is competitive.

In switching, I think the strength was broad-based and we saw a good diversity of business across both the service router and the Enterprise. We also saw healthy demand for switching around the world, which certainly help. And when you think about switching for us, it really comes down to cloud. There is a consistency across pretty much all of our market verticals. In the Enterprise, there is a cloud-first mentality, where CIOs are looking to move workload and applications to the cloud. And the service provider segment, the cable provider segments, they are looking at delivering more value to end-users through cloud-based architecture. I think our switching routing and security portfolio are coming together under the metafabric a framework in a way that's really resonating with our customers and the roadmap with the new set of spine switches that we're in the process of shifting into the market today is looking very solid in the eyes of our customers. I think I'm bullish on the long-term prospects for switching given all of these trends and the kids of the differentiation that we had in our product portfolio."

So in the spine switches, we've now shift the first version of the family of new QFX10000 spine switches, we anticipate that we'll get the second version now into our customers' hands before the end of the year. The traction that we're seeing is solid. I think these products have been now in our customers labs for some time and we are getting feedback. And we are essentially putting the finishing touches on the product. I will say that we really pushed the limits of technology in developing these products. And we did it with the hope and the anticipation that we will have 3 differentiation. And it's playing out exactly as we have predicted in terms of our differentiation relative to what's out in the market and I feel very good about that. All that being said, we have consistently said that modest revenue in the second half of this year. And that's how I would think about it was the growth really starting to happen next year. On the securities side, if you recall, earlier in the year, we talked about our security pivot, we talked about reaping synergies from the standpoint of technology and cost, as well as revenue. We talked about switch security being intimately tied to the network. And the initial focus for us was on the high end. If we offer a cloud network or a campus network to our customers, we want them to have a peace of mind that it will be resilient, it will be high-quality, it will be resilient as cop to the bad guys. And that means that you should be able to secure the network without slowing it down. So with the initial focus on the high-end, I think we've increased the confidence in the eyes of our customers. We've improved the performance of the product line dramatically. Now, in fact the high-end SRX is the fastest firewall in the industry. And so for certain use cases, around the Edge of the cloud or in service mobile structure, we have a really different should of product and we are starting to see the effect of that. That said, I don't -- I'm not yet calling mission accomplished in security. We've said that 2015 will be the year of stability. And there's still a lot of work quite frankly for us to do to shore up the rest of the product portfolio, especially when it comes to the Enterprise. And that's exactly what we're focused on right now. So pleased with what we've done thus far. A lot more work for us to do."

There are typically going to be large deals that are going to drive the overall performance. But I don't think there's anything atypical, if you will, in the quarter.  And then I will say that the project that we're engaging in are really around a number of key use cases. Edge modernization in particular such as, for example, the announcement that we made recently with Telefonica Spain, seems to be a really key theme that region. Operators are looking just to streamline their networks and deliver more value with greater agility in these networks. And for that, you need a universal Edge-type product. And the MX satisfies that role quite naturally. On the Nokia, I think we're executing to our strategy and the plan that we outline in the last earnings call. We have enjoyed deep relationship with all our customers around the world. Where there is a need to make a change in our go-to-market approach, we are doing that and we're doing it to a schedule that I think is working very well for us.

I think that growth will really start to happen in a meaningful way into 2016 [ph] and the early customer interest give us confidence in hitting the mark in terms of the challenge that they solve for our customers. On the AT&T, it's a couple of different projects that have been announced. One is that we are participating in AT&T's network on demand initiative. We're doing this, essentially we're offering or partnering with them to offer to end-users Enterprise, a new way of deriving value from their network that gives far more flexibility into the hands of the customer itself. So they will have the ability to choose on demand, the kind of services that they want AT&T to deliver to them. And it's a very software-centric approach to market that has traditionally been driven by hardware and complexity. And we want it quite frankly because we have challenged the way in which these solutions were delivered historically. We have actually little to nothing to lose because this is essentially a net new market opportunity for Juniper. And so we've demonstrated AT&T that we are very willing partners in that technology transformation and we're delighted that we're successful. And the second project is really around the various strategic network control point this being Contrail that will provide the network automation in their next-generation central offices. And this is where I provide the commentary that is just an example of the types of engagement that we're having with service providers around the world. The fact is that FPs are really looking to a new approach to running their next-generation network facilities and delivering value from those facilities. And the network controllers is very strategic control in the new architecture and Contrail and the traction we're seeing is something that's very encouraging to us."

If we go back to last year, last fall as you were kind of outlining your growth targets, one of the key tenants that you focused on was the eventual need for carriers increase their spending, particularly on core as core capacity was exhausted. At the same time, as we fast forward to this year, service providers spending at least among the U.S., it's still been relatively flat without seeing much improvement there. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color what maybe allowing that carriers in U.S. to do that. And secondly, as they do start to increase their spend, how much of an additional tailwind can this be. It seems like the good growth you've seen with the U.S. Tier 1s kicking in perhaps an accelerator. And then similarly, on security, you're delivering good year-over-year growth in that line in spite of the fact that you're characterizing a stable 2015 as a stabilization year.

As I mentioned, things are largely playing out as we expected in the second half. And I expect in the next quarter, Q4, also this current quarter, to also be a good quarter for us in terms of carrier spending. The dynamics between core and Edge -- actually, I've been consistently saying that it's become very difficult to break out those 2 domains. Much of the pressure that's happening in telecom networks today is in fact happening in the metro, happening in the Edge. And a lot of the products that traditionally been used or deployed in the quarter, now actually going to the Edge to deal with that traffic capacity. So I'm really more measuring our success in carrier routing from overall routing standpoint as opposed to specific to one domain or the other. That said, despite the fact that we are seeing some improvement in Telcos, we are not counting on that alone in driving our overall revenue growth. We're counting on continued diversity in our business. We saw that play out in the last couple of quarters with cloud kicking in to help some weakness in carrier spending. We're seeing it now this quarter with diversity across the Enterprise, governments and different geos. All of that is kicking in to support the overall growth. And it's really been demonstrates the power of that strategy to diversify our business from a technology standpoint, from a market vertical standpoint and from a geo standpoint. On security, again, this year is all about stability as Robyn mentioned, essentially we're flat year-to-date. We still had -- I feel very good of what the work that has been done that far on shoring up our competitiveness on service provider, high-end security space and in the cloud. And we still have some work to do on the Enterprise side. Just in Q3, we announced a series of enhancements to our security portfolio under the umbrella of a new architecture called Juniper Unite, that essentially brings to bear our securities switching and routing assets together to create far more agility, simplicity and ease of management that's so important to Enterprise customers in the campus and in the campus domain.

Do we believe that we can completely offset large cycles that might happen in Telcos? No. I think that's a pretty tall order. I think we demonstrated with not just diversity from a market vertical standpoint but diversity across technology areas switching and security and diversity across geos. If you look at Q3, Enterprise kicked in and also EMEA and APAC kicked in that helped us and again, grading the overall growth. I think this strategy works.

Today, the growth that we've seen with Juniper products in the cloud have largely been as a result of company's enterprises, Telcos, Cloud Providers, that have the ability to choose best to breed and to combine them in ways that solve the business challenges that they face. That said, there is a new part of the market segment on the market the value out of the box to converge architecture that includes storage, networking and software automation on top of that. We have in fact have been working with a number of different partners. So we probably have half a dozen right now, regional partners that are working with Juniper, as well as storage providers and compute providers, to build those stack offerings. And they typically are very targeted to specific market might verticals, so some might be targeting towards healthcare, others towards retail. And it's still early days.

And we want to tap into that and we have been able to tap into that. It has been also just a big focus for me personally as part of the strategic initiative that I laid out this year from a standpoint of partnerships, creating the partnerships and the commercial engine that we need to tap into the overall Enterprise opportunity, specifically as it relates to the clouds. In security, it really is a combination. In fact, there has been a few notable wins in the last couple of quarters that are net new. Having said that, I think there are also customers that have traditionally the SRX, especially the high-end SRX, and the branch SRX that we are tapping into that need to modernize their infrastructure and we're tapping into that as well.

On cloud and cable, I think those verticals have had lumpiness historically. And I'm not, let's say concerned about the relative weakness that we had sequentially in cloud in Q3. If you look at the year-over-year, it's actually quite healthy growth, a very healthy growth in fact. When I look at the fundamentals, cloud, the need to build efficient wider networks to connect the data centers together, to connect the data centers to the consumers and cloud services to peering points, it's all actually there. And I don't anticipate that changing. So the long-term trajectory and for this vertical to cost vertical, I believe is actually healthy. And the products that we're building with the specific capabilities for this vertical, the capabilities in terms of visibility and manageability, the controllability are well understood by Juniper. And we're developing our products with the intent of capturing the cloud opportunity in the future. Cable, as well can be lumpy, had been that historically. I think there's been consolidation that had been happening in the cable industry that will result in some short-term uncertainty, if you will. But the long-term prospects for us in cable I think are quite good. SP routing is all up. I think as I mentioned I feel actually quite good about where we are with respect to routing. Bookings were strong. I think it's the sequential softness in Q3, in North America, specifically had to do with timing of project, a difficult compare relative to Q2, with the revenue recognition event that we had in Q2 that we talked to you about.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter financial results call. Juniper delivered another quarter of strong financial performance with robust demand metrics and solid year-over-year earnings expansion. Our customer diversification strategy continues to yield positive results, with revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year across routing, switching and security. Notably, this quarter, we saw strong performance within our telecom and targeted Enterprise verticals. Security was also a highlight, with double-digit growth driven by our high-end SRX products. Overall, I'm pleased with the strong pipeline and execution across key areas of the business.
The industry is in rapid transition moving towards cloud delivered value. This paradigm shift to the cloud is changing the way we access technology and how IT services are being delivered. In this era of massive transformation, the network is at the heart of the action. Our goal as a pure-play and high-performance networking is to make sure we invest and innovate to capture this transformation as it is happening, and our customers are looking to us to support them in their evolution.
We continue to lead the industry with technology innovations. In the quarter, we announced the new reference architecture called Juniper Networks Unite for the cloud-enabled enterprise. It demonstrates our commitment to the enterprise campus and branch segment and our ongoing focus on IP network innovation. The new reference architecture includes our new Junos Fusion Enterprise fabric, which enables customers to simplify management of large enterprise campus network. We also announced new security innovations that will enable sophisticated threat intelligence, prevention and dynamic policy enforcement. 
We are forging new alliances and partnerships that will help us drive top line growth and market expansion. In the quarter, we extended our partnership with NEC to help provide IP transport routers to Telenor Group. We are also expanding our technology-aligned ecosystems, adding Aerohive Networks, who, along with Ruckus and Aruba, will help us deliver a simple, secured and cloud-managed wired and wireless solution for distributed enterprises. 
Because of our clear focus on execution, we're seeing some great customer and product traction. Among our top customers in the quarter are globally recognized high-tech companies, and 4 of our top 10 are cloud or cable providers. As our customers look to the future, they recognize Juniper's unique value proposition to deliver the ultimate in performance, agility and automation, and we empowering such companies, as British Airways and Telefonica Spain, to deliver world-class cloud services without compromise. In addition, we are pleased with several new design wins at multiple leading-edge technology companies.
I'll summarize some highlights this quarter across our technology. First, I want to underscore how strategic our Contrail solution is in defining the IT and business evolution to the cloud. Customers are moving towards open-source products, software-driven automation and containers in micro services. We've secured each headwind in 3 major segments: Software-as-a-Service, public cloud and telco cloud NFE. Of note, AT&T was a landmark deal for us this quarter.
In routing, we grew 13% year-over-year. Most verticals continued to grow with solid quarter-over-quarter growth in telecom and national government. We had another record revenue quarter for both the PTX and MX series. And in Q3, adoption of some of our newest products, the PTX5000, PTX1000 and ACX500, accelerated.
In switching, we had another record revenue quarter for the QFX series. The QFX10000 continue to see good traction, along with the QFX5100, with service providers, cloud and enterprise customers. We also saw strength in the EX family of switches with enterprise, government and service provider customer.
In security, we saw our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, excluding Junos Pulse. Our security business is showing early strength in the high-end SRX with cloud and service provider customers, and branch SRX is doing well in government, managed service provider and enterprise account. We believe the combination of new threat detection capabilities and new security partnerships is a catalyst spurring our return to growth. The course we set for ourselves is now playing out largely as we anticipated. By remaining resolute in our focus as a pure-play and high-performance networking, we are creating tremendous value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Overall, while we acknowledge that recent industry consolidation activity could create some volatility, we believe overall spending trends remain healthy. Industry dynamics continue to unfold as we expected, and our Q4 guidance incorporates our view of the macro economic landscape. The world needs a company like Juniper Networks. We have a clear and deliberate strategy. And as a challenger in this industry, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to challenge the status quo and deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. 
I want to thank each of our employees for being critical part of this incredible journey. And thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders who believe in our vision to empower everyone in this increasingly connected world. I remain focused on disciplined execution of our business and prudent investments for growth to realize Juniper's full potential. 
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to review a few highlights of the quarter."

Our third quarter 2015 results reflected good year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We also demonstrated the strength of the diversity of our revenue across multiple verticals, technologies and geographies. Specifically, we saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both EMEA and APAC as well as solid growth in the Enterprise across all geographies. We are pleased with the ongoing year-over-year growth and healthy underlying demand from cloud providers. However, as we have noted, this vertical can be lumpy due to the timing of deployments.
As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 results for routing in the Americas were positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue for the delivery of product and feature commitments.
In reviewing our top 10 customers, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S.; 4 were cloud and cable providers; and 1 was an enterprise customer. We expect this diversification trend to continue, demonstrating the increased relevance of our product portfolio across multiple verticals and geographies. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a year-over-year and sequential increase in product deferred revenue and a product book-to-bill greater than one. For the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, which reflects our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we delivered results in line with our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue.
In the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $293 million as a direct result of our improved operating margin. CapEx for the quarter also increased to $71 million as we focus on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. 
We repurchased $15 million of shares and paid $39 million of dividends. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we returned approximately $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q4. We expect the demand environment across multiple verticals to remain healthy and anticipate the diversification of our revenue to continue. We expect continued uncertainty around the macro environment in China and certain parts of Europe, which we have factored into our outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. 
I'm very pleased with the ongoing operational discipline, including operating expense management across the company. Our new products are gaining traction with our customers. Given the underlying healthy demand environment and to ensure that we capture the growth opportunity from these new products, we anticipate making modest increases to our go-to-market resources over the next few quarters while remaining in line with our long-term model of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue of 39%. You can find the detailed outlook to Q4 in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
To summarize, I am pleased with the strong performance in Q3, including demonstrating the ability to achieve our long-term model. We anticipate overall demand to remain healthy across our target verticals articles and geographies.
We continue to see good traction with our customers for our new product innovation as evidenced by new design wins and a growing pipeline. As we close out the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now I'd like to open the call for questions."

Thanks for the question and the comments, Jim. Let me just start, and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. First and foremost, as a pure-play innovator, the goal for Juniper is really to continue to make sure that we have really differentiated products in the market segments that we are going after. We have incredible product pipeline, as we've talked about earlier this year, and it's now in the process of shipping. And we've also consistently said that when we invest, we're going to invest in a way in a prudent manner with discipline that's commensurate with our growth as a company. That's a discipline that Robyn and I are absolutely driving through the organization right now, and it's one that I think is paying off if you just take a look at the profitability metrics in terms of operating margin and OpEx as a percentage of total revenue for the company and the Q3 time frame.

On the second question with respect to routing, the trends that we're seeing in routing in the second half are largely playing out as we have been describing over the last several quarters. We've said that there should be some improvement in telco spending in the second half of the year, and that's essentially happening. We did see that improvement, not only in the Tier 1, but also in non-Tier 1 service providers. Bookings for routings was actually quite healthy in Q3. I think the softness was essentially as a result of cloud at difficult compare relative to Q2 because of the revenue recognition event we had in that quarter. But visibility is solid, and the product pipeline has never been this good in many, many years in the company. So I actually feel good about where we are with respect to routing. Robyn?"

That requires things like virtualization, requires things like automation and visibility and analytics. And that, in my mind, requires that there be somebody that's absolutely focused on innovation in the space of IP networking. And I believe that's the role that we satisfy in this industry. As I go around the world and talk to our customers, CIOs, CTOs, CEOs, they all have a common theme in terms of the requirements, which is a technology provider that can partner with them to offer a new way for them to deliver service as a value to their end users.

But one of the biggest elements of its success has to do with the diversity of use cases that it satisfies. It really has turned into the standard Swiss Army knife, if you will, for this industry, where it has the ability to deliver all sorts of services, whether they be business or residential, or to serve at the edge of the data center, connecting data centers together or connecting data centers to the consumers of cloud services. I think it's very difficult for anybody to target the MX in its entirety with all of the use cases that it serves. That flexibility is a flexibility that we've built ground up from the start to make it very competitive. Now that said, I'm not confused about the fact that this industry is a competitive industry, and we have to innovate in that way. Yes, I do believe that there will be competition that will go after specific use cases that the MX does target. And in that case, we either show and demonstrate the flexibility of the MX in solving that use case in a better way. Or we do have options ourselves with other products that we can use in our portfolio, whether it be the PTX or the new QFX10000, that can solve a particular use case in a more efficient manner. So I -- think about it from a standpoint of, yes, the industry is competitive. We now have a diverse tool chest between the MX, the PTX and the QFX that give us all of the weapons that we need to compete effectively."

In switching, I think the strength was broad-based in that we saw a good diversity of business across both the service front or in the enterprise. We also saw healthy demand for switching around the world, which certainly helped. And when you think about switching, for us, it really comes down to cloud. There is a consistent theme across pretty much all of our market verticals. In the Enterprise, there is a cloud-first mentality, where CIOs are looking to move workloads and applications to the cloud. And the service provider segment and the cable provider segments, they are looking at delivering more value to end users through cloud-based architectures. I think our switching, routing and security portfolios are coming together under the MetaFabric architecture framework in a way that's really resonating with our customers. And the road map with the new set of spine switches that we're in the process of shifting into the market today is looking very solid in the eyes of our customers.

So we've -- in the spine switches, we've now shipped the first version of the family of new QFX10000 spine switches.

I think these products have been now in our customers' labs for some time, and we're getting feedback. And we are essentially putting the finishing touches on those products. I will say that the team really pushed the limits of technology in developing these products, and we did it with the hope and the anticipation that we will have some true differentiation. And it's playing out exactly as we have predicted in terms of our differentiation relative to what's out in the market. I feel very good about that. All that being said, we have consistently said that modest revenue in the second half of this year. And that's how I would think about it, with the growth really starting to happen next year. On the security side, if you recall, earlier in the year, we talked about our security pivot. We talked about reaping synergies from the standpoint of technology and cost as well as revenue. We talked about switch -- security as being intimately tied to the network, and the initial focus for us was on the high end. If we offer a cloud network or a campus network to our customers, we want them to have the peace of mind that it will be resilient, it'll be high-quality, it'll be resilient to attacks from the bad guys. And that means that you should be able to secure the network without slowing it down. So with the initial focus on the high end, I think we've increased the confidence in the eyes of our customer. We've improved the performance of the product line dramatically. Now in fact, the high-end SRX is the fastest firewall in the industry. And so for certain use cases, around the edge of the cloud or in service provider mobile infrastructure, we really have a differentiated product, and we're starting to see the effects of that. That said, I don't -- I am not yet calling mission accomplished on security. We've said that 2015 will be the year of stability. And there's still a lot of work, quite frankly, for us to do to shore up the rest of the product portfolio, especially as it comes to the Enterprise.

In the core, I think it's going to take a little bit of time for us as we go through the transition from T Series to the next generation to the PTX that we are shipping this year that we've launched in the early part of this year.

On Contrail, yes, I mean, you pointed out one of the wins that we are very proud of, and that is with AT&T. But let me say that pretty much every strategic discussion that we're having with our customers around the world, especially on the service provider side but also on some larger enterprises that are looking at transforming the way in which they manage their networks to simplify the operations of those networks and to add far greater agility in how they deliver services over those networks, they are thinking about approach and Contrail is part of that discussion. So we added 4 new paying customers. I think the engagements have expanded, the developer community for the open source Contrail project is only growing the amount of innovation that's not coming, not just from Juniper, but from our partners around the industry is also growing. I'm really proud of what the Contrail team has done and continues to do.

It was both on the service provider, the key or the Tier 1 telecom operators, but also in the Enterprise and particularly in government. So I actually am pretty pleased with the broad-based strength of the business. There are certainly large deals in the SP space. There are typically going to be large deals that drive the overall performance. But I don't think there's anything that's atypical, if you will, in that -- in the quarter. And then I will say that the projects that we're engaging in are really around a number of key use cases. Edge modernization, in particular, such as, for example, the announcement that we made recently with Telefonica Spain, seems to be a really key theme in that region. I think the operators are looking to streamline their networks and deliver more value with greater agility over these networks. And for that, you need a universal Edge-type product. And the MX satisfies that role quite naturally. On the Nokia, I think we're executing to our strategy and the plan that we outlined in the last earnings call. We have enjoyed a deep relationship with all of our customers around the world. And where there is a need to make a change in our go-to-market approach, we're doing that. And we're doing it to a schedule that, I think, is working very well for us. So no concern from that front."

On the product cycle, and I'm assuming here you're talking about the newer products that we're introducing in the market across routing, switching and security. It's still early stages. We've consistently said second half, we'll see modest revenue on the routing side. We haven't yet shipped the enhancements to the PTX product line that we're very excited about. I think the growth where it will really start to happen in a meaningful way in 2016 and the early customer interest give us confidence that these products are hitting the mark in terms of the challenges that they solve for our customers. On AT&T, it's a couple of different projects that have been announced. One is that we are participating in AT&T's Network on Demand initiative. We're doing this. Essentially, we're offering or partnering with them to offer to end-user's enterprises a new way of deriving value from their network that gives far more flexibility into the hands of the customer itself. So they will have the ability to choose on demand the kind of services that they want AT&T to deliver to them. And it's a very software-centric approach to market that has traditionally been driven by hardware and complexity. And we want it, quite frankly, because we have challenged the way in which these solutions were delivered historically. We had actually little to nothing to lose, because this is essentially a net new market opportunity for Juniper. And so demonstrated to AT&T that we were very willing partners in that technology transformation, and we're delighted that we were successful. And the second project is really around the various strategic network control point, this being Contrail, that will provide the network automation in their next-generation central offices. And this is where I provided the commentary that is just an example of the types of engagements that we're having with service providers around the world. The fact is that FPs are really looking to a new approach to running their next-generation network facilities and delivering value from those facilities. And the network controllers is a very strategic control point in the new architecture, and Contrail and the traction we're seeing is something that's very encouraging to us."

But if we go back to last year, last fall, as you were kind of outlining your growth targets, one of the key tenants that you focused on was the eventual need for carriers to increase their spending, particularly on cores, as core capacity was exhausted. At the same time, as we fast forward to this year, service providers are spending, at least among the U.S., it's still been relatively flat without seeing much improvement there. I'm wondering if you could give a little bit of color what may be allowing the carriers in U.S. to do that. And secondly, as they do start to increase their spend, how much of an additional tailwind can this be? It seems like with the good growth we've seen with the U.S. Tier 1s kicking in perhaps like the -- an accelerator. And then similarly, on security, you're delivering good year-over-year growth in that line in spite of the fact that you're characterizing it as a stable -- 2015 as a stabilization year. So if that's the case, should we expect to see further acceleration in security in 2016 as you turn the corner and start to enter into what you think to be your true growth?"

First, in terms of carrier spending, as I mentioned, things are largely playing out as we expected in the second half. And I expect the next quarter, Q4, to alter this current quarter, to also be a good quarter for us in terms of carrier spending. The dynamics between core and Edge -- actually, I've been consistently saying that it's become very difficult to break out those 2 domains. Much of the pressure that's happening in telecom networks today is, in fact, happening in the metro, happening in the Edge. And a lot of the products that have traditionally been used or deployed in the core, now actually going in the Edge to deal with that traffic capacity. So I'm really more measuring our success in carrier routing from an overall routing standpoint as opposed to specific to one domain or the other. That said, despite the fact that we are seeing some improvement in Telcos, we're not counting on that alone in driving our overall revenue growth. We're counting on continued diversity in our business. We saw that play out in the last couple of quarters with cloud kicking in to help some weakness in carrier spending. We're seeing it now this quarter with diversity across the Enterprise, governments and different geos. All of that is kicking in to support the overall growth. And it's really been -- demonstrates the power of that strategy to diversify our business from a technology standpoint, from a market vertical standpoint and also from a geo standpoint. On security, again, this year is all about stability. As Robyn mentioned, essentially, we're flat year-to-date. We still have -- I feel very good upon where we -- the work that has been done thus far on shoring up our competitiveness in the service provider, high-end security space and in the cloud. We still have some more work to do on the Enterprise side. And just in Q3, we announced a series of enhancements to our security portfolio under the umbrella of a new architecture called Juniper Unite, that essentially brings to bear our security switching and routing assets together to create far more agility, simplicity and ease of management that's so important to our Enterprise customers in the campus and in the campus domain. And that's what we're working on right now. And I think that, that plays out and results in growth in 2015 time frame."

We have, in fact, been working with a number of different partners.

And it is a growing segment. So I mean, at the end of the day, while switching, for example, is a huge total addressable market, the cloud elements of it is the part that's, in fact, growing. And we want to tap into that and we have been able to tap into that. It has been also just a big focus for me personally as part of the strategic initiative that I've laid out this year from a standpoint of partnerships, creating the partnerships and the commercial engine that we need to tap into the overall Enterprise opportunity, specifically as it relates to the cloud. In security, it really is a combination. In fact, there has been a few notable wins in the last couple of quarters that are net new. Having said that, I think there are also customers that have traditionally, like the SRX, especially the high-end SRX and the branch SRX that we are tapping into, that need to modernize their infrastructure and we're tapping into that as well.

In terms of the tax rate, there was a lot of excitement in the tax rate commentary this quarter, which is not usual. So on the pro forma GAAP tax rate, we will expect a slightly reduced rate. Obviously, the R&D tax credit not being renewed has had an increase in our tax rate overall for the year. If that gets renewed, that can have close to a 2% tax rate adjustment. So at this point, we wouldn't see a significantly different tax rate for next year. Expect for the addition of the R&D tax credit."

Cloud and cable, I think those verticals have had lumpiness historically. And I'm not, let's say, concerned about the relative weakness that we had sequentially in cloud in Q3. If you look at the year-over-year, it's actually quite healthy growth, a very healthy growth in fact. When I look at the fundamentals of cloud, the need to build efficient wider networks to connect the data centers together, to connect the data centers to the consumers and cloud services to peering points, it is all actually there and I don't anticipate that changing. So the long-term trajectory for this vertical, the cost vertical, I believe is actually healthy. And the products that we're building with the specific capabilities for this vertical, the capabilities in terms of visibility and manageability, controllability are well understood by Juniper. And we're developing our products with the intent of capturing the cloud opportunity in the future. Cable as well can be lumpy, had been lumpy historically. I think there's consolidation that's happening in the cable industry that will result in some short-term uncertainty, if you will. But the long-term prospects for us in cable, I think, are quite good. SP routing is all up. I think, as I mentioned, I feel actually quite good about where we are with respect to routing. Bookings were strong. I think it's the sequential softness in Q3, in North America specifically, had to do with timing of projects.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter financial results call. Juniper delivered another quarter of strong financial performance with robust demand metrics and solid year-over-year earnings expansion. Our customer diversification strategy continues to yield positive results, with revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year across routing, switching and security. Notably, this quarter, we saw strong performance within our telecom and targeted Enterprise verticals. Security was also a highlight, with double-digit growth driven by our high-end SRX products. Overall, I'm pleased with the strong pipeline and execution across key areas of the business.
The industry is in rapid transition moving towards cloud delivered value. This paradigm shift to the cloud is changing the way we access technology and how IT services are being delivered. In this era of massive transformation, the network is at the heart of the action. Our goal as a pure-play and high-performance networking is to make sure we invest and innovate to capture this transformation as it is happening, and our customers are looking to us to support them in their evolution.
We continue to lead the industry with technology innovations. In the quarter, we announced the new reference architecture called Juniper Networks Unite for the Cloud-Enabled Enterprise. It demonstrates our commitment to the enterprise campus and branch segment and our ongoing focus on IP network innovation. The new reference architecture includes our new Junos Fusion Enterprise fabric, which enables customers to simplify management of large enterprise campus network. We also announced new security innovations that will enable sophisticated threat intelligence, prevention and dynamic policy enforcement. 
We are forging new alliances and partnerships that will help us drive top line growth and market expansion. In the quarter, we extended our partnership with NEC to help provide IP transport routers to Telenor Group. We are also expanding our technology-aligned ecosystems, adding Aerohive Networks, who, along with Ruckus and Aruba, will help us deliver a simple, secure and cloud-managed wired and wireless solution for distributed enterprises. 
Because of our clear focus on execution, we're seeing some great customer and product traction. Among our top customers in the quarter are globally recognized high-tech companies, and 4 of our top 10 are cloud or cable providers. As our customers look to the future, they recognize Juniper's unique value proposition to deliver the ultimate in performance, agility and automation, and we empowering such companies, as British Airways and Telefonica Spain, to deliver world-class cloud services without compromise. In addition, we are pleased with several new design wins at multiple leading-edge technology companies.
I'll summarize some highlights this quarter across our technology. First, I want to underscore how strategic our Contrail solution is in defining the IT and business evolution to the cloud. Customers are moving towards open-source products, software-driven automation and containers in micro services. We've secured beach [ph] headwinds in 3 major segments: software-as-a-service, public cloud and telco cloud NFE. Of note, AT&T was a landmark deal for us this quarter.
In routing, we grew 13% year-over-year. Most verticals continued to grow with solid quarter-over-quarter growth in telecom and national government. We had another record revenue quarter for both the PTX and MX series. And in Q3, adoption of some of our newest products, the PTX5000, PTX1000 and ACX500, accelerated.
In switching, we had another record revenue quarter for the QFX series. The QFX10000 continue to see good traction, along with the QFX5100, with service providers, cloud and enterprise customers. We also saw strength in the EX family of switches with enterprise, government and service provider customers.
In security, we saw our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, excluding Junos Pulse. Our security business is showing early strength in the high-end SRX with cloud and service provider customers, and branch SRX is doing well in government, managed service provider and enterprise account. We believe the combination of new threat detection capabilities and new security partnerships is a catalyst spurring our return to growth. The course we set for ourselves is now playing out largely as we anticipated. By remaining resolute in our focus as a pure-play and high-performance networking, we are creating tremendous value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Overall, while we acknowledge that recent industry consolidation activity could create some volatility, we believe overall spending trends remain healthy. Industry dynamics continue to unfold as we expected, and our Q4 guidance incorporates our view of the macro economic landscape. The world needs a company like Juniper Networks. We have a clear and deliberate strategy. And as a challenger in this industry, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to challenge the status quo and deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. 
I want to thank each of our employees for being critical part of this incredible journey. And thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders who believe in our vision to empower everyone in this increasingly connected world. I remain focused on disciplined execution of our business and prudent investments for growth to realize Juniper's full potential. 
Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to review a few highlights of the quarter."

Our third quarter 2015 results reflected good year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We also demonstrated the strength of the diversity of our revenue across multiple verticals, technologies and geographies. Specifically, we saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both EMEA and APAC as well as solid growth in the Enterprise across all geographies. We are pleased with the ongoing year-over-year growth and healthy underlying demand from cloud providers. However, as we have noted, this vertical can be lumpy due to the timing of deployments.
As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 results for routing in the Americas were positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue for the delivery of product and feature commitments.
In reviewing our top 10 customers, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S.; 4 were cloud and cable providers; and 1 was an enterprise customer. We expect this diversification trend to continue, demonstrating the increased relevance of our product portfolio across multiple verticals and geographies. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a year-over-year and sequential increase in product deferred revenue and a product book-to-bill greater than one. For the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, which reflects our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we delivered results in line with our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue.
In the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $293 million as a direct result of our improved operating margin. CapEx for the quarter also increased to $71 million as we focus on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. 
We repurchased $50 million of shares and paid $39 million of dividends. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we've returned approximately $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q4. We expect the demand environment across multiple verticals to remain healthy and anticipate the diversification of our revenue to continue. We expect continued uncertainty around the macro environment in China and certain parts of Europe, which we have factored into our outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. 
I'm very pleased with the ongoing operational discipline, including operating expense management across the company. Our new products are gaining traction with our customers. Given the underlying healthy demand environment and to ensure that we capture the growth opportunities from these new products, we anticipate making modest increases to our go-to-market resources over the next few quarters while remaining in line with our long-term model of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue of 39%. You can find the detailed outlook for Q4 in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
To summarize, I am pleased with the strong performance in Q3, including demonstrating the ability to achieve our long-term model. We anticipate overall demand to remain healthy across our target verticals and geographies.
We continue to see good traction with our customers for our new product innovations as evidenced by new design wins and a growing pipeline. As we close out the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now I'd like to open the call for questions."

And certainly, that requires a level of disciplined execution and investment that we are driving through the company today that I'm, honestly, quite proud of how the team is executing on. On the second question with respect to routing, the trends that we're seeing in routing in the second half are largely playing out as we have been describing over the last several quarters. We've said that there should be some improvement in telco spending in the second half of the year, and that's essentially happening. We did see that improvement, not only in the Tier 1, but also in non-Tier 1 service providers. Bookings for routing was actually quite healthy in Q3. I think the softness was essentially as a result of cloud, a difficult compare relative to Q2 because of the revenue recognition event we had in that quarter. But visibility is solid, and the product pipeline has never been this good in many, many years in the company. So I actually feel good about where we are with respect to routing. Robyn?"

But one of the biggest elements of its success has to do with the diversity of use cases that it satisfies. It really has turned into the standard Swiss Army knife, if you will, for this industry, where it has the ability to deliver all sorts of services, whether they be business or residential, or to serve at the edge of the data center, connecting data centers together or connecting data centers to the consumers of cloud services. I think it's very difficult for anybody to target the MX in its entirety with all of the use cases that it serves. That flexibility is flexibility that we've built ground up from the start to make it very competitive. Now that said, I'm not confused about the fact that this industry is a competitive industry, and we have to innovate in that way. Yes, I do believe that there will be competition that will go after specific use cases that the MX does target. And in that case, we either show and demonstrate the flexibility of the MX in solving that use case in a better way. Or we do have options ourselves with other products that we can use in our portfolio, whether it be the PTX or the new QFX10000, that can solve a particular use case in a more efficient manner. So I think about it from a standpoint of, yes, the industry is competitive. We now have a diverse tool chest between the MX, the PTX and the QFX that give us all of the weapons that we need to compete effectively."

In switching, I think the strength was broad-based in that we saw a good diversity of business across both the service provider and the enterprise. We also saw healthy demands for switching around the world, which certainly helped. And when you think about switching, for us, it really comes down to cloud. There is a consistent theme across pretty much all of our market verticals. In the Enterprise, there is a cloud-first mentality, where CIOs are looking to move workloads and applications to the cloud. In the service provider segment and cable provider segments, they are looking at delivering more value to end users through cloud-based architectures. I think our switching, routing and security portfolios are coming together under the MetaFabric architecture framework in a way that's really resonating with our customers. And the road map with the new set of spine switches that we're in the process of shifting into the market today is looking very solid in the eyes of our customers. I think I'm bullish on the long-term prospects for switching given all of these trends and because of the differentiation that we have in our product portfolio."

So we've -- in the spine switches, we've now shipped the first version of the family of new QFX10000 spine switches. We anticipate that we'll get the second version out into our customers' hands before the end of the year. The traction that we're seeing is solid. I think these products have been now in our customers' labs for some time, and we're getting feedback. And we are essentially putting the finishing touches on those products. I will say that the team really pushed the limits of technology in developing these products, and we did it with the hope and the anticipation that we will have some true differentiation. And it's playing out exactly as we have predicted in terms of our differentiation relative to what's out in the market. I feel very good about that. All that being said, we have consistently said that modest revenue in the second half of this year. And that's how I would think about it, with the growth really starting to happen next year. On the security side, if you recall, earlier in the year, we talked about our security pivot. We talked about reaping synergies from the standpoint of technology and cost as well as revenue. We talked about switch -- security as being intimately tied to the network, and the initial focus for us was on the high end. If we offer a cloud network or a campus network to our customers, we want them to have the peace of mind that it will be resilient, it'll be high-quality, it'll be resilient to attacks from the bad guys. And that means that you should be able to secure the network without slowing it down. So with the initial focus on the high end, I think we've increased the confidence in the eyes of our customers. We've improved the performance of the product line dramatically. It's now, in fact, the high-end SRX is the fastest firewall in the industry. And so for certain use cases, around the edge of the cloud or in service provider mobile infrastructure, we really have a differentiated product, and we're starting to see the effect of that. That said, I don't -- I am not yet calling mission accomplished on security. We've said that 2015 will be the year of stability. And there's still a lot of work, quite frankly, for us to do to shore up the rest of the product portfolio, especially as it comes to the Enterprise. And that's exactly what we're focused on right now. So pleased with what we've done thus far. A lot more work for us to do."

And just based on the project activity, I believe that we're doing quite well there. In the core, I think it's going to take a little bit of time for us as we go through the transition from T Series to the next generation to the PTX that we are shipping this year that we've launched in the early part of this year. So I'm not sure what's going to happen there with respect to share. But I feel good about the roadmap and the focus in terms of the prospects for share gains going forward into next year. On Contrail, yes, I mean, you pointed out one of the wins that we are very proud of, and that is with AT&T. But let me say that pretty much every strategic discussion that we're having with our customers around the world, especially on the service provider side, but also in some larger enterprises, that are looking at transforming the way in which they manage their networks to simplify the operations of those networks and to add far greater agility in how they deliver services over those networks. They are thinking about a new architectural approach and Contrail is part of that discussion. So we added 4 new paying customers. I think the engagements have expanded, the developer community for the open source Contrail project is only growing the amount of innovation that's not coming, not just from Juniper, but from our partners around the industry is also growing. I'm really proud of what the Contrail team has done and continues to do. And AT&T, I mean, certainly we're extremely proud of that project, but I think that's just an example of others that were also engaging in."

And then I will say that the projects that we're engaging in are really around a number of key use cases. Edge modernization, in particular, such as, for example, the announcement that we made recently with Telefonica Spain, seems to be a really key theme in that region. I think operators are looking to streamline their networks and deliver more value with greater agility over these networks. And for that, you need a universal Edge-type product. And the MX satisfies that role quite naturally. On the Nokia, I think we're executing to our strategy and the plan that we outlined in the last earnings call. We have enjoyed a deep relationship with all of our customers around the world. And where there is a need to make a change in our go-to-market approach, we're doing that. And we're doing it to a schedule that, I think, is working very well for us. So no concern from that front."

On the product cycle, and I'm assuming here you're talking about the newer products that we're introducing to the market across routing, switching and security. It's still early stages. We've consistently said second half, we'll see modest revenue on the routing side. We haven't yet shipped the enhancements to the PTX product line that we're very excited about. I think the growth where it will really start to happen in a meaningful way in 2016 and the early customer interest give us confidence that these products are hitting the mark in terms of the challenges that they solve for our customers. On AT&T, it's a couple of different projects that have been announced. One is that we are participating in AT&T's Network on Demand initiative. We're doing this. Essentially, we're offering -- we're partnering with them to offer to end-users' enterprises a new way of deriving value from their network that gives far more flexibility into the hands of the customer itself. So they will have the ability to choose on-demand the kinds of services that they want AT&T to deliver to them. And it's a very software-centric approach to a market that has traditionally been driven by hardware and complexity. And we won it, quite frankly, because we have challenged the ways in which these solutions were delivered historically. We had actually little to nothing to lose, because this is essentially a net new market opportunity for Juniper. And so we demonstrated to AT&T that we were very willing partners in that technology transformation, and we're delighted that we were successful. And the second project is really around the very strategic network control point, this being Contrail, that will provide the network automation in their next-generation central offices. And this is where I provided the commentary that, that's just an example of the types of engagements that we're having with service providers around the world. The fact is that SPs are really looking to a new approach to running their next-generation network facilities and delivering value from those facilities. And the network controller is a very strategic control point in the new architecture, and Contrail and the traction it's seeing is something that's very encouraging to us."

But if we go back to last year, last fall, as you were kind of outlining your growth targets, one of the key tenets that you focused on was the eventual need for carriers to increase their spending, particularly on cores, as core capacity was exhausted. At the same time, as we fast forward to this year, service provider spending, at least among the U.S., it's still been relatively flat without seeing much improvement there. I'm wondering if you could give a little bit of color what may be allowing the carriers in U.S. to do that. And secondly, as they do start to increase their spend, how much of an additional tailwind can this be? It seems like with the good growth you've seen with the U.S. Tier 1s kicking in, perhaps XBA [ph] an accelerator. And then similarly, on security, you're delivering good year-over-year growth in that line in spite of the fact that you're characterizing it as a stable -- 2015 as a stabilization year.

Much of the pressure that's happening in telecom networks today is, in fact, happening in the metro, happening in the Edge. And a lot of the products that have traditionally been used or deployed in the core, are now actually going in the Edge to deal with that traffic capacity. So I'm really more measuring our success in carrier routing from an overall routing standpoint as opposed to specific to one domain or the other. That said, despite the fact that we are seeing some improvements in Telcos, we're not counting on that alone in driving our overall revenue growth. We're counting on continued diversity in our business. We saw that play out in the last couple of quarters with cloud kicking in to help some weakness in carrier spending. We're seeing it now this quarter with diversity across the Enterprise, governments and different geos. All of that is kicking in to support the overall growth. And it's really been -- demonstrates the power of that strategy to diversify our business from a technology standpoint, from a market vertical standpoint and also from a geo standpoint. On security, again, this year is all about stability. As Robyn mentioned, essentially, we're flat year-to-date. We still have -- I feel very good upon where we -- the work that has been done thus far on shoring up our competitiveness in the service provider, high-end security space and in the cloud. We still have some more work to do on the Enterprise side. And just in Q3, we announced a series of enhancements to our security portfolio under the umbrella of a new architecture called Juniper Unite, that essentially brings to bear our security switching and routing assets together to create far more agility, simplicity and ease of management that's so important to our Enterprise customers in the campus and in the campus domain. And that's what we're working on right now. And I think that, that plays out and results in growth in 2016 time frame."

I will say you're actually hitting on a topic that is very important to me and to my leadership team. Today, the growth that we've seen with Juniper products in the cloud have largely been as a result of companies, enterprises, telcos, cloud providers, that have the ability to choose best of breed and to combine them themselves in ways that solve the business challenges that they face. That said, there is a part of the marketed segment -- of the market that value out of the box converged architectures that include compute, storage, networking and the software automation stack on top of that. We have, in fact, been working with a number of different partners. So we probably have around a half a dozen right now, regional partners, that are working with Juniper as well as storage providers and compute providers to build those convert stack offerings. And they typically are very targeted to specific market verticals. So some might be targeted towards health care, others towards retail. And it's still early days.

And I'd like to kind of apply that question as well to your security business. Clearly, you've had 2 very good quarters. I'm just wondering how much of it is just a reflection of the fact that clients have been sitting on the sidelines. And now that you've refreshed a product, they're kind of updating architectures versus there are true new wins, new customer additions here. So if you can give us some color in the security, how much of the progress here is on your existing install base versus adding new customers, that will be great.

And we want to tap into that and we have been able to tap into that. It has been also just a big focus for me personally as part of the strategic initiative that I've laid out this year from the standpoint of partnerships, creating the partnerships and the commercial engine that we need to tap into the overall Enterprise opportunity, specifically as it relates to the cloud. In security, it really is a combination. In fact, there have been a few notable wins in the last couple of quarters that are net new. Having said that, I think there are also customers that have traditionally, like the SRX, especially the high-end SRX and the branch SRX that we are tapping into, that need to modernize their infrastructure and we're tapping into that as well. Again, we are not calling mission accomplished yet in security. There is a lot more work to do.

In terms of the tax rate, there was a lot of excitement in the tax rate commentary this quarter, which is not usual. So on the pro forma GAAP tax rate, we will expect a slightly reduced rate. Obviously, the R&D tax credit not being renewed has had an increase in our tax rate overall for the year. If that gets renewed, that can have close to a 2% tax rate adjustment.

When I look at the fundamentals of cloud, the need to build efficient wide area networks to connect the data centers together, to connect the data centers to the consumers of cloud services to peering point, it is all absolutely there and I don't anticipate that changing. So the long-term trajectory for this vertical, the cost [ph] vertical, I believe is actually healthy. And the products that we're building with the specific capabilities for this vertical, the capabilities in terms of visibility and manageability, controllability are well understood by Juniper. And we're developing our products with the intent of capturing the cloud opportunity in the future. Cable as well can be lumpy, it had been lumpy historically.
