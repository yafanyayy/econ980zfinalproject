Today I'm going to start with high-level summary of Gannett's strong performance in the fourth quarter. After that, Victoria will review the financial results of each of our segments, provide some detail on special items and review our balance sheet. Dave Lougee, President of Gannett Broadcasting, and Bob Dickey, President of U.S. Community Publishing, are also here at to participate in the Q&A session.
Now before we turn our results, I want to mention 1 other item contained in our earnings release this morning. For those of you who may not have seen it, we are reinstating our share repurchase program, which is funded entirely through free cash flow from operations. Our strong operating performance, as you saw this morning, and you'll hear more about in a moment, combined with our strong balance sheet have enabled us to resume the program well ahead of expectations. The buyback reflects our continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining the flexibility to invest in our businesses.
Now let's get to our earnings results. Our record-setting fourth quarter capped off a watershed year for Gannett, a year in which we achieved unprecedented revenue and levels in Broadcasting and Digital and tremendous margin growth propelled by strategic acquisitions, successful growth initiatives and continued strong cost discipline. Our full-year 2014 results reflect the successful execution of our plan to move into higher-growth, higher-margin businesses, and our fourth quarter results certainly attest to that.
Overall for the fourth quarter, company revenue increased 24%, driven by record revenue in both the Broadcasting and Digital Segments. On a pro forma basis, revenue grew 4%. These record-setting results in our Digital and Broadcasting Segments also drove substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA, which increased 57% over last year's fourth quarter to $511 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was substantially better in the fourth quarter, reaching 30%, over 6 percentage points better than the fourth quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share were $2.92 in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 55% year-over-year to $1.02.
We also kept expenses in check and continue to find and create efficiencies. Even with our acquisition of Cars.com, operating expense growth was well below revenue growth, up only about 18% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were actually about 3% lower than the fourth quarter in 2013. We are very pleased that even as we grow, we remain as lean and efficient as possible.
As I said, Broadcasting achieved record-breaking results. Revenue more than doubled. This growth was driven by the addition of the Belo stations and exceptional performances at our stations during the final push of the 2014 political season. Retransmission revenue growth has continued to be strong. The Broadcasting Segment had its best-ever political performance in a non-presidential year. Not only are there more dollars supporting the political advertising ecosystem, more importantly, Gannett is taking a greater share of those dollars with its larger footprint and its strong focus.
Gannett's markets covered the majority of key tossup senate and governor races across the country in states such as Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia and Michigan. Our stations also covered 10 active House races in Phoenix, Denver, St. Louis and San Antonio and others. Clearly, many crucial races were decided in Gannett markets, and our revenue, again, the highest political revenue we've ever achieved in a non-presidential year, certainly shows it. We have a very strong political footprint in any political year but especially in presidential election years. So 2016 promises to be another extraordinary year for us in that category.
Beyond numbers, a big development in the quarter with the renewal of affiliation agreements with all Gannett ABC stations. Importantly, the renewal combines our entire footprint, including the stations we acquired from Belo and London Broadcasting under 1 common long-term affiliation agreement. Also, through our integration of these additional stations, we are increasing operating efficiencies by applying our centralized services to those stations. The overall integration continues to outpace our expectations. As you'll recall, we projected $75 million in run rate synergies within the first year. We handily exceeded that number and are well ahead of schedule.
Digital also shattered records this quarter, growing revenues 77% year-over-year to $345 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Cars.com, but also strong organic growth at Cars as well as at CareerBuilder. Even on a pro forma basis, Digital segment revenues were up about 10% while operating expenses declined slightly. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved significantly compared to last year as a result an increase of over 8 percentage points to just over 30% for our Digital Segment.
As expected, Cars.com achieved dramatic growth this quarter, primarily due to higher rates charged affiliates but again, also to strong organic growth. So we're already seeing the benefits of that acquisition in major ways, and we're optimistic that revenue and profitability will stay above pre-acquisition levels.
Cars.com is already pursuing additional opportunities, some of which we mentioned at our Digital Investor Day. In January, Cars.com launched repair certified, its first program designed specifically  departments. In addition, the company is testing new sell and trade products that will ultimately help dealers acquire used inventory at a lower cost. So clearly, we are extending and maximizing Cars.com's expansive reach on an accelerated basis.
As you know, CareerBuilder is the other significant piece of our Digital Segment. CareerBuilder's North America revenue was up again this quarter, and we are also pleased to report that CareerBuilder continues to gain market share, which should positively impact our results in 2015.
Now most people know CareerBuilder as a leader among job,  but that's only part of the story. CareerBuilder is evolving into a global leader in human capital solutions, helping companies target and attract great talent by matching the right person to the right job at the right time. CareerBuilder has also built the only global pre-hire Software-as-a-Service platform that provides organizations with the most effective talent acquisition process. Its various software solutions distributes to multiple sources, build pipeline of passive candidates, equip recruiters with 1 place to search for candidates across all sources and provide the tools to effectively track and manage applicant flow that include labor market data and talent intelligence to inform decisions and optimize recruitment strategy. CareerBuilder's clients find all these tools incredibly useful, and the company's market share and revenue have been growing accordingly.
To give you some additional context on where we see this business going, human capital software solutions revenue increased 78% during the full year 2014 compared to 2013. 3 years ago, CareerBuilder Software-as-a-Service business represented only about 1% of total revenues. This past quarter, it accounted for 19% of total revenue. There's still a huge growth opportunity there. We believe that our progress to date is merely the tip of the iceberg.
Now let me switch gears for a moment to our local Digital Marketing Services business, G/O Digital, which had a tremendous quarter. Year-over-year, revenue from small- to medium-sized businesses increased 52% in the quarter, primarily bolstered by search and social products, which accounted for about 3/4 of the revenue. Baked into that revenue growth is also a 40% expansion of G/O Digital's customer base. This capped a full year 2014 that saw small- to medium-sized business revenue increase to 66%.
Looking at the past 2 years, revenue has more than tripled and average customer spend is up 14% over that time period. More customers, each spending more money, equates to strong performance by G/O Digital. We're pleased with the progress to date, but much more to come over the next 12 to 24 months.
Now the success in G/O Digital goes beyond the numbers. In 2014, Yahoo named G/O Digital a strategic local ambassador based on its success in helping entrepreneurs grow their small- and medium-sized businesses. We are also a Google Premier SMB Partner, and earlier this year, Blink Media launched a first-to-market social marketing product, Auto Lift, to enable auto brands, agencies and dealers to target in-market car shoppers with dynamic localized incentives on Facebook. Our Digital properties remain strong, and we're looking forward to more success in 2015.
Now moving on to our Publishing Segment. We continue to make key enhancements to our offerings that are helping us forge deeper connections with our audiences, our advertisers and our local communities on a broader scale. While we continue to face industry headwinds and operate in a challenging national advertising environment, we are pleased with our progress and the important enhancements we've made for consumers. Our USA TODAY local content editions have been even more successful than we could have imagined. The fourth quarter was our best in 2014 in terms of incremental revenue achieved by our local content initiative, and profitability has also improved as incremental expenses associated with it were lower. It is significantly beating our projections on both revenue and profitability, providing a significant boost.
The most exciting part of the USA Today local content story is that there is so much room for growth and expansion, and we are exploring syndication of this content as well. The Richmond Times Dispatch and the Arlington Heights Daily Herald now include USA TODAY content on Sundays, and we are having very productive conversations with other publishers as well. And just last week, we signed a deal with a publisher that will begin in early February in several markets and add approximately 130,000 in daily circulation over the next 6 months.
The bottom line is that the content is compelling and the demand for it is simply enormous. We fully intend to maintain the innovation that has driven the key initiatives such as the local content editions.
USA TODAY Sports also a number of key developments this year. Our for the wind grew page views by over 24% and we launched our college football fan index which combines social media activity and fan voting to determine the ultimate college football fan base. The success of all these new ventures highlights 2 of the key strengths of our Publishing leadership: innovation and execution. We've got an incredibly talented team here that is full of innovative creative ideas for leveraging the excellent journalism that is in Gannett's DNA. Equally as important, once they've got a promising project on the table, they know exactly how to get it done in a way that creates value for our audiences, our advertising partners and ultimately, our entire company.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Victoria, who will provide a detailed review of our financial results. Victoria?"

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. 2014 was truly an unprecedented year for Gannett by any measure as we continue to make outstanding progress in the strategic transformation of our company. Before I review our financial results as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which are included in our financials for the quarter to help provide additional context for our recurring performance trends.
Our ongoing operational efforts to transform the business continued to generate greater operating efficiencies and effectiveness across the portfolio again this quarter. These initiatives drove $52 million in workforce restructuring and other transformation charges across several of our businesses during the quarter. At the same time, in connection with an evaluation of expected future financial performance in some areas, we recognized $35 million in goodwill and intangible impairments during the quarter. These offering special items totaled $87 million, with an EPS impact of $0.25 per share.
From a nonoperating standpoint, we recorded income of $439 million and EPS benefit of $1.13 per share, primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining 73% of Classified Ventures during the quarter. As a result, we recorded a noncash gain to write up the 27% we already own to market value.
Additionally, our income tax for the quarter reflects a special $237 million benefit or $1.02 per share, primarily triggered by a restructure of the portfolio, which help offset higher gains in taxes to the sale of several TV stations, Apartments.com and other properties.
Now let's briefly review the ongoing revenue results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
Across the portfolio, as projected, total company revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year pro forma basis, primarily reflecting the strength of our Broadcast and Digital Segments. Again, this quarter, strong political advertising, spending and retransmission revenues contributed significantly to these results.
During the fourth quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.3 billion on a pro forma basis, excluding special items, were down 3% year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on efficiencies as well as lower volume in the Publishing Segment. Our efficiency programs included further consolidation of our printing and distribution platforms as well as our real estate footprint, the of our financial support organizations and streamlining of our customer service efforts.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of segment results.
Pro forma, Broadcast Segment revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, yet another historical high, benefited by strong retransmission fees, record non-presidential political advertising and Digital revenue. Political advertising spending of about $160 million for the full year, a historical high water mark for non-presidential political advertising revenues was even stronger than anticipated, by hotly contested campaigns. This was an increase of over 15% compared to 2010, the most recent non-presidential election year comparison.
Retransmission fees continue to grow substantially as well by nearly 60% on a pro forma basis as a result of  increases. That said, core advertising was lower due to displacement by significantly higher demand for political advertising, particularly in the latter part of the campaign season.
Broadcast Digital revenues were up 17%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction not only in the original Gannett stations but also in the newly acquired stations, which are now fully trained on G/O Digital products and seeing good results. Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014 to be up in the low to mid-single-digits despite challenging year-over-year comparisons. First quarter 2014 Broadcast revenue benefited fully $41 million related to the Winter Olympic Games and approximately $10 million from politically related ad demand. The challenge of overcoming these revenue contributions will be partially met in the first quarter of 2015 by Super Bowl advertising in the company's NBC stations.
During the quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 3% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven by expenses at our new and existing television station as well as reverse compensation and investments in sales and marketing tools.
Publishing Segment advertising revenues of $544 million were impacted by secular pressure again this quarter, down approximately 8% on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of sale of Apartments.com with the year-over-year print advertising revenue decline partly offset by Digital growth of 6%. Within the segment, domestic Publishing advertising revenues decreased by 9% year-over-year, although the auto, real estate and employment categories have improved throughout the year. We saw the first year-over-year increase in all of these categories in December, reflecting slight growth in the U.S. economy and the job market.
In the U.K. Newsquest advertising declined by 3% year-over-year in local currency. Pro forma, domestic online advertising revenue in the Publishing Segment increased 5% year-over-year, with retail advertising up 4%, driven by G/O Digital with a growing base of customers seeking to diversify their marketing efforts while increasing the efficiency of their online advertising solutions. National Digital revenues also improved 5%. Newsquest online advertising was up a robust 19% driven by retail and employment category advertising.
Publishing Segment circulation revenue continued to be strengthened by the all-access content subscription model, local USA TODAY content contribution and strategic price increases at our , which reported their second consecutive quarterly increase this year. This was offset by the cycling of cover price increases at Newsquest as well as lower USA TODAY group print circulation, resulting at a total circulation revenue decline of 2% for the fourth quarter.
Publishing Segment operating expenses were below last year, down 5% due to cost reductions and efficiency gains generated by Gannett Publishing Services and sourcing initiatives as well as lower volume.
Publishing Segment operating income was $125 million in the quarter. Within the Publishing Segment, changes in the Cars.com affiliate agreements and the absence of Cars.com revenue had an unfavorable impact of approximately $9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, Digital segment revenue increased by 10% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, a record high driven by the addition of Cars.com, up 25%, and continued growth at CareerBuilder, which was also up 4% year-over-year. The strong Cars.com results reflect a new affiliate agreement economics as well as organic growth in Cars.com direct markets. These [indiscernible] markets, which accounts for about 80% of total revenues generated by the Cars.com direct sales force, increased by 20% during the quarter. Also, strongly contributing to the Digital Segment this quarter, CareerBuilder growth continues to be driven by expanding sales of human capital software-as-a-solution products.
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 1% on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead acquisition costs and revenue share page to affiliate markets at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at CareerBuilder, which were lower by 2% year-over-year.
During the fourth quarter, company-wide Digital revenues totaled almost $540 million, reflecting an increase of 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Digital revenues contributed fully 32% of total company revenues during the quarter, another historical high for Gannett.
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $511 million increased by 27% on a pro forma basis, with year-over-year gains driven by both Broadcast and Digital Segments, which generated nearly 75% of total company-wide EBITDA.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, 32% higher than last year due to our strong operating results.
During the quarter, we invested nearly $60 million in capital projects primarily related to several local Publishing real estate initiatives and ongoing digital product development as well as product integration and enhancements at CareerBuilder and Cars.com. As projected, we invested over $160 million of capital during 2014 with the majority of our investments dedicated to development of digital products and platforms.
With the completion of $675 million senior debt financing for Cars.com, our long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $5.5 million with $118 billion [ph] of cash in the balance sheet. The ending debt balance is substantially lower than expected due to cash back savings I previously detailed as well as strong cash from operations.
During the fourth quarter, interest expense was $74 million, largely driven by the debt associated with the acquisition of Belo and Cars.com.
During 2014, we were able to return almost $260 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase despite the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Since the time we announced the current buyback program in July of 2013, we have completed over 50% of our $300 million commitment, with 5.6 million shares repurchased at an average price of $27.03 per share.
As you've heard, we are looking forward to 2015 as a year of great opportunity across a variety of venues within our portfolio of businesses. We anticipate a very strong year of Cars.com results, which we project to be accretive to free cash flow by approximately $0.43 a share and neutral to EPS for the year.
Naturally, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the cyclical absence of record political advertising as well as significant Olympics revenue compared to 2014 which, when combined, totaled $200 million. In addition, in 2015, we project higher expenses related to reverse compensation under the terms of our contractual commitments. Retransmission revenue is expected to be in the range of $440 million to $445 million. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, about $25 million lower than in 2014 as a result of fewer remaining real estate projects.  Is projected to increase to approximately $210 million to $15 million in 2015, including the impact of the Cars.com acquisition. Amortization is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, also impacted by the Cars.com acquisition.
As discussed in December at the UBS conference, we anticipate the new pension mortality tables will negatively impact pension expense this year. We'll continue to update you as this gets refined.
In keeping with the prior year, the 2015 tax rate is projected to be approximately 32%.
Overall, we're very pleased with our continued progress reflected in our 2014 financial results. As we execute on our separation into 2 strong publicly traded companies midyear, we continue to see significant opportunities in the horizon and look forward to sharing those with you.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks prior to the Q&A."

And while we're on the topic of the separation and before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the letter we received last month from Carl Icahn stating his intention to nominate 2 candidates for election to our board and to submit nonbinding corporate at Gannett and the post-spin Publishing company. Mr. Icahn attempt to dictate at Gannett, let alone at a new company that has not yet been established and governance profile as yet to be determined, frankly, is overreaching. We have an experienced board that has been a driving force behind the successful execution of our strategy. Our corporate governance is shareholder-friendly today at Gannett, and there is no reason to think it won't be at the new Publishing company. The board, of course, will evaluate Mr. Icahn governance proposals and his director nominees through the lens of what is best for all of our shareholders. And that's all I'll say about this today.
The spin-off is on track, and we expect to file our Form 10 sometime in March. With that, why don't we turn it over to Kyla for questions. Thank you."

And I think what we saw in the fourth quarter, particularly at USA TODAY where they're a great platform, for instance, for new car launches or product changes, some of those were deferred into the first quarter. And I think that, that led to a bit of an exacerbation of national numbers that we saw at USA TODAY. I think what we're looking at, as I look into the first quarter and we've got an early, early blusher on what we think things are looking at, we should see improvement on the national advertising side because I think we'll start to see some of that auto advertising that was delayed in the fourth quarter actually starting to pick up. We had a lovely wrap on USA TODAY yesterday from Jeep Chrysler. So pleased to see that obviously. I'd say overall in the Publishing side, again, early. But what we're looking at looks like what will be total revenue for Publishing probably better by a percentage point or so in the first quarter. And it looks like total advertising revenues will be better by potentially a couple of percentage points in the first quarter.

But one of the benefits of -- after the spin, we will have 2 companies that will have fantastic balance sheets. Publishing will have virtually no debt. Broadcasting even levered the way we anticipate with all the debt going there. As you saw, our debt level was lower year end by a couple of hundred million. So we thought so we generated an enormous amount of free cash flow. We'll be able to pay down debt, et cetera. So we still have a lot of opportunity there to do great opportunistic acquisitions. We have an appetite to do them to expand where we can on a very disciplined basis. And I think the Belo transaction, the Cars transaction are great testaments to the fact that when we see an opportunity where we believe that we can bring a lot of value and realize that value very directly, then we are prepared to act in a meaningful way. So I think that we are very open to opportunities -- further tuck-in opportunities, certainly at least on the broadcast side, also on the Digital side. As Cars.com continues to evolve its product suite and continues to meet the needs of its client, to the extent that there are opportunities to look at some fill-ins and some expanding of some of the things that we're doing there, then that's obviously something that we will pay a lot of good attention to. I know Bob is -- I think we're also blessed with not only having a fantastic balance sheet. But we also have some of the best operators, if not the best operators, in both of those companies. And so Bob's ability to bring the incredible innovation that his team and he have brought around revenue as well as the strong cost discipline that we have there, I think leads us to believe that there may be opportunities obviously to consolidate some of the properties there. But again, always being very careful and making sure that what we're going to do is create shareholder value with any opportunity that we look at. But I think you're absolutely right. There are going to be lots of companies for all companies and we will be very careful stewards of our capital and make sure that in both companies there is a direct return of some capital, but there's also other opportunities to invest in growth opportunities.

For those of you who may not have seen it, we are reinstating our share repurchase program, which is funded entirely through free cash flow from operations. Our strong operating performance, as you saw this morning, and you'll hear more about in a moment, combined with our strong balance sheet, have enabled us to resume the program well ahead of expectations. The buyback reflects our continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in our businesses.
Now let's get to our earnings results. Our record-setting fourth quarter capped off a watershed year for Gannett, a year in which we achieved unprecedented revenue and NIBT levels in Broadcasting and Digital, and tremendous margin growth propelled by strategic acquisitions, successful growth initiatives and continued strong cost discipline. Our full-year 2014 results reflect the successful execution of our plan to move into higher-growth, higher-margin businesses, and our fourth quarter results certainly attest to that.
Overall for the fourth quarter, company revenue increased 24%, driven by record revenue in both the Broadcasting and Digital Segments. On a pro forma basis, revenue grew 4%. These record-setting results in our Digital and Broadcasting Segments also drove substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA, which increased 57% over last year's fourth quarter, to $511 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was substantially better in the fourth quarter, reaching 30%, over 6 percentage points better than the fourth quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share were $2.92 in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 55% year-over-year to $1.02.
We also kept expenses in check and continue to find and create efficiencies. Even with our acquisition of Cars.com, operating expense growth was well below revenue growth, up only about 18% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were actually about 3% lower than the fourth quarter in 2013. We are very pleased that even as we grow, we remain as lean and efficient as possible.
As I said, Broadcasting achieved record-breaking results. Revenue more than doubled. This growth was driven by the addition of the Belo stations and exceptional performances at our stations during the final push of the 2014 political season. Retransmission revenue growth has continued to be strong. The Broadcasting Segment had its best-ever political performance in a non-presidential year. Not only are there more dollars supporting the political advertising ecosystem, more importantly, Gannett is taking a greater share of those dollars with its larger footprint and its strong focus.
Gannett's markets covered the majority of key tossup senate and governor races across the country in states such as Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia and Michigan. Our stations also covered 10 active House races in Phoenix, Denver, St. Louis and San Antonio and others. Clearly, many crucial races were decided in Gannett markets, and our revenue, again, the highest political revenue we've ever achieved in a non-presidential year, certainly shows it. We have a very strong political footprint in any political year, but especially in presidential election years. So 2016 promises to be another extraordinary year for us in that category.
Beyond numbers, a big development in the quarter, with the renewal of affiliation agreements with all Gannett ABC stations. Importantly, the renewal combines our entire footprint, including the stations we acquired from Belo and London Broadcasting under one common long-term affiliation agreement. Also, through our integration of these additional stations, we are increasing operating efficiencies by applying our centralized services to those stations. The overall integration continues to outpace our expectations. As you'll recall, we projected $75 million in run rate synergies within the first year. We handily exceeded that number and are well ahead of schedule.
Digital also shattered records this quarter, growing revenues 77% year-over-year to $345 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Cars.com, but also strong organic growth at Cars, as well as at CareerBuilder. Even on a pro forma basis, Digital segment revenues were up about 10%, while operating expenses declined slightly. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved significantly compared to last year, as a result, an increase of over 8 percentage points to just over 30% for our Digital Segment.
As expected, Cars.com achieved dramatic growth this quarter, primarily due to higher rates charged to affiliates, but again, also to strong organic growth. So we're already seeing the benefits of that acquisition in major ways, and we're optimistic that revenue and profitability will stay well above pre-acquisition levels.
Cars.com is already pursuing additional opportunities, some of which we mentioned at our Digital Investor Day. In January, Cars.com launched RepairPal-certified, its first program designed specifically to help differentiate dealership service departments. In addition, the company is testing new sell and trade products that will ultimately help dealers acquire used inventory at a lower cost. So clearly, we are extending and maximizing Cars.com's expansive reach on an accelerated basis.
As you know, CareerBuilder is the other significant piece of our Digital Segment. CareerBuilder's North America revenue was up again this quarter, and we are also pleased to report that CareerBuilder continues to gain market share, which should positively impact our results in 2015.
Now most people know CareerBuilder as a leader among job boards, but that's only part of the story. CareerBuilder is evolving into a global leader in human capital solutions, helping companies target and attract great talent, by matching the right person to the right job at the right time. CareerBuilder has also built the only global pre-hire Software-as-a-Service platform that provides organizations with the most effective talent acquisition process. Its various software solutions distribute jobs to multiple sources, build pipelines of passive candidates, equip recruiters with one place to search for candidates across all sources, and provide the tools to effectively track and manage applicant flow that include labor market data and talent intelligence to informed decisions and optimize recruitment strategy. CareerBuilder's clients find all these tools incredibly useful, and the company's market share and revenue have been growing accordingly.
To give you some additional context on where we see this business going, human capital software solutions revenue increased 78% during the full year 2014 compared to 2013. 3 years ago, CareerBuilder's Software-as-a-Service business represented only about 1% of total revenues. This past quarter, it accounted for 19% of total revenue. There's still a huge growth opportunity there. We believe that our progress to date is merely the tip of the iceberg.
Now let me switch gears for a moment to our local Digital Marketing Services business, G/O Digital, which had a tremendous quarter. Year-over-year, revenue from small- to medium-sized businesses increased 52% in the quarter, primarily bolstered by search and social products, which accounted for about 3/4 of the revenue. Baked into that revenue growth is also a 40% expansion of G/O Digital's customer base. This capped a full year 2014 that saw small- to medium-sized business revenue increase to 66%.
Looking at the past 2 years, revenue has more than tripled and average customer spend is up 14% over that time period. More customers, each spending more money, equates to strong performance by G/O Digital. We're pleased with the progress to date, but much more to come over the next 12 to 24 months.
Now the success in G/O Digital goes beyond the numbers. In 2014, Yahoo named G/O Digital a strategic local ambassador based on its success in helping entrepreneurs grow their small- and medium-sized businesses. We are also a Google Premier SMB Partner, and earlier this year, BLiNQ Media launched a first-to-market social marketing product, AutoLiFT, to enable auto brands, agencies and dealers to target in-market car shoppers with dynamic localized incentives on Facebook. Our Digital properties remain strong, and we're looking forward to more success in 2015.
Now moving on to our Publishing Segment. We continue to make key enhancements to our offerings that are helping us forge deeper connections with our audiences, our advertisers and our local communities on a broader scale. While we continue to face industry headwinds and operate in a challenging national advertising environment, we are pleased with our progress and the important enhancements we've made for consumers. 
Our USA TODAY local content editions have been even more successful than we could have imagined. The fourth quarter was our best in 2014 in terms of incremental revenue achieved by our local content initiative, and profitability has also improved, as incremental expenses associated with it were lower. It is significantly beating our projections on both revenue and profitability, providing a significant boost.
The most exciting part of the USA TODAY local content story is that there is so much room for growth and expansion, and we are exploring syndication of this content as well. The Richmond Times-Dispatch and the Arlington Heights Daily Herald now include USA TODAY content on Sundays, and we are having very productive conversations with other publishers as well. And just last week, we signed a deal with a publisher that will begin in early February in several markets and add approximately 130,000 in daily circulation over the next 6 months.
The bottom line is that the content is compelling and the demand for it is simply enormous. We fully intend to maintain the innovation that has driven key initiatives such as the local content editions.
USA TODAY Sports also celebrated a number of key developments this year. Our For The Win social sports site grew page views by over 24% and we launched our college football fan index, which combines social media activity and fan voting to determine the ultimate college football fan base. 
The success of all these new ventures highlights 2 of the key strengths of our Publishing leadership: innovation and execution. We've got an incredibly talented team here that is full of innovative creative ideas for leveraging the excellent journalism that is in Gannett's DNA. Equally as important, once they've got a promising project on the table, they know exactly how to get it done in a way that creates value for our audiences, our advertising partners and ultimately, our entire company.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Victoria, who'll provide a detailed review of our financial results. Victoria?"
20571,282857707,753647,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. 2014 was truly an unprecedented year for Gannett by any measure, as we continued to make outstanding progress in the",1786,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. 2014 was truly an unprecedented year for Gannett by any measure, as we continued to make outstanding progress in the strategic transformation of our company. Before I review our financial results, as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which are included in our financials for the quarter, to help provide additional context for our recurring performance trends.
Our ongoing operational efforts to transform the business continued to generate greater operating efficiencies and effectiveness across the portfolio again this quarter. These initiatives drove $52 million in workforce restructuring and other transformation charges across several of our businesses during the quarter. At the same time, in connection with an evaluation of expected future financial performance in some areas, we recognized $35 million in goodwill and intangible impairments during the quarter. These operating special items totaled $87 million, with an EPS impact of $0.25 per share.
From a nonoperating standpoint, we recorded income of $439 million, an EPS benefit of $1.13 per share, primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining 73% of Classified Ventures during the quarter. As a result, we recorded a noncash gain to write up the 27% we already own to market value.
Additionally, our income tax for the quarter reflects a special $237 million benefit or $1.02 per share, primarily triggered by a restructuring of the portfolio, which help to offset prior gains and taxes related to the sale of several TV stations, Apartments.com and other properties.
Now let's briefly review the ongoing revenue results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
Across the portfolio, as projected, total company revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily reflecting the strength of our Broadcast and Digital Segments. Again, this quarter, strong political advertising, spending and retransmission revenues contributed significantly to these results.
During the fourth quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.3 billion on a pro forma basis, excluding special items, were down 3% year-over-year, as a result of our continued focus on efficiencies as well as lower volume in the Publishing Segment. Our efficiency programs included further consolidation of our printing and distribution platforms, as well as our real estate footprint, the hubbing of our financial support organizations and streamlining of our customer service efforts.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of segment results. Pro forma, Broadcast Segment revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, yet another historical high, benefited by strong retransmission fees, record non-presidential political advertising and Digital revenue. Political advertising spending of about $160 million for the full year, a historical high water mark for non-presidential political advertising revenues, was even stronger than anticipated, buoyed by several hotly contested campaigns. This was an increase of over 15% compared to 2010, the most recent non-presidential election year comparison.
Retransmission fees continue to grow substantially as well by nearly 60% on a pro forma basis, as a result of freight increases. That said, core advertising was lower due to displacement by significantly higher demand for political advertising, particularly in the latter part of the campaign season.
Broadcast Digital revenues were up 17%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction, not only in the original Gannett stations but also in the newly acquired stations, which are now fully trained on G/O Digital products and seeing good results. Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014 to be up in the low- to mid-single digits, despite challenging year-over-year comparisons. 
First quarter 2014 Broadcast revenue benefited fully $41 million related to the Winter Olympic Games and approximately $10 million from politically-related ad demand. The challenge of overcoming these even-year revenue contributions will be partially met in the first quarter of 2015 by Super Bowl advertising in the company's NBC stations.
During the quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 3% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven by expenses associated with revenue growth initiatives at our new and existing television stations, as well as reverse compensation and investments in sales and marketing tools.
Publishing Segment advertising revenues of $544 million were impacted by secular pressure again this quarter, down approximately 8% on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of the sale of Apartments.com, with the year-over-year print advertising revenue decline partly offset by Digital growth of 6%. Within this segment, domestic Publishing advertising revenues decreased by 9% year-over-year, although the auto, real estate and employment categories have improved throughout the year. We saw the first year-over-year increase in all of these categories in December, reflecting slight growth in U.S. economy and the job markets.
In the U.K. Newsquest advertising declined by 3% year-over-year in local currency. Pro forma, domestic online advertising revenue in the Publishing Segment increased 5% year-over-year, with retail advertising up 4%, driven by G/O Digital, with a growing base of customers seeking to diversify their marketing efforts, while increasing the efficiency of their online advertising solutions. National Digital revenues also improved 5%. Newsquest online advertising was up a robust 19% driven by retail and employment category advertising.
Publishing Segment circulation revenue continued to be strengthened by the all-access content subscription model, local USA TODAY content contribution and strategic price increases in our local U.S. publishing sites, which reported their second consecutive quarterly increase this year. This is offset by the cycling of cover price increases at Newsquest, as well as lower USA TODAY group print circulation, resulting at a total circulation revenue decline of 2% for the fourth quarter.
Publishing Segment operating expenses were below last year, down 5%, due to cost reductions and efficiency gains generated by Gannett Publishing Services and sourcing initiatives, as well as lower volume.
Publishing Segment operating income was $125 million in the quarter. Within the Publishing Segment, changes in the Cars.com affiliate agreements and the absence of Cars.com revenue had an unfavorable impact of approximately $9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, Digital segment revenue increased by 10% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, a record high driven by the addition of Cars.com, up 25%, and continued growth at CareerBuilder, which was also up 4% year-over-year. The strong Cars.com results reflect a new affiliate agreement economics, as well as organic growth in Cars.com direct markets. 
These reflect [ph] markets, which account for about 80% of total revenues generated by the Cars.com direct sales force, increased by 20% during the quarter. Also, strongly contributing to the Digital Segment this quarter, CareerBuilder growth continues to be driven by expanding sales of human capital software-as-a-solution products.
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 1% on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead acquisition cost and revenue share page to affiliate markets at Cars.com, as well as cost efficiencies at CareerBuilder, which were lower by 2% year-over-year.
During the fourth quarter, company-wide Digital revenues totaled almost $540 million, reflecting an increase of 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Digital revenues contributed fully 32% of total company revenues during the quarter, another historical high for Gannett.
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $511 million increased by 27% on a pro forma basis, with year-over-year gains driven by both Broadcast and Digital Segments, which generated nearly 75% of total company-wide EBITDA. Free cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, 32% higher than last year due to our strong operating results.
During the quarter, we invested nearly $60 million in capital projects, primarily related to several local Publishing real estate initiatives and ongoing digital product development, as well as product integration and enhancements at CareerBuilder and Cars.com. As projected, we invested over $160 million of capital during 2014, with the majority of our investments dedicated to development of digital products and platforms.
With the completion of $675 million senior debt financing for Cars.com, our long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, with $118 million of cash on the balance sheet. The ending debt balance is substantially lower than expected due to cash tax savings I previously detailed, as well as strong cash from operations.
During the fourth quarter, interest expense was $74 million, largely driven by the debt associated with the acquisition of Belo and Cars.com.
During 2014, we were able to return almost $260 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase despite the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Since the time we announced the current buyback program in July of 2013, we have completed over 50% of our $300 million commitment, with 5.6 million shares repurchased at an average price of $27.03 per share.
As you've heard, we are looking forward to 2015 as a year of great opportunity, across a variety of venues within our portfolio of businesses. We anticipate a very strong year of Cars.com results, which we project to be accretive to free cash flow by approximately $0.43 a share and neutral to EPS for the year.
Naturally, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the cyclical absence of record political advertising, as well as significant Olympics revenue compared to 2014, which when combined, totaled $200 million. 
In addition, in 2015, we project higher expenses related to reverse compensation under the terms of our contractual commitments. Retransmission revenue is expected to be in the range of $440 million to $445 million. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, about $25 million lower than in 2014, as a result of fewer remaining real estate projects.  
Depreciation is projected to increase to approximately $210 million to $215 million in 2015, including the impact of the Cars.com acquisition. Amortization is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, also impacted by the Cars.com acquisition.
As discussed in December at the UBS Conference, we anticipate the new pension mortality tables will negatively impact pension expense this year. We'll continue to update you as this gets refined. In keeping with the prior year, the 2015 tax rate is projected to be approximately 32%.
Overall, we're very pleased with our continued progress reflected in our 2014 financial results. As we execute on our separation into 2 strong publicly traded companies midyear, we continue to see significant opportunities on the horizon and look forward to sharing those with you.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks, prior to the Q&A."

The success we've achieved over the last few years has been built upon a strong foundation of our purpose, disciplined financial stewardship, shareholder focused and board and management accountability. As we iron out the specifics of the 2 independent companies following the separation, we are committed to instilling the same kind of strong foundation at both industry-leading companies, ensuring that they are each best positioned in every way for future growth and success.
And while we're on the topic of the separation and before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the letter we received last month from Carl Icahn, stating his intention to nominate 2 candidates for election to our board and to submit nonbinding corporate governance proposals at Gannett and at the post-spin Publishing company. Mr. Icahn's attempt to dictate corporate governance at Gannett, let alone at a new company that has not yet been established and whose governance profile has yet to be determined, frankly, is overreaching. 
We have an experienced board that has been a driving force behind the successful execution of our strategy. Our corporate governance is shareholder-friendly today at Gannett, and there is no reason to think it won't be at the new Publishing company. The board, of course, will evaluate Mr. Icahn's governance proposals and his director nominees through the lens of what is best for all of our shareholders. And that's all I'll say about this today.
The spin-off is on track, and we expect to file our Form 10 sometime in March. With that, why don't we turn it over to Kayla, for questions. Thank you."

And I think what we saw in the fourth quarter, particularly at USA TODAY, where they're a great platform, for instance, for new car launches or product changes, some of those were deferred into the first quarter. And I think that, that led to a bit of an exacerbation of national numbers that we saw at USA TODAY. I think what we're looking at, as I look into the first quarter and we've gotten an early, early blush on what we think things are looking at, we should see improvement on the national advertising side because I think we'll start to see some of that auto advertising that was delayed in the fourth quarter actually starting to pick up. We had a lovely wrap on USA TODAY yesterday from Jeep Chrysler. So pleased to see that, obviously. I'd say, overall, in the Publishing side, again, early. But what we're looking at looks like it will be total revenue for Publishing, probably better by a percentage point or so in the first quarter. And it looks like total advertising revenues will be better by potentially a couple of percentage points in the first quarter. So I think we just had some interesting things going on in the fourth quarter that, at least early in the first quarter, we are seeing expectations of improvement over."

But one of the benefits of -- after the spin, we will have 2 companies that will have fantastic balance sheets. Publishing will have virtually no debt. Broadcasting even levered the way we anticipate, with all the debt going there. As you saw, our debt level was lower year end by a couple of hundred million than we thought. So we generated an enormous amount of free cash flow. We'll be able to pay down debt, et cetera. So we still have a lot of opportunity there to do great opportunistic acquisitions. We have an appetite to do them, to expand where we can on a very disciplined basis. And I think the Belo transaction, the Cars transaction, are great testaments to the fact that when we see an opportunity where we believe that we can bring a lot of value and realize that value very directly, then we are prepared to act in a meaningful way. So I think that we are very open to opportunities -- further tuck-in opportunities, certainly at least on the broadcast side, also on the Digital side. As Cars.com continues to evolve its product suite and continues to meet the needs of its clients, to the extent that there are opportunities to look at some fill-ins or some expanding of some of the things that we're doing there, then that's obviously something that we will pay a lot of good attention to. I know Bob is -- I think we're also blessed with not only having fantastic balance sheet. But we also have some of the best operators, if not the best operators in both of those companies. And so Bob's ability to bring the incredible innovation that his team and he have brought around revenue, as well as the strong cost discipline that we have there, I think leads us to believe that there may be opportunities obviously to consolidate some of the properties there. But again, always being very careful and making sure that what we're going to do is create shareholder value with any opportunity that we look at. But I think you're absolutely right, there are going to be lots of opportunities for both companies, and we will be very careful stewards of our capital and make sure that in both companies there is a direct return of some capital, but there's also other opportunities to invest in growth opportunities."

Dave Lougee, President of Gannett Broadcasting; and Bob Dickey, President of U.S. Community Publishing, are also here at to participate in the Q&A session.
Now before we turn to our results, I want to mention one other item contained in our earnings release this morning. For those of you who may not have seen it, we are reinstating our share repurchase program, which is funded entirely through free cash flow from operations. Our strong operating performance, as you saw this morning, and you'll hear more about in a moment, combined with our strong balance sheet, have enabled us to resume the program well ahead of expectations. The buyback reflects our continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in our businesses.
Now let's get to our earnings results. Our record-setting fourth quarter capped off a watershed year for Gannett, a year in which we achieved unprecedented revenue and NIBT levels in Broadcasting and Digital, and tremendous margin growth propelled by strategic acquisitions, successful growth initiatives and continued strong cost discipline. Our full-year 2014 results reflect the successful execution of our plan to move into higher-growth, higher-margin businesses, and our fourth quarter results certainly attest to that.
Overall for the fourth quarter, company revenue increased 24%, driven by record revenue in both the Broadcasting and Digital Segments. On a pro forma basis, revenue grew 4%. These record-setting results in our Digital and Broadcasting Segments also drove substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA, which increased 57% over last year's fourth quarter, to $511 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was substantially better in the fourth quarter, reaching 30%, over 6 percentage points better than the fourth quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share were $2.92 in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 55% year-over-year to $1.02.
We also kept expenses in check and continued to find and create efficiencies. Even with our acquisition of Cars.com, operating expense growth was well below revenue growth, up only about 18% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were actually about 3% lower than the fourth quarter in 2013. We are very pleased that even as we grow, we remain as lean and efficient as possible.
As I said, Broadcasting achieved record-breaking results. Revenue more than doubled. This growth was driven by the addition of the Belo stations and exceptional performances at our stations during the final push of the 2014 political season. Retransmission revenue growth has continued to be strong. The Broadcasting Segment had its best ever political performance in a non-presidential year. Not only are there more dollars supporting the political advertising ecosystem, more importantly, Gannett is taking a greater share of those dollars with its larger footprint and its strong focus.
Gannett's markets covered the majority of key tossup senate and governor races across the country in states such as Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia and Michigan. Our stations also covered 10 active House races in Phoenix, Denver, St. Louis and San Antonio and others. Clearly, many crucial races were decided in Gannett markets, and our revenue, again, the highest political revenue we've ever achieved in a non-presidential year, certainly shows it. We have a very strong political footprint in any political year, but especially in presidential election years. So 2016 promises to be another extraordinary year for us in that category.
Beyond numbers, a big development in the quarter was the renewal of affiliation agreements with all Gannett ABC stations. Importantly, the renewal combines our entire footprint, including the stations we acquired from Belo and London Broadcasting under one common long-term affiliation agreement. Also, through our integration of these additional stations, we are increasing operating efficiencies by applying our centralized services to those stations. The overall integration continues to outpace our expectations. As you'll recall, we projected $75 million in run rate synergies within the first year. We handily exceeded that number and are well ahead of schedule.
Digital also shattered records this quarter, growing revenues 77% year-over-year to $345 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Cars.com, but also strong organic growth at Cars, as well as at CareerBuilder. Even on a pro forma basis, Digital segment revenues were up about 10%, while operating expenses declined slightly. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved significantly compared to last year. As a result, an increase of over 8 percentage points to just over 30% for our Digital Segment.
As expected, Cars.com achieved dramatic growth this quarter, primarily due to higher rates charged to affiliates, but again, also to strong organic growth. So we're already seeing the benefits of that acquisition in major ways, and we're optimistic that revenue and profitability will stay well above pre-acquisition levels.
Cars.com is already pursuing additional opportunities, some of which we mentioned at our Digital Investor Day. In January, Cars.com launched RepairPal-certified, its first program designed specifically to help differentiate dealership service departments. In addition, the company is testing new sell and trade products that will ultimately help dealers acquire used inventory at a lower cost. So clearly, we are extending and maximizing Cars.com's expansive reach on an accelerated basis.
As you know, CareerBuilder is the other significant piece of our Digital Segment. CareerBuilder's North America revenue was up again this quarter, and we are also pleased to report that CareerBuilder continues to gain market share, which should positively impact our results in 2015.
Now most people know CareerBuilder as a leader among job boards, but that's only part of the story. CareerBuilder is evolving into a global leader in human capital solutions, helping companies target and attract great talent, by matching the right person to the right job at the right time. CareerBuilder has also built the only global pre-hire Software-as-a-Service platform that provides organizations with the most effective talent acquisition process. Its various software solutions distribute jobs to multiple sources, build pipelines of passive candidates, equip recruiters with one place to search for candidates across all sources, and provide the tools to effectively track and manage applicant flow that include labor market data and talent intelligence to informed decisions and optimize recruitment strategy. CareerBuilder's clients find all these tools incredibly useful, and the company's market share and revenue have been growing accordingly.
To give you some additional context on where we see this business going, human capital software solutions revenue increased 78% during the full year 2014 compared to 2013. 3 years ago, CareerBuilder's Software-as-a-Service business represented only about 1% of total revenues. This past quarter, it accounted for 19% of total revenue. There's still a huge growth opportunity there. We believe that our progress to date is merely the tip of the iceberg.
Now let me switch gears for a moment to our local Digital Marketing Services business, G/O Digital, which had a tremendous quarter. Year-over-year, revenue from small- to medium-sized businesses increased 52% in the quarter, primarily bolstered by search and social products, which accounted for about 3/4 of the revenue. Baked into that revenue growth is also a 40% expansion of G/O Digital's customer base. This capped a full year 2014 that saw small- to medium-sized business revenue increase to [ph] 66%.
Looking at the past 2 years, revenue has more than tripled and average customer spend is up 14% over that time period. More customers, each spending more money, equates to strong performance by G/O Digital. We're pleased with the progress to date, but much more to come over the next 12 to 24 months.
Now the success in G/O Digital goes beyond the numbers. In 2014, Yahoo named G/O Digital a strategic local ambassador based on its success in helping entrepreneurs grow their small- and medium-sized businesses. We are also a Google Premier SMB Partner, and earlier this year, BLiNQ Media launched a first-to-market social marketing product, AutoLiFT, to enable auto brands, agencies and dealers to target in-market car shoppers with dynamic localized incentives on Facebook. Our Digital Properties remain strong, and we're looking forward to more success in 2015.
Now moving on to our Publishing Segment. We continue to make key enhancements to our offerings that are helping us forge deeper connections with our audiences, our advertisers and our local communities on a broader scale. While we continue to face industry headwinds and operate in a challenging national advertising environment, we are pleased with our progress and the important enhancements we've made for consumers. 
Our USA TODAY local content editions have been even more successful than we could have imagined. The fourth quarter was our best in 2014 in terms of incremental revenue achieved by our local content initiative, and profitability has also improved, as incremental expenses associated with it were lower. It is significantly beating our projections on both revenue and profitability, providing a significant boost.
The most exciting part of the USA TODAY local content story is that there is so much room for growth and expansion, and we are exploring syndication of this content as well. The Richmond Times-Dispatch and the Arlington Heights Daily Herald now include USA TODAY content on Sundays, and we are having very productive conversations with other publishers as well. And just last week, we signed a deal with a publisher that will begin in early February in several markets and add approximately 130,000 in daily circulation over the next 6 months.
The bottom line is that the content is compelling and the demand for it is simply enormous. We fully intend to maintain the innovation that has driven key initiatives such as the local content editions.
USA TODAY Sports also celebrated a number of key developments this year. Our For The Win social sports site grew page views by over 24% and we launched our college football fan index, which combines social media activity and fan voting to determine the ultimate college football fan base. 
The success of all these new ventures highlights 2 of the key strengths of our Publishing leadership: innovation and execution. We've got an incredibly talented team here that is full of innovative creative ideas for leveraging the excellent journalism that is in Gannett's DNA. Equally as important, once they've got a promising project on the table, they know exactly how to get it done in a way that creates value for our audiences, our advertising partners and ultimately, our entire company.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Victoria, who'll provide a detailed review of our financial results. Victoria?"
20571,282857707,753733,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. 2014 was truly an unprecedented year for Gannett by any measure, as we continued to make outstanding progress in the",1786,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. 2014 was truly an unprecedented year for Gannett by any measure, as we continued to make outstanding progress in the strategic transformation of our company. Before I review our financial results, as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which are included in our financials for the quarter, to help provide additional context for our recurring performance trends.
Our ongoing operational efforts to transform the business continued to generate greater operating efficiencies and effectiveness across the portfolio again this quarter. These initiatives drove $52 million in workforce restructuring and other transformation charges across several of our businesses during the quarter. At the same time, in connection with an evaluation of expected future financial performance in some areas, we recognized $35 million in goodwill and intangible impairments during the quarter. These operating special items totaled $87 million, with an EPS impact of $0.25 per share.
From a nonoperating standpoint, we recorded income of $439 million, an EPS benefit of $1.13 per share, primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining 73% of Classified Ventures during the quarter. As a result, we recorded a noncash gain to write up the 27% we already own to market value.
Additionally, our income tax for the quarter reflects a special $237 million benefit or $1.02 per share, primarily triggered by a restructuring of the portfolio, which help to offset prior gains and taxes related to the sale of several TV stations, Apartments.com and other properties.
Now let's briefly review the ongoing revenue results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
Across the portfolio, as projected, total company revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily reflecting the strength of our Broadcast and Digital Segments. Again, this quarter, strong political advertising, spending and retransmission revenues contributed significantly to these results.
During the fourth quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.3 billion on a pro forma basis, excluding special items, were down 3% year-over-year, as a result of our continued focus on efficiencies as well as lower volume in the Publishing Segment. Our efficiency programs included further consolidation of our printing and distribution platforms, as well as our real estate footprint, the hubbing of our financial support organizations and streamlining of our customer service efforts.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of segment results. Pro forma, Broadcast Segment revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, yet another historical high, benefited by strong retransmission fees, record non-presidential political advertising and Digital revenue. Political advertising spending of about $160 million for the full year, a historical high water mark for non-presidential political advertising revenues, was even stronger than anticipated, buoyed by several hotly contested campaigns. This was an increase of over 15% compared to 2010, the most recent non-presidential election year comparison.
Retransmission fees continue to grow substantially as well by nearly 60% on a pro forma basis, as a result of freight increases. That said, core advertising was lower due to displacement by significantly higher demand for political advertising, particularly in the latter part of the campaign season.
Broadcast Digital revenues were up 17%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction, not only in the original Gannett stations but also in the newly acquired stations, which are now fully trained on G/O Digital products and seeing good results. Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014 to be up in the low- to mid-single digits, despite challenging year-over-year comparisons. 
First quarter 2014 Broadcast revenue benefited fully $41 million related to the Winter Olympic Games and approximately $10 million from politically-related ad demand. The challenge of overcoming these even-year revenue contributions will be partially met in the first quarter of 2015 by Super Bowl advertising in the company's NBC stations.
During the quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 3% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven by expenses associated with revenue growth initiatives at our new and existing television stations, as well as reverse compensation and investments in sales and marketing tools.
Publishing Segment advertising revenues of $544 million were impacted by secular pressure again this quarter, down approximately 8% on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of the sale of Apartments.com, with the year-over-year print advertising revenue decline partly offset by Digital growth of 6%. Within this segment, domestic Publishing advertising revenues decreased by 9% year-over-year, although the auto, real estate and employment categories have improved throughout the year. We saw the first year-over-year increase in all of these categories in December, reflecting slight growth in the U.S. economy and the job markets.
In the U.K. Newsquest advertising declined by 3% year-over-year in local currency. Pro forma, domestic online advertising revenue in the Publishing Segment increased 5% year-over-year, with retail advertising up 4%, driven by G/O Digital, with a growing base of customers seeking to diversify their marketing efforts, while increasing the efficiency of their online advertising solutions. National Digital revenues also improved 5%. Newsquest online advertising was up a robust 19% driven by retail and employment category advertising.
Publishing Segment circulation revenue continued to be strengthened by the all-access content subscription model, local USA TODAY content contribution and strategic price increases in our local U.S. publishing sites, which reported their second consecutive quarterly increase this year. This is offset by the cycling of cover price increases at Newsquest, as well as lower USA TODAY group print circulation, resulting at a total circulation revenue decline of 2% for the fourth quarter.
Publishing Segment operating expenses were below last year, down 5%, due to cost reductions and efficiency gains generated by Gannett Publishing Services and sourcing initiatives, as well as lower volume.
Publishing Segment operating income was $125 million in the quarter. Within the Publishing Segment, changes in the Cars.com affiliate agreements and the absence of Cars.com revenue had an unfavorable impact of approximately $9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, Digital segment revenue increased by 10% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, a record high driven by the addition of Cars.com, up 25%, and continued growth at CareerBuilder, which was also up 4% year-over-year. The strong Cars.com results reflect a new affiliate agreement economics, as well as organic growth in Cars.com direct markets. 
These reflect [ph] markets, which account for about 80% of total revenues generated by the Cars.com direct sales force, increased by 20% during the quarter. Also, strongly contributing to the Digital Segment this quarter, CareerBuilder growth continues to be driven by expanding sales of human capital software-as-a-solution products.
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 1% on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead acquisition costs and revenue share page affiliate markets at Cars.com, as well as cost efficiencies at CareerBuilder, which were lower by 2% year-over-year.
During the fourth quarter, company-wide Digital revenues totaled almost $540 million, reflecting an increase of 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Digital revenues contributed fully 32% of total company revenues during the quarter, another historical high for Gannett.
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $511 million increased by 27% on a pro forma basis, with year-over-year gains driven by both Broadcast and Digital Segments, which generated nearly 75% of total company-wide EBITDA. Free cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, 32% higher than last year due to our strong operating results.
During the quarter, we invested nearly $60 million in capital projects, primarily related to several local Publishing real estate initiatives and ongoing digital product development, as well as product integration and enhancements at CareerBuilder and Cars.com. As projected, we invested over $160 million of capital during 2014, with the majority of our investments dedicated to development of digital products and platforms.
With the completion of $675 million senior debt financing for Cars.com, our long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, with $118 million of cash on the balance sheet. The ending debt balance is substantially lower than expected due to cash tax savings I previously detailed, as well as strong cash from operations.
During the fourth quarter, interest expense was $74 million, largely driven by the debt associated with the acquisition of Belo and Cars.com.
During 2014, we were able to return almost $260 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases despite the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Since the time we announced the current buyback program in July of 2013, we have completed over 50% of our $300 million commitment, with 5.6 million shares repurchased at an average price of $27.03 per share.
As you've heard, we are looking forward to 2015 as a year of great opportunity, across a variety of venues within our portfolio of businesses. We anticipate a very strong year of Cars.com results, which we project to be accretive to free cash flow by approximately $0.43 a share and neutral to EPS for the year.
Naturally, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the cyclical absence of record political advertising, as well as significant Olympics revenue compared to 2014, which when combined, total $200 million. 
In addition, in 2015, we project higher expenses related to reverse compensation under the terms of our contractual commitments. Retransmission revenue is expected to be in the range of $440 million to $445 million. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, about $25 million lower than in 2014, as a result of fewer remaining real estate projects.  
Depreciation is projected to increase to approximately $210 million to $215 million in 2015, including the impact of the Cars.com acquisition. Amortization is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, also impacted by the Cars.com acquisition.
As discussed in December at the UBS Conference, we anticipate the new pension mortality tables will negatively impact pension expense this year. We'll continue to update you as this gets refined. In keeping with the prior year, the 2015 tax rate is projected to be approximately 32%.
Overall, we're very pleased with our continued progress reflected in our 2014 financial results. As we execute on our separation into 2 strong publicly traded companies midyear, we continue to see significant opportunities on the horizon and look forward to sharing those with you.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks, prior to the Q&A."

The success we've achieved over the last few years has been built upon a strong foundation of our purpose, disciplined financial stewardship, shareholder focus and board and management accountability. As we iron out the specifics of the 2 independent companies following the separation, we are committed to instilling the same kind of strong foundation at both industry-leading companies, ensuring that they are each best positioned in every way for future growth and success.
And while we're on the topic of the separation and before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the letter we received last month from Carl Icahn, stating his intention to nominate 2 candidates for election to our board and to submit nonbinding corporate governance proposals at Gannett and at the post-spin Publishing company. Mr. Icahn's attempt to dictate corporate governance at Gannett, let alone at a new company that has not yet been established and whose governance profile has yet to be determined, frankly, is overreaching. 
We have an experienced board that has been a driving force behind the successful execution of our strategy. Our corporate governance is shareholder-friendly today at Gannett, and there is no reason to think it won't be at the new Publishing company. The board, of course, will evaluate Mr. Icahn's governance proposals and his director nominees through the lens of what is best for all of our shareholders. And that's all I'll say about this today.
The spin-off is on track, and we expect to file our Form 10 sometime in March. With that, why don't we turn it over to Kayla, for questions. Thank you."

And I think what we saw in the fourth quarter, particularly at USA TODAY, where they're a great platform, for instance, for new car launches or product changes, some of those were deferred into the first quarter. And I think that, that led to a bit of an exacerbation of national numbers that we saw at USA TODAY. I think what we're looking at, as I look into the first quarter and we've gotten an early, early blush on what we think things are looking at, we should see improvement on the national advertising side because I think we'll start to see some of that auto advertising that was delayed in the fourth quarter actually starting to pick up. We had a lovely wrap on USA TODAY yesterday from Jeep Chrysler. So pleased to see that, obviously. I'd say, overall, on the Publishing side, again, early. But what we're looking at looks like it will be total revenue for Publishing, probably better by a percentage point or so in the first quarter. And it looks like total advertising revenues will be better by potentially a couple of percentage points in the first quarter. So I think we just had some interesting things going on in the fourth quarter that, at least early in the first quarter, we are seeing expectations of improvement over."

But one of the benefits of -- after the spin, we will have 2 companies that will have fantastic balance sheets. Publishing will have virtually no debt. Broadcasting even levered the way we anticipate, with all the debt going there. As you saw, our debt level was lower year end by a couple of hundred million than we thought. So we generated an enormous amount of free cash flow. We'll be able to pay down debt, et cetera. So we still have a lot of opportunity there to do great opportunistic acquisitions. We have an appetite to do them, to expand where we can on a very disciplined basis. And I think the Belo transaction, the Cars transaction, are great testaments to the fact that when we see an opportunity where we believe that we can bring a lot of value and realize that value very directly, then we are prepared to act in a meaningful way. So I think that we are very open to opportunities -- further tuck-in opportunities, certainly at least on the broadcast side, also on the Digital side. As Cars.com continues to evolve its product suite and continues to meet the needs of its clients, to the extent that there are opportunities to look at some fill-ins or some expanding of some of the things that we're doing there, then that's obviously something that we will pay a lot of good attention to. I know Bob is -- I think we're also blessed with not only having fantastic balance sheet. But we also have some of the best operators, if not the best operators in both of those companies. And so Bob's ability to bring the incredible innovation that his team and he have brought around revenue, as well as the strong cost discipline that we have there, I think leads us to believe that there may be opportunities obviously to consolidate some of the properties there. But again, always being very careful and making sure that what we're going to do is create shareholder value with any opportunity that we look at. But I think you're absolutely right, there are going to be lots of opportunities for both companies, and we will be very careful stewards of our capital and make sure that in both companies there is a direct return of some capital, but there's also other opportunities to invest in growth opportunities."

Today, I'm going to provide a high-level summary of Gannett's impressive performance in the first quarter and after that, Bob Dickey, who will be the CEO and President of our publishing business, once the split is completed, will give an overview of the publishing business, including operational highlights and financial performance during the quarter. Then Victoria will review the financial results of the company and our broadcasting and digital segments, provide some detail on special items and review our balance sheet. Dave Lougee, President of Gannett broadcasting and Jack Williams, President of Gannett Digital Ventures are also here to participate in the Q&A session. The. 
First quarter kicked off what promises to be a very strong and exciting year for us. Our exceptional results this quarter were led by significant revenue growth in our Digital Segment and solid growth in our Broadcasting Segment. Both segments achieved a record level of first quarter revenues. 
Our strategic acquisition of Cars.com continues to pay dividends and we're looking forward to the future growth of that business and the continued positive impact it will have on our Digital Segment. 
Broadcasting Segment revenues were also up, despite challenging comps given the absence of $51 million of Olympic and political ad demand that contributed to results in the first quarter last year. 
Once again, we maintained our usual discipline with regard to expenses in the quarter. Expense growth was in line with our revenue growth. This was mainly due to the acquisition of Cars.com. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, expenses were down 3%, reflecting lower Publishing Segment expenses and flattish Digital Segment expenses. 
It's important that as we grow, we continue to leverage our scale and operate as efficiently as possible. We have been successful thus far and will remain laser-focused on this going forward. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up significantly to $325 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as you read this morning, were $0.49, compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of last year, again, against tough comps. 
Overcoming those tough comps, broadcasting revenue growth was driven primarily by a very strong performance by our expanded portfolio of TV stations. I should note, that the integration of our newer stations continues to unfold quite smoothly and well ahead of our expectations. We're very excited about the potential for our portfolio of television assets. Our broadcasting footprint puts us in key high-growth geographic areas and as you know, we benefited from our expansive reach during 2014's political season. And so we are very well positioned for what is shaping up to be a very robust 2016 political season. 
The Digital Segment continues to perform better than even our expectations and achieved a record level for first quarter revenue. Cars.com had just a terrific quarter with profitability of the substantially, thanks to a 28% increase in total revenues and a slight decrease in total expenses. 
Revenue was bolstered by more favorable wholesale rates built into the new affiliate agreements signed in conjunction with Gannett's acquisition of Cars.com as well as increases in both the number of dealership customers and revenue per dealer. 
Growth in the number of dealerships that purchase Cars.com products is, especially important as we continue to rollout new, innovative solutions for our dealers. During the quarter, Cars.com launched 2 digital advertising products for dealer customers. RepairPal certified is the first program designed specifically to help differentiate dealership service departments. It was launched in partnership with RepairPal, the leading resource for consumer car care. In addition, event positions helps leadership event in front of a local in-market shopping audience during a limited time frame. 
As important as dealer relationships are, it's also critical to help the very best editorial content and to position that content in the optimal way to reach the maximum number of potential consumers. Accordingly, Cars.com re-platformed its content from the kicking tires blog to the main Cars.com site. The move allows for a better consumer experience across devices through responsive design, and this is a perfect example of how we are leveraging our expertise as content providers to expand the breadth of Cars.com and attract new users. Expanding Cars.com's reach to new dealers and customers and enhancing the experience for both new and prospective users will help drive revenue growth throughout 2015 and well beyond. 
The other primary component of our Digital Segment, as you know, is CareerBuilder, the global leader in human capital solutions, which continues to be an integral part of our digital portfolio. It provides unmatched reach from employers by offering the largest online career destination in the U.S. for jobseekers and maintains the largest online recruitment sales presence in North America. 
CareerBuilder has been making significant investments over the past few years to further our transformation into a global leader in the HR Software-as-a-Service arena and as I mentioned last quarter, this is a growing source of CareerBuilder's increasing revenues. 
CareerBuilder has built the only global prehire Software-as-a-Service platform that addresses virtually all of employers' significant prehire meets needs from attraction to candidate acquisitions, to internal portfolio, to candidate remarketing. 
CareerBuilder is uniquely positioned to provide this one-of-a-kind service. Having been a leader in recruitment advertising for years, the focus at  CareerBuilder were building a valuable insights into the needs of employers and the reasons why the efforts to fulfill those needs sometimes fail. By bringing together advertising, software and data into one integrated prehire platform, CareerBuilder is bringing a complete solution to the markets that no one else in the industry can offer. 
Moving onto G/O Digital. This business again saw strong Q1 revenue traction year-over-year from small- to medium-sized business customers. Revenue from local advertisers rose over 32% versus last year, led by increases across key product solutions, including search, email and social marketing products. G/O Digital, which has won awards for its work on behalf of customers have seen its client roster grow significantly over the past year. 
In light of the strong success of G/O Digital, the next logical step in its evolution is to create 2 distinct business efforts: G/O Digital local and G/O Digital national with separate leadership dedicate to each, along with a common shared services group to support both units. 
As innovation, excellent products and top-notch services have allowed G/O Digital to expand, each of these distinct revenue sources have evolved and become capable of thriving as a stand-alone business. 
Reorganizing G/O Digital's business drives better alignment with these 2 distinct markets and customer sets that we serve. Both business units of tremendous potential as high-growth, large revenue businesses. 
I mentioned earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a defining year in Gannett's history. The event we're all looking forward to is, of course, our planned separation into 2 publicly traded companies, which is on track to be completed in mid-2015. When our Publishing Segment becomes a stand-alone company later this year, one of the many strengths on which it will thrive as an exceptional leadership team led by Bob Dickey, as CEO and President. He and his team have launched just some terrific initiatives that are driving both audience engagement and revenue generation for publishing. Bob's going to review publishing's first quarter performance and he'll also talk a little about the soon to be independent company. Bob?"

First, let me say how honored and excited I am to have been chosen to lead the new Gannett. I've been at this company for more than 2 decades. To tell you firsthand, this is a very exciting time not only for Gannett, but for publishing, specifically.
We've made significant strides in the past few years to provide our audiences with fresh content, to keep them engaged and then serve as an integral member of their local community, all while continuing our long-held tradition of being a very strong operator. 
The response to new key concepts we've launched recently has been overwhelmingly positive and it encourages us to dig deeper and provide our audiences with increasingly new ways to consume the news and information they crave. We will continue to focus on innovation, finding creative approaches to producing and delivering superior content, all along engaging with subscribers and our communities and servicing, of course, our advertising partners. Not only will the new Gannett continue to push the envelope in terms of products and services, but we will begin our life as an independent company with strong financial footing, positioning us to be a successful consolidator of local market publishing and related digital operations in the future and invest in products and services that will drive growth.
We'll be financially disciplined, maintaining a strong flexible balance sheet through conscientious cost management, conservative financial policies and strong and efficient operations, the new publishing company will remain committed to preserving financial flexibility and maximizing cash flow to allow investments that enhance our company.
Focusing now on the first quarter. Our combination of award-winning journalism and innovative distribution methods kept Gannett at the top of the industry. The All Access Content Subscription Model continues to help drive circulation revenue as home delivery revenue was up in the quarter. It is also contributing to circulation volume and U.S.A. Today's position as the #1 in total daily circulation. U.S.A. Today local content editions have become must-reads in all the markets to which we've rolled them out so far. 
As we've mentioned, we've been partnering with other publishers to expand the reach of U.S.A. Today's high-quality content beyond Gannett's already expansive footprints. Since our last call, U.S.A. Today content has started running in a number of widely read news outlets, including the Chicago Sun-Times, the Knoxville News Sentinel, the Colorado Springs Gazette and the American News at Aberdeen, South Dakota, the birth place of USA TODAY very own Founder, Al Newheart.
Total additional daily circulation is approximately 275,000 copies, while Sunday circulation is just over 891,000 edition. And negotiations continue with several other non-Gannett publishers. It's clear that the demand for our outstanding U.S.A. Today local content edition is significant.
We are leveraging this popularity by incorporating them into third-party news outlets, expanding our reach and gaining access to new communities that value U.S.A. Today's award-winning journalism. 
The industry is still up against the tough display advertising environment but our talented team has done a great job of weathering the current environment to create value and provide our audiences with the critical news and information they demand from us on a daily basis on all platforms.
Turning to the quarterly results for Publishing Segment. Overall, Publishing Segment revenues were down approximately 5% on a pro forma constant currency basis. The sequential improvement from the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Several factors unfavorably impacted year-over-year comparison, primarily continued softness in display advertising, the change in the Cars.com affiliate agreement economics, the absence of revenue associated with USA Weekend, Gannett Healthcare Group, Apartments.com and the commercial printing operation, as well as a year-over-year decline in the U.K. exchange rate.
While display advertising was down, digital revenue continued its substantial growth. The digital properties associated with the publishing business continue to perform very well. Pro forma domestic online advertising revenue in the Publishing Segment increased 7% year-over-year with retail advertising up 10% year-over-year, driven by G/O Digital with a growing base of customers seeking to diversify their marketing efforts, while increasing the efficiency of their online advertising solutions. National digital revenues also improved 11%. 
Newsquest online advertising was up an impressive 15%, mainly reflecting the strength of local and national display advertising. Publishing Segment's advertising revenues were impacted by secular pressure, again, this quarter and the absence of USA Weekend as well as the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group and Apartments.com. 
On a pro forma constant currency basis, Publishing Segment advertising was down approximately 7% with the year-over-year print advertising declined, partially offset by digital growth of 7%. 
Within the segment, domestic publishing advertising revenues decreased by 8% year-over-year, which was negatively impacted by lower advertising demand and a harsh winter weather impacts on retail sector advertising. In the U.K., Newsquest advertising declined by 4% year-over-year in local currency, but retail and national categories showed sequential improvement.
Publishing Segment circulation revenue was down 3% year-over-year due primarily to declines at USA TODAY and Newsquest. The ongoing strength of the All Access Content Subscription Model as well as our strategic pricing resulted in our local U.S. publishing side home deliveries accretion revenues to be higher compared to last year and helped USA TODAY maintained its #1 position in daily circulation, as Gracia mentioned. 
We continue to focus on cost efficiencies during the quarter and as a result, pro forma non-GAAP expenses were 4% lower. While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, we are optimistic about the initiatives we have in place and the reception has been even better-than-anticipated. We look forward to further stabilizing our publishing business as we continue to make positive progress executing our current strategy. 
Importantly, the publishing company also will have the financial flexibility to capitalize on new opportunities, backed by the brand trust, strong operations and journalistic talent that come with the Gannett name. Our team is incredibly excited about what lies ahead for than the Gannett. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Victoria to provide a detailed review of the financial results for broadcasting and Digital Segment."
20571,290478729,790992,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia already mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, testament to the outstanding progress and the strategic information journey of our company. Before I review our financials",1147,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia already mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, testament to the outstanding progress and the strategic information journey of our company. 
Before I review our financials as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few reviewing some special items, which impacted the quarter to help provide additional context for our recurring performance trend. 
Our ongoing efforts to transform the business continue to generate greater operating efficiencies and effectiveness across the portfolio. These initiatives drove workforce and other restructurings across several of our businesses for a total of $30 million with an EPS impact of about $0.03 per share. Total nonoperating special items totaled $26 million with an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share, mainly related to a gain on the sale of Gannett's Healthcare group earlier this year. 
Now let's briefly review the ongoing operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. 
As Gracia mentioned, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the absence of significant Olympics and political advertising broadcasting as well as $27 million of revenue previously associated with USA Weekend and the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group, which comprised about $20 million of the total with the remainder comprised of Apartments.com and the sale of a commercial printing business. 
Additionally, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate declined by 8% year-over-year, impacting revenues by about $10 million and EPS by $0.01. Despite this, total company revenues of $1.5 billion, were up 5% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.2 billion, excluding special items, were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com, partially offset by our continuous focus on efficiencies as well as lower volume in the Publishing Segment. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of broadcasting and Digital Segment results. As I mentioned, last year, we had $51 million of Olympic and political advertising and broadcasting during the first quarter, a challenging hurdle to overcome. Despite this tough comparison, we're very pleased with the broadcasting revenues, which were up 4% year-over-year, benefited by strong retransmission fees and record Super Bowl advertising revenues. Retransmission fees continue to grow substantially, up 26% as a result of new and negotiated agreements at the end of last year as well as annual increases within the existing agreements.
Broadcast digital revenues were up 11%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across the television stations as the newly acquired station are now fully trained on G/O Digital products and seeing good sales results. 
Based on current trends, broadcast revenue in the second quarter is projected to be up in the mid-single digits compared to last year, again, despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons of $17 million in political advertising last year. 
During the quarter, broadcast segment operating expenses were up 6% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to reverse compensation and investments in our digital sales initiatives
During the quarter, as mentioned, Digital Segment revenue increased about 85% year-over-year, driven by both the acquisition as well as the strong operating results of Cars.com, which was up 28%. 
On a pro forma basis, Digital Segment revenues were 10% higher driven by the growth of Cars.com and continued growth at CareerBuilder, up 4% year-over-year. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were flat compared to last year on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead generation cost and better affiliate economics at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at CareerBuilder, offset by higher sales cost supporting associated revenue growth.
During the first quarter, company-wide digital revenues totaled $513 million, reflecting an increase of 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Digital revenues contributed fully 35% of total company revenues during the quarter, another historic high for Gannett. 
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $325 million increased 14% over last year. Broadcasting and Digital Segments accounted for nearly 85% of total company-wide EBITDA. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $130 million and each of our segments continue to be solidly profitable. 
During the quarter, we invested over $19 million in capital projects, primarily related to several local publishing real estate initiatives, which will generate about $4 million in annual operating cost savings as well as ongoing digital price developments, product integration and enhancements at both CareerBuilder and Cars.com. 
As we mentioned in our previous call, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million for the year with the majority of our capital investment dedicated to development of digital products and platform.
As we announced in February, we resumed our share buyback program well ahead of the time line we've previously anticipated given the strength of our ongoing financial performance. As a result, we repurchased about 1.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $35.07 per share. 
As Gracia mentioned, the separation of our publishing business is quickly approaching. Last month, we filed our Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, which is an important step in the separation process. You can find that filing in the Investor Relations page at Gannett's website or on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website under Gannettspincoinc. The Form 10 includes information regarding the transaction and the stand-alone publishing company.
As outlined in the Form 10, the publishing company expect to pay a regular cash dividend of $0.32 per share annually and plans to commence $150 million share repurchase program expected to be used over 3-year period. The broadcasting and digital company will also continue Gannett's focus on delivering strong returns to shareholders such to pay regular cash dividend of $0.56 annually, which, combined with the publishing company's anticipated dividend, represents a 10% increase over the current Gannett dividend. The broadcasting and digital company also plans to replace its existing share repurchases program with a new $750 million authorization program expected to be used over the 3-year period after the separation. 
Those expected new authorization, combined with the publishing company's authorization, represents more than a doubling of the current Gannett share repurchase program. In addition, under the current plan, both companies will have leverage levels well below peer companies and will maintain the flexibility to address repurchases based on business conditions, new opportunities and other factors. 
During the quarter, we carry a slightly higher interest expense related to our higher average debt balance due to the Cars.com acquisition, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.4 billion and after utilizing cash for debt and interest payments as well as share repurchases, we closed the quarter with $136 million of cash on the balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to Q&A."

There's a some of innovation happening in our Digital Segment as both our building and Cars.com explore new avenues for growth. Broadcasters performing well and the integration of our new stations is proceeding even better than we hope and we are on track to achieve at least, if not more, than the goal for our synergies. 
In publishing, our USA TODAY local content is really catching on, so much so that other publishers as you heard Bob say, want our content in their publications, giving us access to previously untapped audiences and revenue sources. 
As 3 years of hard work, relentless focus and successful execution of our strategic transformation plan culminate in our separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies, the momentum we are currently generating will serve us well as we embark on the next chapter of the Gannett story. 
As you just heard, all 3 of our business segments are on an upward trajectory and we are very, very excited about their future prospects. Gannett is exceptionally well positioned and the progress and invention will only accelerate when we become 2 more nimble and more highly focused companies.

And then with respect to the other businesses, we provided guidance for broadcasting this morning, as we said, we expect total revenues for the segment to be up in the mid-single digits and as a Victoria pointed out, we'll be absent about $17 million of political. Publishing, on the publishing side, on a pro forma constant currency basis, because currency is really starting to have an impact as I'm sure we're going to hear on lots of earnings calls. If you look at the ad revenues, it looks like, Bob, I'd say, they're about a percentage point or so better than what we saw in the first quarter, which was a percentage point or so better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. Currency just, to put it in perspective, the currency rate was down about 8% in the first quarter. Looking at where the pound is right at the moment, it looks like currency would be down around 11% or so in the second quarter, so obviously, that will have -- it us about $0.01 in EPS in the first quarters, so it'll probably cost as a bit more than that's in the second quarter, obviously. Cars.com, I think we would expect to see, Jack, sort of the same range of revenue growth as we saw in the first quarter, 25-ish percent and CareerBuilder looks like it's traveling about the same as what we saw. Now they've got it a little impact from currency as well because they're in a number of countries and that costs us some of millions of dollars in the first quarter. And we would expect we'll have a similar, if not slightly more meaningful impact in the second quarter."

On the pension side, as we indicated in our Form 10, we tend to have the liabilities follow where the employees will end up post-spin. So given that the vast majority of our employees are in the pension plan are retired or are current actives, imitated from the publishing side, more of that pension plan clearly is going to go to publishing. And we've outlined those numbers in the Form 10. Now obviously on the broadcasting and digital side, our digital business has never had a pension plan so there's no pension liabilities there. On The broadcast side, obviously with the acquisition of its we picked up their plan as well as a few hundred million dollars of liability on the remainder of the broadcasting and corporate employees that will be associated with the broadcasting and digital company going forward. So have no real plans to change that. Our pension fund is well over 80% funded. When you look at the fact that we have a frozen plan and have had a frozen plan since 2008, with a return that is lower than the day historical return, generated on the plan, via a 3, 5, 10, 20 or since inception in 1979, we have ample assets in the plan to pay out all of those liabilities. So feel very good about where they will be. I think, post-spin, it looks like, at this point, that plan that will go to publishing will be even more funded than the 3 -- 2% or so that it's funded currently. And similarly on the Broadcast and Digital Segment. So we feel very good about where we are on both things."

Today, I'm going to provide a high-level summary of Gannett's impressive performance in the first quarter and after that, Bob Dickey, who will be the CEO and President of our publishing business, once the split is completed, will give an overview of the publishing business, including operational highlights and financial performance during the quarter. Then Victoria will review the financial results of the company and our Broadcasting and Digital Segments, provide some detail on special items and review our balance sheet. Dave Lougee, President of Gannett Broadcasting, and Jack Williams, President of Gannett Digital Ventures, are also here to participate in the Q&A session.
The first quarter kicked off what promises to be a very strong and exciting year for us. Our exceptional results this quarter were led by significant revenue growth in our Digital Segment and solid growth in our Broadcasting Segment. Both segments achieved a record level of first quarter revenues. 
Our strategic acquisition of Cars.com continues to pay dividends, and we're looking forward to the future growth of that business and the continued positive impact it will have on our Digital Segment. 
Broadcasting Segment revenues were also up, despite challenging comps, given the absence of $51 million of Olympic and political ad demand that contributed to results in the first quarter last year. 
Once again, we maintained our usual discipline with regard to expenses in the quarter. Expense growth was in line with our revenue growth. This was mainly due to the acquisition of Cars.com. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, expenses were down 3%, reflecting lower Publishing Segment expenses and flattish Digital Segment expenses. 
It's important that as we grow, we continue to leverage our scale and operate as efficiently as possible. We have been successful thus far and will remain laser-focused on this going forward. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up significantly to $325 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, as you read this morning, were $0.49, compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of last year, again, against tough comps. 
Overcoming those tough comps, broadcasting revenue growth was driven primarily by a very strong performance by our expanded portfolio of TV stations. I should note, that the integration of our newer stations continues to unfold quite smoothly and well ahead of our expectations. We're very excited about the potential for our portfolio of television assets. Our broadcasting footprint puts us in key high-growth geographic areas and as you know, we benefited from our expansive reach during 2014's political season. And so we are very well positioned for what is shaping up to be a very robust 2016 political season. 
The Digital Segment continues to perform better than even our expectations and achieved a record level for first quarter revenue. Cars.com had just a terrific quarter with profitability up substantially, thanks to a 28% increase in total revenues and a slight decrease in total expenses. 
Revenue was bolstered by more favorable wholesale rates built into the new affiliate agreements signed in conjunction with Gannett's acquisition of Cars.com as well as increases in both the number of dealership customers and revenue per dealer. 
Growth in the number of dealerships that purchase Cars.com products is especially important as we continue to roll out new, innovative solutions for our dealers. During the quarter, Cars.com launched 2 digital advertising products for dealer customers. RepairPal certified is the first program designed specifically to help differentiate dealership service departments. It was launched in partnership with RepairPal, the leading resource for consumer car care. In addition, event positions helps put dealership events in front of a local in-market shopping audience during a limited time frame. 
As important as dealer relationships are, it's also critical to have the very best editorial content and to position that content in the optimal way to reach the maximum number of potential consumers. Accordingly, Cars.com re-platformed its content from the Kicking Tires blog to the main Cars.com site. The move allows for a better consumer experience across devices through responsive design, and this is a perfect example of how we are leveraging our expertise as content providers to expand the breadth of Cars.com and attract new users. Expanding Cars.com's reach to new dealers and customers and enhancing the experience for both new and prospective users will help drive revenue growth throughout 2015 and well beyond. 
The other primary component of our Digital Segment, as you know, is CareerBuilder, the global leader in human capital solutions, which continues to be an integral part of our digital portfolio. It provides unmatched reach from employers by offering the largest online career destination in the U.S. for jobseekers and maintains the largest online recruitment sales presence in North America. 
CareerBuilder has been making significant investments over the past few years to further our transformation into a global leader in the HR Software-as-a-Service arena and as I mentioned last quarter, this is a growing source of CareerBuilder's increasing revenues. 
CareerBuilder has built the only global prehire Software-as-a-Service platform that addresses virtually all of an employer's significant prehire needs from attraction to candidate acquisition, to internal workflow, to candidate remarketing. 
CareerBuilder is uniquely positioned to provide this one-of-a-kind service. Having been a leader in recruitment advertising for years, the folks at CareerBuilder have invaluable insights into the needs of employers and the reasons why the efforts to fulfill those needs sometimes fail. By bringing together advertising, software and data into one integrated prehire platform, CareerBuilder is bringing a complete solution to the market that no one else in the industry can offer. 
Moving onto G/O Digital. This business again saw strong Q1 revenue traction year-over-year from small- to medium-sized business customers. Revenue from local advertisers rose over 32% versus last year, led by increases across key product solutions, including search, email and social marketing products. G/O Digital, which has won awards for its work on behalf of customers, has seen its client roster grow significantly over the past year. 
In light of the strong success of G/O Digital, the next logical step in its evolution is to create 2 distinct business efforts: G/O Digital local and G/O Digital national with separate leadership dedicate to each, along with a common shared services group to support both units. As innovation, excellent products and top-notch services have allowed G/O Digital to expand, each of these distinct revenue sources has evolved and become capable of thriving as a stand-alone business. 
Reorganizing G/O Digital's businesses drives better alignment with these 2 distinct markets and customer sets that we serve. Both business units have tremendous potential as high-growth, large revenue businesses. 
I mentioned earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a defining year in Gannett's history. The event we're all looking forward to is, of course, our planned separation into 2 publicly traded companies, which is on track to be completed in mid-2015. When our Publishing Segment becomes a stand-alone company later this year, one of the many strengths on which it will thrive as an exceptional leadership team led by Bob Dickey, as CEO and President. He and his team have launched just some terrific initiatives that are driving both audience engagement and revenue generation for publishing. Bob's going to review publishing's first quarter performance, and he'll also talk a little about the ""soon to be independent"" company. Bob?"

First, let me say how honored and excited I am to have been chosen to lead the new Gannett. I've been at this company for more than 2 decades. To tell you firsthand, this is a very exciting time not only for Gannett, but for publishing, specifically.
We've made significant strides in the past few years to provide our audiences with fresh content, to keep them engaged and then serve as an integral member of their local communities, all while continuing our long-held tradition of being a very strong operator. 
The response to new key concepts we've launched recently has been overwhelmingly positive and it encourages us to dig deeper and provide our audiences with increasingly new ways to consume the news and information they crave. We will continue to focus on innovation, finding creative approaches to producing and delivering superior content, all along engaging with subscribers and our communities and servicing, of course, our advertising partners. Not only will the new Gannett continue to push the envelope in terms of products and services, but we will begin our life as an independent company with strong financial footing, positioning us to be a successful consolidator of local market publishing and related digital operations in the future and invest in products and services that will drive growth.
We'll be financially disciplined, maintaining a strong flexible balance sheet through conscientious cost management, conservative financial policies and strong and efficient operations. The new publishing company will remain committed to preserving financial flexibility and maximizing cash flow to allow investments that enhance our company.
Focusing now on the first quarter. Our combination of award-winning journalism and innovative distribution methods kept Gannett atop the industry. The All Access Content Subscription Model continues to help drive circulation revenue as home delivery revenue was up in the quarter. It is also contributing to circulation volume and USA TODAY's position as the #1 in total daily circulation. USA TODAY local content editions have become must-reads in all the markets to which we've rolled them out so far. 
As we've mentioned, we've been partnering with other publishers to expand the reach of USA TODAY's high-quality content beyond Gannett's already expansive footprint. Since our last call, USA TODAY content has started running in a number of widely read news outlets, including the Chicago Sun-Times, the Knoxville News Sentinel, the Colorado Springs Gazette and The American News out of Aberdeen, South Dakota, the birth place of USA TODAY's very own Founder, Al Neuharth.
Total additional daily circulation is approximately 275,000 copies, while Sunday circulation is just over 891,000 additional. And negotiations continue with several other non-Gannett publishers. It's clear that the demand for our outstanding USA TODAY local-content edition is significant. We are leveraging this popularity by incorporating them into third-party news outlets, expanding our reach and gaining access to new communities that value USA TODAY's award-winning journalism. 
The industry is still up against the tough display advertising environment, but our talented team has done a great job of weathering the current environment to create value and provide our audiences with the critical news and information they demand from us on a daily basis on all platforms.
Turning to the quarterly results for the Publishing Segment. Overall, Publishing Segment revenues were down approximately 5% on a pro forma constant currency basis. The sequential improvement from the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter of 2014. Several factors unfavorably impacted year-over-year comparison, primarily continued softness in display advertising, the change in the Cars.com affiliate agreement economics, the absence of revenue associated with USA WEEKEND, Gannett Healthcare Group, Apartments.com and the commercial printing operation, as well as a year-over-year decline in the U.K. exchange rate.
While display advertising was down, digital revenue continued its substantial growth. The digital properties associated with the publishing business continue to perform very well. Pro forma domestic online advertising revenue in the Publishing Segment increased 7% year-over-year with retail advertising up 10% year-over-year, driven by G/O Digital with a growing base of customers seeking to diversify their marketing efforts, while increasing the efficiency of their online advertising solutions. National digital revenues also improved 11%. 
Newsquest online advertising was up an impressive 15%, mainly reflecting the strength of local and national display advertising. Publishing Segment's advertising revenues were impacted by secular pressure, again, this quarter and the absence of USA WEEKEND as well as the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group and Apartments.com. 
On a pro forma constant currency basis, Publishing Segment advertising was down approximately 7% with the year-over-year print advertising decline, partially offset by digital growth of 7%. 
Within the segment, domestic publishing advertising revenues decreased by 8% year-over-year, which was negatively impacted by lower advertising demand and a harsh winter weather impacts on retail sector advertising. In the U.K., Newsquest advertising declined by 4% year-over-year in local currency, but retail and national categories showed sequential improvements.
Publishing Segment circulation revenue was down 3% year-over-year due primarily to declines at USA TODAY and Newsquest. The ongoing strength of the All Access Content Subscription Model as well as our strategic pricing resulted in our local U.S. publishing side home delivery circulation revenues to be higher compared to last year and helped USA TODAY maintained its #1 position in daily circulation, as Gracia mentioned. 
We continue to focus on cost efficiencies during the quarter and as a result, pro forma non-GAAP expenses were 4% lower. While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, we are optimistic about the initiatives we have in place and the reception has been even better than anticipated. We look forward to further stabilizing our publishing business as we continue to make positive progress executing our current strategy. 
Importantly, the publishing company also will have the financial flexibility to capitalize on new opportunities, backed by the brand trust, strong operations and journalistic talent that come with the Gannett name. Our team is incredibly excited about what lies ahead for the new Gannett. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Victoria to provide a detailed review of the financial results for Broadcasting and Digital Segments."
20571,290478729,791211,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia already mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, testament to the outstanding progress and the strategic transformation journey of our company. Before I review our financi",1150,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia already mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, testament to the outstanding progress and the strategic transformation journey of our company. 
Before I review our financials as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which impacted the quarter to help provide additional context for our recurring performance trend. 
Our ongoing efforts to transform the business continue to generate greater operating efficiencies and effectiveness across the portfolio. These initiatives drove workforce and other restructurings across several of our businesses for a total of $13 million with an EPS impact of about $0.03 per share. Total nonoperating special items totaled $26 million with an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share, mainly related to a gain on the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group earlier this year. 
Now let's briefly review the ongoing operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. 
As Gracia mentioned, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the absence of significant Olympics and political advertising in broadcasting as well as $27 million of revenue previously associated with USA WEEKEND and the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group, which comprised about $20 million of the total, with the remainder comprised of Apartments.com and the sale of a commercial printing business. Additionally, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate declined by 8% year-over-year, impacting revenues by about $10 million and EPS by $0.01. Despite this, total company revenues of $1.5 billion, were up 5% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.2 billion, excluding special items, were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com, partially offset by our continued focus on efficiencies as well as lower volume in the Publishing Segment. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Broadcasting and Digital Segment results. As I mentioned, last year, we had $51 million of Olympic and political advertising in broadcasting during the first quarter, a challenging hurdle to overcome. Despite this tough comparison, we're very pleased with the broadcasting revenues, which were up 4% year-over-year, benefited by strong retransmission fees and record Super Bowl advertising revenues. Retransmission fees continue to grow substantially, up 26% as a result of new renegotiated agreements at the end of last year as well as annual increases within the existing agreements.
Broadcast digital revenues were up 11%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across our television stations as the newly acquired stations are now fully trained on G/O Digital products and seeing good sales results. 
Based on current trends, broadcast revenue in the second quarter is projected to be up in the mid-single digits compared to last year, again, despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons of $17 million in political advertising last year. 
During the quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 6% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to reverse compensation and investments in our digital sales initiatives
During the quarter, as mentioned, Digital Segment revenue increased about 85% year-over-year, driven by both the acquisition as well as the strong operating results of Cars.com, which was up 28%. On a pro forma basis, Digital Segment revenues were 10% higher, driven by the growth of Cars.com and continued growth at CareerBuilder, up 4% year-over-year. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were flat compared to last year on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead generation cost and better affiliate economics at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at CareerBuilder, offset by higher sales cost supporting associated revenue growth.
During the first quarter, company-wide digital revenues totaled $513 million, reflecting an increase of 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Digital revenues contributed fully 35% of total company revenues during the quarter, another historic high for Gannett. 
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $325 million increased 14% over last year. Broadcasting and Digital Segments accounted for nearly 85% of total company-wide EBITDA. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $130 million and each of our segments continues to be solidly profitable. 
During the quarter, we invested over $19 million in capital projects, primarily related to several local publishing real estate initiatives, which will generate about $4 million in annual operating cost savings as well as ongoing digital price developments, product integration and enhancements at both CareerBuilder and Cars.com. 
As we mentioned in our previous call, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million for the year with the majority of our capital investment dedicated to development of digital products and platform.
As we announced in February, we resumed our share buyback program well ahead of the time line we've previously anticipated, given the strength of our ongoing financial performance. As a result, we repurchased about 1.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $35.07 per share. 
As Gracia mentioned, the separation of our publishing business is quickly approaching. Last month, we filed our Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC, which is an important step in the separation process. You can find that filing in the Investor Relations page at Gannett's website or on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website under Gannett SpinCo, Inc. The Form 10 includes information regarding the transaction and the stand-alone publishing company.
As outlined in the Form 10, the publishing company expects to pay a regular cash dividend of $0.32 per share annually and plans to commence $150 million share repurchase program expected to be used over a 3-year period. The broadcasting and digital company will also continue Gannett's focus on delivering strong returns to shareholders, expect to pay a regular cash dividend of $0.56 annually, which, combined with the publishing company's anticipated dividend, represents a 10% increase over the current Gannett dividend. The broadcasting and digital company also plans to replace its existing share repurchase program with a new $750 million authorization program expected to be used over the 3-year period after the separation. 
This expected new authorization, combined with the publishing company's authorization, represents more than a doubling of the current Gannett share repurchase program. In addition, under the current plan, both companies will have leverage levels well below peer companies and will maintain the flexibility to address repurchases based on business conditions, new opportunities and other factors. 
During the quarter, we carried slightly higher interest expense related to a higher average debt balance due to Cars.com acquisition, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.4 billion. And after utilizing cash for debt and interest payments as well as share repurchases, we closed the quarter with $136 million of cash on the balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to Q&A."

It goes without saying that 2015 will be a turning point in Gannett's history. As we enter the fourth year of our transformation journey this year, we started the year on a strong footing, and we are incredibly pleased to have done just that with a terrific performance in the quarter. 
There's a tremendous amount of innovation happening in our Digital Segment as both CareerBuilder and Cars.com explore new avenues of growth. Broadcast is performing well and the integration of our new stations is proceeding even better than we hoped, and we are on track to achieve at least, if not more, than the goal for our synergies. 
In publishing, our USA TODAY local content is really catching on, so much so that other publishers, as you heard Bob say, want our content in their publications, giving us access to previously untapped audiences and revenue sources. 
As 3 years of hard work, relentless focus and successful execution of our strategic transformation plan culminate in our separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies, the momentum we are currently generating will serve us well as we embark on the next chapter of the Gannett story. 
As you just heard, all 3 of our business segments are on an upward trajectory, and we are very excited about their future prospects. Gannett is exceptionally well positioned and the progress and invention will only accelerate when we become 2 more nimble and more highly focused companies. 
As has always been the case, we have all of Gannett's dedicated and talented employees to thank for bringing us to where we are today. Their hard work and support has allowed us to produce must-see content for our audiences, our for best-in-class marketing solutions for our advertising partners and generate significant value for our shareholders. 
With that, let's open the call up for questions."

So in that $10 million to $12 million -- $10 million to $15 million range. And then with respect to the other businesses, we provided guidance for broadcasting this morning. As we said, we expect total revenues for the segment to be up in the mid-single digits. And as a Victoria pointed out, we'll be absent about $17 million of political. Publishing, on the publishing side, on a pro forma constant currency basis, because currency is really starting to have an impact, as I'm sure we're going to hear on lots of earnings calls. If you look at the ad revenues, it looks like, Bob, I'd say, they're about a percentage point or so better than what we saw in the first quarter, which was a percentage point or so better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. Currency, just to put it in perspective, the currency rate was down about 8% in the first quarter. Looking at where the pound is right at the moment, it looks like currency would be down around 11% or so in the second quarter. So obviously, that will have -- it costs us about $0.01 in EPS in the first quarter, so it'll probably cost us a bit more than that in the second quarter, obviously. Cars.com, I think we would expect to see, Jack, sort of the same range of revenue growth as we saw in the first quarter, 25-ish percent and CareerBuilder looks like it's traveling about the same as what we saw. Now they've got a little impact from currency as well because they're in a number of countries and that costs us some millions of dollars in the first quarter. And we would expect we'll have a similar, if not slightly more meaningful impact in the second quarter."

On the pension side, as we indicated in our Form 10, we tend to have the liabilities follow where the employees will end up post-spin. So given that the vast majority of our employees, who are in the pension plan, are retired or are current actives, emanated from the publishing side, more of that pension plan clearly is going to go to publishing. And we've outlined those numbers in the Form 10. Now obviously on the broadcasting and digital side, our digital businesses have never had a pension plan so there's no pension liabilities there. On the broadcast side, obviously with the acquisition of Belo, we picked up their plan as well as a few hundred million dollars of liability on the remainder of the broadcasting and corporate employees that will be associated with the broadcasting and digital company going forward. So have no real plans to change that. Our pension fund is well over 80% funded. When you look at the fact that we have a frozen plan and have had a frozen plan since 2008, with a return that is lower than the historical return we've ever generated on the plan, be it a 3, 5, 10, 20 or since inception in 1979, we have ample assets in the plan to pay out all of those liabilities. So we feel very good about where they will be. I think, post-spin, it looks like, at this point, the plan that will go to publishing will be even more funded than the 3 -- 2% or so that it's funded currently, and similarly on the broadcast and digital sides.

Frankly, when you look at what we think about where the highest congestion is, is really in that I-95 corridor from Boston down to Washington, up in L.A., San Francisco and some other areas. So I don't think that the auction is going to treat everybody the same. But I think that, certainly, out there is creating some hesitancy for folks to look at either selling their stations until they have a better grasp on how the auction is going to be run, when it's going to be run, what the rules are going to be and whether there is an opportunity or not for their stations.

And unlike a lot of the mobile advertising -- the mobile efforts you've seen where there's been very little monetization, what I think we found and, Jack, correct me if I'm wrong, is that with Cars.com, because the mobile experience is really very close to the bottom of the sales funnel, we've actually seen a fair amount of monetization of that mobile traffic. But Jack, if you want to add anything?"

Today, I'm going to provide a high-level summary of Gannett's impressive performance in the first quarter and after that, Bob Dickey, who will be the CEO and President of our publishing business, once the split is completed, will give an overview of the publishing business, including operational highlights and financial performance during the quarter. Then Victoria will review the financial results of the company and our Broadcasting and Digital Segments, provide some detail on special items and review our balance sheet. Dave Lougee, President of Gannett Broadcasting, and Jack Williams, President of Gannett Digital Ventures, are also here to participate in the Q&A session.
The first quarter kicked off what promises to be a very strong and exciting year for us. Our exceptional results this quarter were led by significant revenue growth in our Digital Segment and solid growth in our Broadcasting Segment. Both segments achieved a record level of first quarter revenues. 
Our strategic acquisition of Cars.com continues to pay dividends, and we're looking forward to the future growth of that business and the continued positive impact it will have on our Digital Segment. 
Broadcasting Segment revenues were also up, despite challenging comps, given the absence of $51 million of Olympic and political ad demand that contributed to results in the first quarter last year. 
Once again, we maintained our usual discipline with regard to expenses in the quarter. Expense growth was in line with our revenue growth. This was mainly due to the acquisition of Cars.com. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, expenses were down 3%, reflecting lower Publishing Segment expenses and flattish Digital Segment expenses. 
It's important that as we grow, we continue to leverage our scale and operate as efficiently as possible. We have been successful thus far and will remain laser-focused on this going forward. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up significantly to $325 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, as you read this morning, were $0.49, compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of last year, again, against tough comps. 
Overcoming those tough comps, broadcasting revenue growth was driven primarily by a very strong performance by our expanded portfolio of TV stations. I should note, that the integration of our newer stations continues to unfold quite smoothly and well ahead of our expectations. We're very excited about the potential for our portfolio of television assets. Our broadcasting footprint puts us in key high-growth geographic areas and as you know, we benefited from our expansive reach during 2014's political season. And so we are very well positioned for what is shaping up to be a very robust 2016 political season. 
The Digital Segment continues to perform better than even our expectations and achieved a record level for first quarter revenue. Cars.com had just a terrific quarter with profitability up substantially, thanks to a 28% increase in total revenues and a slight decrease in total expenses. 
Revenue was bolstered by more favorable wholesale rates built into the new affiliate agreements signed in conjunction with Gannett's acquisition of Cars.com as well as increases in both the number of dealership customers and revenue per dealer. 
Growth in the number of dealerships that purchase Cars.com products is especially important as we continue to roll out new, innovative solutions for our dealers. During the quarter, Cars.com launched 2 digital advertising products for dealer customers. RepairPal certified is the first program designed specifically to help differentiate dealership service departments. It was launched in partnership with RepairPal, the leading resource for consumer car care. In addition, event positions helps put dealership events in front of a local in-market shopping audience during a limited time frame. 
As important as dealer relationships are, it's also critical to have the very best editorial content and to position that content in the optimal way to reach the maximum number of potential consumers. Accordingly, Cars.com re-platformed its content from the Kicking Tires blog to the main Cars.com site. The move allows for a better consumer experience across devices through responsive design, and this is a perfect example of how we are leveraging our expertise as content providers to expand the breadth of Cars.com and attract new users. Expanding Cars.com's reach to new dealers and customers and enhancing the experience for both new and prospective users will help drive revenue growth throughout 2015 and well beyond. 
The other primary component of our Digital Segment, as you know, is CareerBuilder, the global leader in human capital solutions, which continues to be an integral part of our digital portfolio. It provides unmatched reach from employers by offering the largest online career destination in the U.S. for jobseekers and maintains the largest online recruitment sales presence in North America. 
CareerBuilder has been making significant investments over the past few years to further our transformation into a global leader in the HR Software-as-a-Service arena and as I mentioned last quarter, this is a growing source of CareerBuilder's increasing revenues. 
CareerBuilder has built the only global prehire Software-as-a-Service platform that addresses virtually all of an employer's significant prehire needs from attraction to candidate acquisition, to internal workflow, to candidate remarketing. 
CareerBuilder is uniquely positioned to provide this one-of-a-kind service. Having been a leader in recruitment advertising for years, the folks at CareerBuilder have invaluable insights into the needs of employers and the reasons why the efforts to fulfill those needs sometimes fail. By bringing together advertising, software and data into one integrated prehire platform, CareerBuilder is bringing a complete solution to the market that no one else in the industry can offer. 
Moving onto G/O Digital. This business again saw strong Q1 revenue traction year-over-year from small- to medium-sized business customers. Revenue from local advertisers rose over 32% versus last year, led by increases across key product solutions, including search, email and social marketing products. G/O Digital, which has won awards for its work on behalf of customers, has seen its client roster grow significantly over the past year. 
In light of the strong success of G/O Digital, the next logical step in its evolution is to create 2 distinct business efforts: G/O Digital local and G/O Digital national with separate leadership dedicate to each, along with a common shared services group to support both units. As innovation, excellent products and top-notch services have allowed G/O Digital to expand, each of these distinct revenue sources has evolved and become capable of thriving as a stand-alone business. 
Reorganizing G/O Digital's businesses drives better alignment with these 2 distinct markets and customer sets that we serve. Both business units have tremendous potential as high-growth, large revenue businesses. 
I mentioned earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a defining year in Gannett's history. The event we're all looking forward to is, of course, our planned separation into 2 publicly traded companies, which is on track to be completed in mid-2015. When our Publishing Segment becomes a stand-alone company later this year, one of the many strengths on which it will thrive as an exceptional leadership team led by Bob Dickey, as CEO and President. He and his team have launched just some terrific initiatives that are driving both audience engagement and revenue generation for publishing. Bob's going to review publishing's first quarter performance, and he'll also talk a little about the ""soon to be independent"" company. Bob?"

First, let me say how honored and excited I am to have been chosen to lead the new Gannett. I've been at this company for more than 2 decades. To tell you firsthand, this is a very exciting time not only for Gannett, but for publishing, specifically.
We've made significant strides in the past few years to provide our audiences with fresh content, to keep them engaged and then serve as an integral member of their local communities, all while continuing our long-held tradition of being a very strong operator. 
The response to new key concepts we've launched recently has been overwhelmingly positive and it encourages us to dig deeper and provide our audiences with increasingly new ways to consume the news and information they crave. We will continue to focus on innovation, finding creative approaches to producing and delivering superior content, all along engaging with subscribers and our communities and servicing, of course, our advertising partners. Not only will the new Gannett continue to push the envelope in terms of products and services, but we will begin our life as an independent company with strong financial footing, positioning us to be a successful consolidator of local market publishing and related digital operations in the future and invest in products and services that will drive growth.
We'll be financially disciplined, maintaining a strong flexible balance sheet through conscientious cost management, conservative financial policies and strong and efficient operations. The new publishing company will remain committed to preserving financial flexibility and maximizing cash flow to allow investments that enhance our company.
Focusing now on the first quarter. Our combination of award-winning journalism and innovative distribution methods kept Gannett atop the industry. The All Access Content Subscription Model continues to help drive circulation revenue as home delivery revenue was up in the quarter. It is also contributing to circulation volume and USA TODAY's position as the #1 in total daily circulation. USA TODAY local content editions have become must-reads in all the markets to which we've rolled them out so far. 
As we've mentioned, we've been partnering with other publishers to expand the reach of USA TODAY's high-quality content beyond Gannett's already expansive footprint. Since our last call, USA TODAY content has started running in a number of widely read news outlets, including the Chicago Sun-Times, the Knoxville News Sentinel, the Colorado Springs Gazette and The American News out of Aberdeen, South Dakota, the birth place of USA TODAY's very own Founder, Al Neuharth.
Total additional daily circulation is approximately 275,000 copies, while Sunday circulation is just over 891,000 additional. And negotiations continue with several other non-Gannett publishers. It's clear that the demand for our outstanding USA TODAY local-content edition is significant. We are leveraging this popularity by incorporating them into third-party news outlets, expanding our reach and gaining access to new communities that value USA TODAY's award-winning journalism. 
The industry is still up against the tough display advertising environment, but our talented team has done a great job of weathering the current environment to create value and provide our audiences with the critical news and information they demand from us on a daily basis on all platforms.
Turning to the quarterly results for the Publishing Segment. Overall, Publishing Segment revenues were down approximately 5% on a pro forma constant currency basis. The sequential improvement from the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter of 2014. Several factors unfavorably impacted year-over-year comparison, primarily continued softness in display advertising, the change in the Cars.com affiliate agreement economics, the absence of revenue associated with USA WEEKEND, Gannett Healthcare Group, Apartments.com and the commercial printing operation, as well as a year-over-year decline in the U.K. exchange rate.
While display advertising was down, digital revenue continued its substantial growth. The digital properties associated with the publishing business continue to perform very well. Pro forma domestic online advertising revenue in the Publishing Segment increased 7% year-over-year with retail advertising up 10% year-over-year, driven by G/O Digital with a growing base of customers seeking to diversify their marketing efforts, while increasing the efficiency of their online advertising solutions. National digital revenues also improved 11%. 
Newsquest online advertising was up an impressive 15%, mainly reflecting the strength of local and national display advertising. Publishing Segment's advertising revenues were impacted by secular pressure, again, this quarter and the absence of USA WEEKEND as well as the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group and Apartments.com. 
On a pro forma constant currency basis, Publishing Segment advertising was down approximately 7% with the year-over-year print advertising decline, partially offset by digital growth of 7%. 
Within the segment, domestic publishing advertising revenues decreased by 8% year-over-year, which was negatively impacted by lower advertising demand and a harsh winter weather impacts on retail sector advertising. In the U.K., Newsquest advertising declined by 4% year-over-year in local currency, but retail and national categories showed sequential improvements.
Publishing Segment circulation revenue was down 3% year-over-year due primarily to declines at USA TODAY and Newsquest. The ongoing strength of the All Access Content Subscription Model as well as our strategic pricing resulted in our local U.S. publishing site, home delivery circulation revenues to be higher compared to last year and helped USA TODAY maintained its #1 position in daily circulation, as Gracia mentioned. 
We continue to focus on cost efficiencies during the quarter and as a result, pro forma non-GAAP expenses were 4% lower. While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, we are optimistic about the initiatives we have in place and the reception has been even better than anticipated. We look forward to further stabilizing our publishing business as we continue to make positive progress executing our current strategy. 
Importantly, the publishing company also will have the financial flexibility to capitalize on new opportunities, backed by the brand trust, strong operations and journalistic talent that come with the Gannett name. Our team is incredibly excited about what lies ahead for the new Gannett. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Victoria to provide a detailed review of the financial results for Broadcasting and Digital Segments."

Before I review our financi",1150,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia already mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results, testament to the outstanding progress and the strategic transformation journey of our company. 
Before I review our financials as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which impacted the quarter to help provide additional context for our recurring performance trend. 
Our ongoing efforts to transform the business continue to generate greater operating efficiencies and effectiveness across the portfolio. These initiatives drove workforce and other restructurings across several of our businesses for a total of $13 million with an EPS impact of about $0.03 per share. Total nonoperating special items totaled $26 million with an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share, mainly related to a gain on the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group earlier this year. 
Now let's briefly review the ongoing operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. 
As Gracia mentioned, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the absence of significant Olympics and political advertising in broadcasting as well as $27 million of revenue previously associated with USA WEEKEND and the sale of Gannett Healthcare Group, which comprised about $20 million of the total, with the remainder comprised of Apartments.com and the sale of a commercial printing business. Additionally, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate declined by 8% year-over-year, impacting revenues by about $10 million and EPS by $0.01. Despite this, total company revenues of $1.5 billion, were up 5% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.2 billion, excluding special items, were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com, partially offset by our continued focus on efficiencies as well as lower volume in the Publishing Segment. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Broadcasting and Digital Segment results. As I mentioned, last year, we had $51 million of Olympic and political advertising in broadcasting during the first quarter, a challenging hurdle to overcome. Despite this tough comparison, we're very pleased with the broadcasting revenues, which were up 4% year-over-year, benefited by strong retransmission fees and record Super Bowl advertising revenues. Retransmission fees continue to grow substantially, up 26% as a result of new renegotiated agreements at the end of last year as well as annual increases within the existing agreements.
Broadcast digital revenues were up 11%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across our television stations as the newly acquired stations are now fully trained on G/O Digital products and seeing good sales results. 
Based on current trends, broadcast revenue in the second quarter is projected to be up in the mid-single digits compared to last year, again, despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons of $17 million in political advertising last year. 
During the quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 6% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to reverse compensation and investments in our digital sales initiatives
During the quarter, as mentioned, Digital Segment revenue increased about 85% year-over-year, driven by both the acquisition as well as the strong operating results of Cars.com, which was up 28%. On a pro forma basis, Digital Segment revenues were 10% higher, driven by the growth of Cars.com and continued growth at CareerBuilder, up 4% year-over-year. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were flat compared to last year on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead generation cost and better affiliate economics at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at CareerBuilder, offset by higher sales cost supporting associated revenue growth.
During the first quarter, company-wide digital revenues totaled $513 million, reflecting an increase of 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Digital revenues contributed fully 35% of total company revenues during the quarter, another historic high for Gannett. 
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $325 million increased 14% over last year. Broadcasting and Digital Segments accounted for nearly 85% of total company-wide EBITDA. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $130 million and each of our segments continues to be solidly profitable. 
During the quarter, we invested over $19 million in capital projects, primarily related to several local publishing real estate initiatives, which will generate about $4 million in annual operating cost savings as well as ongoing digital price developments, product integration and enhancements at both CareerBuilder and Cars.com. 
As we mentioned in our previous call, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million for the year with the majority of our capital investment dedicated to development of digital products and platform.
As we announced in February, we resumed our share buyback program well ahead of the time line we've previously anticipated, given the strength of our ongoing financial performance. As a result, we repurchased about 1.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $35.07 per share. 
As Gracia mentioned, the separation of our publishing business is quickly approaching. Last month, we filed our Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC, which is an important step in the separation process. You can find that filing in the Investor Relations page at Gannett's website or on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website under Gannett SpinCo, Inc. The Form 10 includes information regarding the transaction and the stand-alone publishing company.
As outlined in the Form 10, the publishing company expects to pay a regular cash dividend of $0.32 per share annually and plans to commence $150 million share repurchase program expected to be used over a 3-year period. The broadcasting and digital company will also continue Gannett's focus on delivering strong returns to shareholders, expect to pay a regular cash dividend of $0.56 annually, which, combined with the publishing company's anticipated dividend, represents a 10% increase over the current Gannett dividend. The broadcasting and digital company also plans to replace its existing share repurchase program with a new $750 million authorization program expected to be used over the 3-year period after the separation. 
This expected new authorization, combined with the publishing company's authorization, represents more than a doubling of the current Gannett share repurchase program. In addition, under the current plan, both companies will have leverage levels well below peer companies and will maintain the flexibility to address repurchases based on business conditions, new opportunities and other factors. 
During the quarter, we carried slightly higher interest expense related to a higher average debt balance due to Cars.com acquisition, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.4 billion. And after utilizing cash for debt and interest payments as well as share repurchases, we closed the quarter with $136 million of cash on the balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to Q&A."

There's a tremendous amount of innovation happening in our Digital Segment as both CareerBuilder and Cars.com explore new avenues of growth. Broadcast is performing well and the integration of our new stations is proceeding even better than we hoped, and we are on track to achieve at least, if not more, than the goal for our synergies. 
In publishing, our USA TODAY local content is really catching on, so much so that other publishers, as you heard Bob say, want our content in their publications, giving us access to previously untapped audiences and revenue sources. 
As 3 years of hard work, relentless focus and successful execution of our strategic transformation plan culminate in our separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies, the momentum we are currently generating will serve us well as we embark on the next chapter of the Gannett story.

As we said, we expect total revenues for the segment to be up in the mid-single digits. And as a Victoria pointed out, we'll be absent about $17 million of political. Publishing, on the publishing side, on a pro forma constant currency basis, because currency is really starting to have an impact, as I'm sure we're going to hear on lots of earnings calls. If you look at the ad revenues, it looks like, Bob, I'd say, they're about a percentage point or so better than what we saw in the first quarter, which was a percentage point or so better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. Currency, just to put it in perspective, the currency rate was down about 8% in the first quarter. Looking at where the pound is right at the moment, it looks like currency would be down around 11% or so in the second quarter. So obviously, that will have -- it costs us about $0.01 in EPS in the first quarter, so it'll probably cost us a bit more than that in the second quarter, obviously. Cars.com, I think we would expect to see, Jack, sort of the same range of revenue growth as we saw in the first quarter, 25-ish percent and CareerBuilder looks like it's traveling about the same as what we saw.

On the pension side, as we indicated in our Form 10, we tend to have the liabilities follow where the employees will end up post-spin. So given that the vast majority of our employees, who are in the pension plan, are retired or are current actives, emanated from the publishing side, more of that pension plan clearly is going to go to publishing. And we've outlined those numbers in the Form 10. Now obviously on the broadcasting and digital side, our digital businesses have never had a pension plan so there's no pension liabilities there. On the broadcast side, obviously with the acquisition of Belo, we picked up their plan as well as a few hundred million dollars of liability on the remainder of the broadcasting and corporate employees that will be associated with the broadcasting and digital company going forward. So have no real plans to change that. Our pension fund is well over 80% funded. When you look at the fact that we have a frozen plan and have had a frozen plan since 2008, with a return that is lower than the historical return we've ever generated on the plan, be it a 3, 5, 10, 20 or since inception in 1979, we have ample assets in the plan to pay out all of those liabilities. So we feel very good about where they will be. I think, post-spin, it looks like, at this point, the plan that will go to publishing will be even more funded than the 83 -- 82% or so that it's funded currently, and similarly on the broadcast and digital sides. So we feel very good about where we are on both plans."

So we are always looking at potential opportunities for great acquisitions that create shareholder value. That being said, I think given, as you mentioned, the spectrum auction and the uncertainty around the timing, et cetera, I think that it's probably put a little bit of a damper on M&A activity right now as I think everybody is trying to figure out ultimately what that auction will mean to them, whether in fact, their stations will have value or not. Frankly, when you look at what we think about where the highest congestion is, is really in that I-95 corridor from Boston down to Washington, up in L.A., San Francisco and some other areas. So I don't think that the auction is going to treat everybody the same. But I think that, certainly, out there is creating some hesitancy for folks to look at either selling their stations until they have a better grasp on how the auction is going to be run, when it's going to be run, what the rules are going to be and whether there is an opportunity or not for their stations. But we continue to be very bullish on the broadcast industry and with the right opportunity that we can see a clear path to creating shareholder value, we would be a buyer."

As you know, on June 29, the first day of our third quarter, we completed our anticipated separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies. A broadcasting and digital company operating under the name TEGNA and a publishing company that was given the name Gannett. Inc. As Jeff mentioned, our second quarter earnings release included -- includes considered consolidated results for the second quarter for our Broadcasting, Digital and publishing business segments. The new Gannett will hold its own investor call to provide an overview of their publishing results on July 29. Our focus on this morning's call will be on the businesses that comprise TEGNA as well as TEGNA's go-forward strategy and compelling investment thesis.
Before we cover our results for the quarter, I wanted to focus briefly on this morning's other good news. We are very pleased to share with you that we have signed a contract to sell TEGNA's headquarters building to the [indiscernible] group for $270 million. The deal is expected to close very late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter this year. As part of the proposed deal, TEGNA will occupy space in the building for 18 months from closing, rent-free. However, the counts -- for accounting purposes, we will need to report imputed rental expense.
Cash taxes on this transaction will be very minimal as we have a capital loss carryforward that will be utilized to offset the vast majority of the gain. We are reviewing the best alternatives for the use of proceeds from the sales, although no decisions have been finalized.
As you may know, we gave a deep dive on our businesses at our Investor Meeting on June 22. So we'll keep today's presentation relative brief. That said, obviously, this is an incredibly exciting time for all of us here at TEGNA. So let's get to it.
Our Broadcasting segment, now called TEGNA Media, achieved record second quarter revenues, despite challenging comps. Growth in Broadcasting was driven primarily by a very strong performance across our expanded portfolio of TV stations as the integration of our newer stations continues to unfold smoothly and exceed our expectations. 
Our TV footprint is expansive and our stations are strong on a variety of metrics as we continue to gain market share. As a result, core media advertising had another good quarter, fueling our growing optimism about our competitive positioning as we approach the 2016 mega-political season. 
2012, the last presidential year, was an outstanding year for us and since that time, we've doubled our Broadcasting footprint. So clearly, we have good reason to be excited about 2016 and beyond.
We are expecting tremendous demand in several of our markets as television advertising continues to be the go-to place for politicians in all areas of government and across all geographies in the U.S.
On top of that, as the largest owner of NBC affiliates, the summer Olympics in Rio should be yet another boom to our 2016 results. 
Another key events of our footprint is the opportunity it provides us in retransmission negotiations. As we said before, we believe there is a gap between the value of the content we provide and what we are paid for that content. And we think our strength, scale and deep local connections position us to close that gap further. That is a critical point as we will have approximately 90% of our paid subscribers up for renewal by the end of 2016.
These growth drivers also are especially beneficial as we face increased reverse retrans fees as we have important affiliation agreements coming up in late 2015 and early 2017. Of course, this is something we've been anticipating and planning for. And as we described at our Investor Day, we are putting several initiatives in place from both the top line and on the expense line to help maintain our industry-leading margins. We are confident that TEGNA Media is well positioned to more than compensate for any additional cost incurred due to this 2016 and beyond.
Along with our scale and other competitive advantages, our overall mission remains rooted in the idea that content comes first. We have award-winning local programming and a unique bond with the communities we serve. We are ratings leaders, well positioned to take market share and TEGNA Media will continue to make outstanding programming a priority, such as by investing in local news and other special programming to ensure we stay connected to our audiences wherever they want to access our content.
In addition, not only are we the largest most geographically diverse and often, the highest-rated station group, we also have the best margins in the industry. And given our operational strength and commitment to efficiency, that will not change in the foreseeable future. In fact, TEGNA Media has made already some innovative moves. We entered into a partnership [indiscernible], a subsidiary of Lion's Gate, to offer a preview of the TV hosted mainstream headline driven, 1-hour daytime talkshow across 4 TEGNA Media markets this summer. In addition to his own expansive TV, radio social and digital media platform, TV Jakes will utilize TEGNA Media's  large social media footprint to drive awareness of the show. This effort leverages multiple media channels, making it a perfect fit with TEGNA's commitment to innovation in the multi-platform model.
Just one day following the completion of the separation, TEGNA announces its investment in the video call center, a video technology and content company. This opportunity creates a new genre of television called video caller television in which entire programs are built with original content from video callers from anywhere in the world. As part of this center, TEGNA Media will use of BCC technology to create innovative original lower-cost programming across the broadcast, social, mobile and online. 
Ramping up our video capabilities has been an area of continuing focus for some time now. In April, we entered into an agreement with View Lift, a full-service provider of customer video application to explore the development of a new digital sports video service focused on streaming unique sports-related content and select relevant movies across multiple devices, smartphones, tablets, televisions and PCs. Under this agreement, View Lift will provide platform services, proprietary technology and complimentary content and operating expertise, while leveraging TEGNA's unparalleled footprint that reaches 1/3 of television households in America. 
These kinds of opportunities are very promising and they are relevant today, and we believe they will become even more significant in 2017 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn to our Digital Segment, now known as TEGNA Digital. TEGNA Digital had a strong and record second quarter with terrific revenue growth compared to the second quarter of '14. This substantial increase was driven primarily by strong organic growth, more favorable wholesale rates built into the new affiliate agreements signed in conjunction with the acquisition of Cars.com as well as increases in 2 very important metrics, the number of dealership customers and revenue per dealer.
We are also very pleased that Cars.com hit the 1 million mark for consumer generated dealer reviews during the quarter, just 4 years after the site feature was launched. This transparent and honest model for generating unbiased feedback, benefit all consumers and establishes their loyalty and trust, 2 of the reasons users come back to Cars.com, time and time again.
CareerBuilder, the other primary component of TEGNA is the human capital solutions with consistently strong cash flow generation over the last several years and virtually limitless opportunities in a rapidly growing sector. While CareerBuilder is expected to perform well in 2015, we anticipate growth will accelerate significantly in 2017 and beyond as we shift our focus away from transactional business and smaller advertising only deals and focus on more recurring software transaction and relationships, namely Software-as-a-Service solutions. 
And as I hinted at our Investor Day Presentation, CareerBuilder is continually looking for opportunities to expand its suite of products and further its evolution into an HR Software-as-a-Service provider. This morning, CareerBuilder announced they have acquired a majority stake in Tax Kernel, a software company based in Amsterdam that is doing some really innovative and exciting things in semantic search and matching for the HR arena. Employers and jobseekers often used different words or phrases to describe the same thing when they type in a search box, right job descriptions build their resume. 
The great thing about the Textkernel is that it uses language patterns to decipher what the user really means. As a result, the user gets the most relevant search results. 
This is very big in the recruitment space today. This small acquisition has a big impact and enables CareerBuilder to enhance all of its offerings by integrating advanced semantic search and matching capabilities. Its resume database, job-search and current and future software system will benefit from Textkernel. It enables CareerBuilder also to do this in multiple languages, which is very difficult. It also extends CareerBuilder's ability to help clients get more ROI from their internal candidate databases because Textkernel can convert any resume or social media profile into a complete and searchable profile. And finally, it expands CareerBuilder Supply & Demand offerings to global marketplace, solution, which measures the difficulty of the failing a position in a particular markets by comparing the number of jobs against the number of available candidates.
As I noted, this is just another step underscoring CareerBuilder's evolution into a global HR Software-as-a-Service. 
Moving onto G/O Digital, we, again, saw strong Q2 revenue transaction year-over-year from small- to medium-sized businesses customers. Revenue from local advertisers help drive a substantial increase in digital growth at TEGNA Media, led by increases across key product solutions, including search, e-mail and social marketing products and G/O Digital continues to expand its client roster.
As proud as we are of this past quarter, TEGNA is all about what's coming next. So before I turn it over to Victoria, who will provide a detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to articulate why our new board and leadership team are so excited about the future.
While June 29 marked the completion of the separation, the genesis of where we are today dates back more than 3.5 years ago to early 2012 when we first announced our strategic growth plan. At that time, we set out to accelerate growth in Broadcasting through added scale and expand our high potential Digital businesses, while remaining relentlessly focused on operating efficiency and asset optimization, all in the context of also returning capital to our shareholders and generating superior shareholder value creation. We have made significant achievements on all of those fronts. 
We have thoughtfully assessed our strength and leverage them, and we have doubled over scale in both Broadcasting and Digital by making hugely impactful acquisitions at very attractive valuations and have more than issued the synergies we anticipated for each of these acquisitions.
With powerful cash-generating assets and one nimble organizational and capital structure and a singular focus on high-growth businesses, TEGNA is poised to continue the strong performance we've seen over the last several quarters throughout the remainder of 2015 with the potential to accelerate that growth substantially in 2016 and beyond.
As I said at our Investor Day last month, TEGNA's investment thesis is simple, yet powerful. We have top-performing assets scale in the high growth, high margin Digital and Broadcasting Segments; we enjoy strong, consistent and dependable cash flow, which affords us ample flexibility to invest for growth both organically and through smart, disciplined M&A opportunities; and we have a shareholder focused capital structure that enables us to return attractive value to our investors, while at the same time, allocating cash to invest for our future growth and to accelerate that growth as well. 
With that, let me turn it over to Victoria."
20571,306164790,834980,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the second quarter financial results, a testament to the success of our strategic transformation journey that culminated with the spin at the beginning of the third quarter. As Gracia n",1170,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the second quarter financial results, a testament to the success of our strategic transformation journey that culminated with the spin at the beginning of the third quarter. 
As Gracia noted, my commentary this morning will focus on the Broadcast and Digital Segments. However, before I review consolidated financial results as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing special items, which are included in our results to help provide additional context for our ongoing performance trends. 
The company's ongoing efforts to consolidate and centralize functions to generate greater offering efficiencies throughout workforce restructuring, again of this quarter, primarily within the publishing businesses. Combined with our ongoing initiatives to transform the business and a write-down of our publishing investments resulted in total operating special items of $38 million with an EPS impact of $0.10 per share. Beyond these costs, total nonoperating special items totaled $7 million with an EPS impact of $0.02 per share driven by spin-related expenses associated with banking, legal and audit fees, offset in part by a gain from the acquisition of the remaining interest of Texas, New Mexico Newspapers Partnership.
Beyond this, we also recognized $87 million tax charge during the quarter, primarily rated to the restructuring of our legal entities as [indiscernible] by the spin with an EPS impact of $0.03 per share.
Now, let's with a review the ongoing operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our than the performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances from the Digital and Broadcast segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65 per share. As Gracia mentioned, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the absence of political advertising that benefited the broadcast segment in the second quarter last year and combined with lower results in the Publishing Segment, contributed to lower earnings per share by about $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Total company revenues of over $1.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, with record revenues for Digital and Broadcast segments for second quarter, which when combined, increased by 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.2 billion, excluding special items, were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com, although partially offset by lower Publishing Segment expense.
Although TEGNA did not exist on a stand-alone basis, during the second quarter, we estimate that pro forma revenue for TEGNA on a stand-alone basis would have been approximately $825 million and EBITDA would have been approximately $285 million, included the impacts of the transition service agreement that we entered into on the spin date with new Gannett, providing for cost recovers. We also anticipate a recurring tax rate on a stand-alone basis to be in the mid-30s given a loss of statutory tax benefits.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Broadcast and Digital Segment results for the second quarter, more specifically. As mentioned, during the second quarter of 2014, we enjoyed a $14 million incremental political advertising spend in Broadcasting, which provides a challenging year-over-year comparison. Despite this, we're very pleased with the Broadcast segment revenue this quarter, which were up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong retransmission fees and growth in Digital advertising revenues. 
A significant amount of that reaches mission fees continue to grow substantially, up fully 23% as a result of new renegotiated agreement at the end of last year as well as annual increases within the existing agreements.
Beyond this, Broadcast, Digital advertising revenues were also up 23%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continues to gain traction across our original television stations as well as those acquired through the Belo and London transactions. 
Looking ahead to third quarter, due to the even more challenging year-over-year comparisons to $40 million in political advertising revenues during the third quarter of last year, based on current trends, Broadcast segment revenue in the third quarter is projected to be down year-over-year, percentage-wise, in the low to mid-single digits.
During the second quarter, broadcast segment operating expenses were up 7% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to reverse compensation and investment in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offering.
During the second quarter, Digital Segment revenue increased by 74% year-over-year, or up 6% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economic in Cars.com, which was up in the mid-20s. This was offset in part by low single percentage decline in revenue at CareerBuilder, reflecting exchange rate conversion impacts as well as the strategic shift in product offerings there. 
As we outlined during our Investor Day call last month, CareerBuilder has begun to deemphasis transactional lower-margin sourcing and screening businesses to focus on broader Software-as-a-Service offerings, which provides for higher-margin, longer-term relationship for clients as valued partners. This transition will impact CareerBuilder growth rate as we invest $10 million to $15 million in additional sales and distribution resources in the second half of this year.
This will position CareerBuilder to grow sales, including Software-as-a-Service business and accelerated double-digit pace by the end of 2017, while improving EBITDA margins and customer retention through sticky, value-add offerings.
Digital Segment operating expenses were 4% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead generation cost and enhanced affiliate economics at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at Cars.com and CareerBuilder as they leverage companywide platform.
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $388 million increased by 10% year -- over last year. Adjusted EBITDA for Broadcast and Digital segments improved year-over-year and combined EBITDA, increased by 26%. 
During the quarter, we invested $36 million in capital projects with a majority of our capital investment dedicated to the development of digital products and platforms. Of that, over $20 million is spent on TEGNA-specific process, including Cars.com and CareerBuilder product offerings.
As I mentioned during the investor call last month, in order to position both TEGNA and new Gannett well, post-spin, we made $112 million contribution to the Gannett retirement plan during the quarter. We also repurchased over 1 million shares during the quarter for $38 million. Interest expense of $69 million was slightly higher over last year due our higher debt balance related to Cars.com acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rates, primarily due to attractive low interest rates related to the debt associated with that acquisition. 
Additionally, as we announced recently, we extended our $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement to 2020 and entered into a new, 5-year $200 million term loan arrangement for TEGNA with very favorable terms and conditions. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.45 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $219 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $156 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A. Gracia?"

Obviously, that will depend on foreign exchange rates and hopefully, foreign exchange rates have stabilized from here. But I think Matt talked about it in our Investor Day that we did make a strategic decision to reduce our dependency on sort of that lower margin transactional advertising and focus more on the longer-term stickier recurring revenue from Software-as-a-Service. That was accelerated I think for the most part, in the second quarter. So we expect that in the third quarter. it'll still have in an impact, but it will be a more muted impact given what we -- what was done in the second quarter. So we expect a return to revenue growth in the third quarter. But I think the more important thing from all of that is really why strategically we've done it and the pivoting of that business to more Software-as-a-Service. And we understand that it doesn't flatter the growth rate in '15, but it sets us up incredibly well, along with the increased investment we talked about in Investor Day of $10 million to $15 million for the remainder of the year in technology and sales resources to achieve accelerated growth in '16 and double-digit growth in revenue by the end of '17 and certainly, well into '18 and '19."

And let me join him in welcoming you to our earnings call this morning. As you know, on June 29, the first day of our third quarter, we completed our anticipated separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies. A broadcasting and digital company operating under the name TEGNA and a publishing company that was given the name Gannett Co., Inc. 
As Jeff mentioned, our second quarter earnings release included -- includes consolidated results for the second quarter for Broadcasting, Digital and Publishing business segments. New Gannett will hold its own investor call to provide an overview of their publishing results on July 29. Our focus on this morning's call will be on the businesses that comprise TEGNA as well as TEGNA's go-forward strategy and compelling investment thesis.
Before we cover our results for the quarter, I wanted to focus briefly on this morning's other good news. We are very pleased to share with you that we have signed a contract to sell TEGNA's headquarters building to the Tamares Group for $270 million. The deal is expected to close very late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of this year. As part of the proposed deal, TEGNA will occupy space in the building for 18 months from closing, rent-free. However, the account -- for accounting purposes, we will need to record imputed rental expense.
Cash taxes on this transaction will be very minimal as we have a capital loss carryforward that will be utilized to offset the vast majority of the gain. We are reviewing the best alternatives for the use of proceeds from the sale, although no decisions have been finalized.
As you may know, we gave a deep dive on our businesses at our Investor Meeting on June 22. So we'll keep today's presentation relatively brief. That said, obviously, this is an incredibly exciting time for all of us here at TEGNA. So let's get to it.
Our Broadcasting Segment, now called TEGNA Media, achieved record second quarter revenues, despite challenging comps. Growth in Broadcasting was driven primarily by a very strong performance across our expanded portfolio of TV stations as the integration of our newer stations continues to unfold smoothly and exceed our expectations. 
Our TV footprint is expansive and our stations are strong on a variety of metrics as we continue to gain market share. As a result, core media advertising had another good quarter, fueling our growing optimism about our competitive positioning as we approach the 2016 mega-political season. 
2012, the last presidential year, was an outstanding year for us. And since that time, we've doubled our Broadcasting footprint. So clearly, we have good reason to be excited about 2016 and beyond.
We are expecting tremendous demand in several of our markets as television advertising continues to be the go-to place for politicians in all areas of government and across all geographies in the U.S. On top of that, as the largest owner of NBC affiliates, the summer Olympics in Rio should be yet another boom to our 2016 results. 
Another key advantage of our footprint is the  opportunity it provides us in retransmission negotiations. As we said before, we believe there is a gap between the value of the content we provide and what we are paid for that content. And we think our strength, scale and deep local connections position us to close that gap further. That is a critical point as we will have approximately 90% of our paid subscribers up for renewal by the end of 2016.
These growth drivers also are especially beneficial as we face increased reverse retrans fees as we have important affiliation agreements coming up in late 2015 and early 2017. Of course, this is something we've been anticipating and planning for. And as we described at our Investor Day, we are putting several initiatives in place on both the top line and on the expense line to help maintain our industry-leading margins. We are confident that TEGNA Media is well positioned to more than compensate for any additional costs incurred due to this in 2016 and beyond.
Along with our scale and other competitive advantages, our overall mission remains rooted in the idea that content comes first. We have award-winning local programming and a unique bond with the communities we serve. We are ratings leaders, well positioned to take market share, and TEGNA Media will continue to make outstanding programming a priority, such as by investing in local news and other special programming to ensure we stay connected to our audiences wherever they want to access our content.
In addition, not only are we the largest, most geographically diverse and often the highest-rated station group, we also have the best margins in the industry. And given our operational strength and commitment to efficiency, that will not change in the foreseeable future. In fact, TEGNA Media has made already some innovative moves. We entered into a partnership with Debmar-Mercury, a subsidiary of Lionsgate, to offer a preview of a T.D. Jakes-hosted mainstream, headline-driven, 1-hour daytime talk show across 4 TEGNA Media markets this summer. In addition to his own expansive TV, radio, social and digital media platform, T.D. Jakes will utilize TEGNA Media's large social media footprint to drive awareness of the show. This effort leverages multiple media channels, making it a perfect fit with TEGNA's commitment to innovation in the multi-platform model.
Just one day following the completion of the separation, TEGNA announced its investment in The Video Call Center, a video technology and content company. This opportunity creates a new genre of television called video caller television in which entire programs are built with original content from video callers from anywhere in the world. As part of this venture, TEGNA Media will use VCC's technology to create innovative, original, lower-cost programming across broadcast, social, mobile and online. 
Ramping up our video capabilities has been an area of continuing focus for some time now. In April, we entered into an agreement with ViewLift, a full-service provider of custom video applications, to explore the development of a new digital sports video service focused on streaming unique sports-related content and select relevant movies across multiple devices, smartphones, tablets, televisions and PCs. Under this agreement, ViewLift will provide platform services, proprietary technology and complementary content and operating expertise, while leveraging TEGNA's unparalleled footprint that reaches 1/3 of television households in America. 
These kinds of opportunities are very promising and they are relevant today, and we believe they will become even more significant in 2017 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn to our Digital Segment, now known as TEGNA Digital. TEGNA Digital had a strong and record second quarter with terrific revenue growth compared to the second quarter of '14. This substantial increase was driven primarily by strong organic growth, more favorable wholesale rates built into the new affiliate agreements signed in conjunction with the acquisition of Cars.com as well as increases in 2 very important metrics, the number of dealership customers and revenue per dealer.
We are also very pleased that Cars.com hit the 1 million mark for consumer-generated dealer reviews during the quarter, just 4 years after the site feature was launched. This transparent and honest model for generating unbiased feedback, benefits all consumers and establishes their loyalty and trust, 2 of the reasons users come back to Cars.com time and time again.
CareerBuilder, the other primary component of TEGNA Digital, is the global leader in human capital solutions with consistently strong cash flow generation over the last several years and virtually limitless opportunities in a rapidly growing sector. While CareerBuilder is expected to perform well in 2015, we anticipate growth will accelerate significantly in 2017 and beyond as we shift our focus away from transactional business and smaller advertising-only deals, and focus on more recurring software transactions and relationships, namely Software-as-a-Service solutions. 
And as I hinted at during our Investor Day presentation, CareerBuilder is continually looking for opportunities to expand its suite of products and further its evolution into an HR Software-as-a-Service provider. This morning, CareerBuilder announced they have acquired a majority stake in Textkernel, a software company based in Amsterdam that is doing some really innovative and exciting things in semantic search and matching for the HR arena. Employers and job seekers often use different words or phrases to describe the same thing when they type in a search box, right job descriptions or build their resume. 
The great thing about Textkernel is that it uses language patterns to decipher what the user really means. As a result, the user gets the most relevant search results. 
This is very big in the recruitment space today. This small acquisition has a big impact and enables CareerBuilder to enhance all of its offerings by integrating advanced semantic search and matching capabilities. Its resume database, job search and current and future software systems will benefit from Textkernel. It enables CareerBuilder also to do this in multiple languages, which is very difficult. It also extends CareerBuilder's ability to help clients get more ROI from their internal candidate databases because Textkernel can convert any resume or social media profile into a complete and searchable profile. And finally, it expands CareerBuilder's supply and demand offering to global markets, a solution which measures the difficulty of filling a position in a particular market by comparing the number of jobs against the number of available candidates.
As I noted, this is just another step underscoring CareerBuilder's evolution into a global HR Software-as-a-Service company. 
Moving onto G/O Digital, we, again, saw strong Q2 revenue transaction year-over-year from small- to medium-sized businesses customers. Revenue from local advertisers help drive a substantial increase in digital growth at TEGNA Media, led by increases across key product solutions, including search, email and social marketing products, and G/O Digital continues to expand its client roster.
As proud as we are of this past quarter, TEGNA is all about what's coming next. So before I turn it over to Victoria, who will provide a detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to articulate why our new board and leadership team are so excited about the future.
While June 29 marked the completion of the separation, the genesis of where we are today dates back more than 3.5 years ago to early 2012 when we first announced our strategic growth plan. At that time, we set out to accelerate growth in broadcasting through added scale and expand our high potential digital businesses while remaining relentlessly focused on operating efficiency and asset optimization, all in the context of also returning capital to our shareholders and generating superior shareholder value creation. We have made significant achievements on all of those fronts. 
We have thoughtfully assessed our strength and leveraged them, and we have doubled over scale in both Broadcasting and Digital by making hugely impactful acquisitions at very attractive valuations and have more than achieved the synergies we anticipated for each of these acquisitions.
With powerful cash-generating assets on one nimble organizational and capital structure and a singular focus on high-growth businesses, TEGNA is poised to continue the strong performance we've seen over the last several quarters throughout the remainder of 2015 with the potential to accelerate that growth substantially in 2016 and beyond.
As I said at our Investor Day last month, TEGNA's investment thesis is simple, yet powerful. We have top-performing assets of scale in the high-growth, high-margin Digital and Broadcasting Segments. We enjoy strong, consistent and dependable cash flow, which affords us ample flexibility to invest for growth both organically and through smart, disciplined M&A opportunities; and we have a shareholder-focused capital structure that enables us to return attractive value to our investors while at the same time, allocating cash to invest for our future growth and to accelerate that growth as well. 
With that, let me turn it over to Victoria."
20571,306164790,835153,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter financial results, a testament to the success of our strategic transformation journey that culminated with the spin at the beginning of the third quarter. As Gracia n",1169,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter financial results, a testament to the success of our strategic transformation journey that culminated with the spin at the beginning of the third quarter. 
As Gracia noted, my commentary this morning will focus on the Broadcast and Digital Segments. However, before I review consolidated financial results as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which are included in our results to help provide additional context for our ongoing performance trends. 
The company's ongoing efforts to consolidate and centralize functions to generate greater operating efficiencies throughout workforce restructuring again this quarter, primarily within the publishing businesses. Combined with our ongoing initiatives to transform the business and a write-down of a publishing investment resulted in total operating special items of $38 million with an EPS impact of $0.10 per share. Beyond these costs, total nonoperating special items totaled $7 million with an EPS impact of $0.02 per share driven by spin-related expenses associated with banking, legal and audit fees, offset in part by a gain from the acquisition of the remaining interest of Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership.
Beyond this, we also recognized a $7 million tax charge during the quarter, primarily related to the restructuring of our legal entities as necessitated by the spin, with an EPS impact of $0.03 per share.
Now let's briefly review the ongoing operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances from the Digital and Broadcast segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65 per share. As Gracia mentioned, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the absence of political advertising that benefited the Broadcast Segment in the second quarter last year and combined with lower results in the Publishing Segment, contributed to lower earnings per share by about $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Total company revenues of over $1.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, with record revenues for Digital and Broadcast segments for second quarter, which when combined, increased by 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.2 billion, excluding special items, were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com, although partially offset by lower Publishing Segment expenses.
Although TEGNA did not exist on a stand-alone basis, during the second quarter, we estimate that pro forma revenue for TEGNA on a stand-alone basis would have been approximately $825 million and EBITDA would have been approximately $285 million, including the impacts of the transition service agreement that we entered into on the spin date with new Gannett, providing for cost recoveries. We also anticipate a recurring tax rate on a stand-alone basis to be in the mid-30s given the loss of U.K. statutory tax benefits.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Broadcast and Digital Segment results for the second quarter, more specifically. As mentioned, during the second quarter of 2014, we enjoyed a $14 million incremental political advertising spend in Broadcasting, which provides a challenging year-over-year comparison. Despite this, we're very pleased with the Broadcast Segment revenue this quarter, which were up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong retransmission fees and growth in Digital advertising revenues. 
It's significant to note that retransmission fees continue to grow substantially, up fully 23% as a result of newly negotiated agreements at the end of last year as well as annual increases within the existing agreements.
Beyond this, Broadcast, Digital advertising revenues were also up 23%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our original television station as well as those acquired through the Belo and London transactions. 
Looking ahead to third quarter, due to the even more challenging year-over-year comparisons to $40 million in political advertising revenues during the third quarter of last year, based on current trends, Broadcast Segment revenue in the third quarter is projected to be down year-over-year, percentage-wise, in the low to mid-single digits.
During the second quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 7% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to reverse compensation and investment in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings.
During the second quarter, Digital Segment revenue increased by 74% year-over-year, or up 6% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economic in Cars.com, which was up in the mid-20s. This was offset in part by low-single percentage decline in revenue at CareerBuilder, reflecting exchange rate conversion impacts as well as the strategic shift in product offerings there. 
As we outlined during our Investor Day call last month, CareerBuilder has begun to deemphasize transactional, lower-margin sourcing and screening businesses to focus on broader Software-as-a-Service offerings, which provides for higher-margin, longer-term relationships with clients as valued partners. This transition will impact CareerBuilder growth rate as we invest $10 million to $15 million in additional sales and distribution resources in the second half of this year.
This will position CareerBuilder to grow sales, including Software-as-a-Service business and accelerated double-digit pace by the end of 2017, while improving EBITDA margin and customer retention through sticky, value-add offerings.
Digital Segment operating expenses were 4% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead generation costs and enhanced affiliate economics at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at Cars.com and CareerBuilder as they leverage companywide platforms.
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $388 million increased by 10% year -- over last year. Adjusted EBITDA for Broadcast and Digital segments improved year-over-year, and combined EBITDA increased by 26%. 
During the quarter, we invested $36 million in capital projects with the majority of our capital investments dedicated to the development of digital products and platforms. Of that, over $20 million is spent on TEGNA-specific projects, including Cars.com and CareerBuilder product offerings.
As I mentioned during the investor call last month, in order to position both TEGNA and new Gannett well, post-spin, we made $112 million contribution to the Gannett retirement plan during the quarter. We also repurchased over 1 million shares during the quarter for $38 million. Interest expense of $69 million was slightly higher over last year due to our higher debt balance related to the Cars.com acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rates, primarily due to attractive low interest rates related to the debt associated with that acquisition. 
Additionally, as we announced recently, we extended our $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement to 2020 and entered into a new, 5-year $200 million term loan arrangement for TEGNA with very favorable terms and conditions. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.45 billion and cash on our balance sheet was $219 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $156 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A. Gracia?"

Gracia said exactly correct about getting the appropriate value. As we've said, that new entrants, especially the new entrants into the OTT space, as we said at Investor Day, are an opportunity for us to reset together with the networks the appropriate value for our collective linear stream. And that would be what I would focus on is our collective linear stream. That is a tremendous value to consumers regardless of the platform and have shown to be historically so. What I would -- in preparation for the types of deals that Mike had struck, what I'd point out -- what I would divorce from it a little bit is nonlinear playing of network programs. That's not a new issue, right, whether it's been Apple TV or Netflix or other things. But as -- we said at Investor Day, for us, network prime time programming, excluding sports, now represents less than -- well less than 20% of our core spot revenues. So that's going to be almost less than 10% of our total net revenues. So what we're focused on is the appropriate value for the aggregate linear stream. It's in the network's interest to do that with us and it's in our interest to do that with the networks. And I won't talk about who's negotiating with who, but there's a lot of conversations taking place and for the -- in the markets that the networks don't own, they need to the participation of the affiliates to get where the provider and the network wants to go."

And let me join him in welcoming you to our earnings call this morning. As you know, on June 29, the first day of our third quarter, we completed our anticipated separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies. A broadcasting and digital company operating under the name TEGNA and a publishing company that was given the name Gannett Co., Inc. 
As Jeff mentioned, our second quarter earnings release included -- includes consolidated results for the second quarter for Broadcasting, Digital and Publishing business segments. New Gannett will hold its own investor call to provide an overview of their publishing results on July 29. Our focus on this morning's call will be on the businesses that comprise TEGNA as well as TEGNA's go-forward strategy and compelling investment thesis.
Before we cover our results for the quarter, I wanted to focus briefly on this morning's other good news. We are very pleased to share with you that we have signed a contract to sell TEGNA's headquarters building to the Tamares Group for $270 million. The deal is expected to close very late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of this year. As part of the proposed deal, TEGNA will occupy space in the building for 18 months from closing, rent-free. However, the account -- for accounting purposes, we will need to record imputed rental expense.
Cash taxes on this transaction will be very minimal as we have a capital loss carryforward that will be utilized to offset the vast majority of the gain. We are reviewing the best alternatives for the use of proceeds from the sale, although no decisions have been finalized.
As you may know, we gave a deep dive on our businesses at our Investor Meeting on June 22, so we'll keep today's presentation relatively brief. That said, obviously, this is an incredibly exciting time for all of us here at TEGNA. So let's get to it.
Our Broadcasting Segment, now called TEGNA Media, achieved record second quarter revenues, despite challenging comps. Growth in Broadcasting was driven primarily by a very strong performance across our expanded portfolio of TV stations as the integration of our newer stations continues to unfold smoothly and exceed our expectations. 
Our TV footprint is expansive and our stations are strong on a variety of metrics as we continue to gain market share. As a result, core media advertising had another good quarter, fueling our growing optimism about our competitive positioning as we approach the 2016 mega-political season. 
2012, the last presidential year, was an outstanding year for us. And since that time, we've doubled our Broadcasting footprint. So clearly, we have good reason to be excited about 2016 and beyond.
We are expecting tremendous demand in several of our markets as television advertising continues to be the go-to place for politicians in all areas of government and across all geographies in the U.S. On top of that, as the largest owner of NBC affiliates, the summer Olympics in Rio should be yet another boon to our 2016 results. 
Another key advantage of our footprint is the opportunity it provides us in retransmission negotiations. As we've said before, we believe there is a gap between the value of the content we provide and what we are paid for that content. And we think our strength, scale and deep local connections position us to close that gap further. That is a critical point as we will have approximately 90% of our paid subscribers up for renewal by the end of 2016.
These growth drivers also are especially beneficial as we face increased reverse retrans fees as we have important affiliation agreements coming up in late 2015 and early 2017. Of course, this is something we've been anticipating and planning for. And as we described at our Investor Day, we are putting several initiatives in place on both the top line and on the expense line to help maintain our industry-leading margins. We are confident that TEGNA Media is well positioned to more than compensate for any additional costs incurred due to this in 2016 and beyond.
Along with our scale and other competitive advantages, our overall mission remains rooted in the idea that content comes first. We have award-winning local programming and a unique bond with the communities we serve. We are ratings leaders, well positioned to take market share, and TEGNA Media will continue to make outstanding programming a priority, such as by investing in local news and other special programming to ensure we stay connected to our audiences wherever they want to access our content.
In addition, not only are we the largest, most geographically diverse and often the highest-rated station group, we also have the best margins in the industry. And given our operational strength and commitment to efficiency, that will not change in the foreseeable future. In fact, TEGNA Media has made already some innovative moves. We entered into a partnership with Debmar-Mercury, a subsidiary of Lionsgate, to offer a preview of a T.D. Jakes-hosted mainstream, headline-driven, 1-hour daytime talk show across 4 TEGNA Media markets this summer. In addition to his own expansive TV, radio, social and digital media platform, T.D. Jakes will utilize TEGNA Media's large social media footprint to drive awareness of the show. This effort leverages multiple media channels, making it a perfect fit with TEGNA's commitment to innovation in the multi-platform model.
Just one day following the completion of the separation, TEGNA announced its investment in The Video Call Center, a video technology and content company. This opportunity creates a new genre of television called video caller television in which entire programs are built with original content from video callers from anywhere in the world. As part of this venture, TEGNA Media will use VCC's technology to create innovative, original, lower-cost programming across broadcast, social, mobile and online. 
Ramping up our video capabilities has been an area of continuing focus for some time now. In April, we entered into an agreement with ViewLift, a full-service provider of custom video applications, to explore the development of a new digital sports video service focused on streaming unique sports-related content and select relevant movies across multiple devices: smartphones, tablets, televisions and PCs. Under this agreement, ViewLift will provide platform services, proprietary technology and complementary content and operating expertise while leveraging TEGNA's unparalleled footprint that reaches 1/3 of television households in America. 
These kinds of opportunities are very promising and they are relevant today, and we believe they will become even more significant in 2017 and beyond.
Now I'd like to turn to our Digital Segment, now known as TEGNA Digital. TEGNA Digital had a strong and record second quarter with terrific revenue growth compared to the second quarter of '14. This substantial increase was driven primarily by strong organic growth, more favorable wholesale rates built into the new affiliate agreements signed in conjunction with the acquisition of Cars.com as well as increases in 2 very important metrics, the number of dealership customers and revenue per dealer.
We are also very pleased that Cars.com hit the 1 million mark for consumer-generated dealer reviews during the quarter, just 4 years after the site feature was launched. This transparent and honest model for generating unbiased feedback benefits all consumers and establishes their loyalty and trust, 2 of the reasons users come back to Cars.com time and time again.
CareerBuilder, the other primary component of TEGNA Digital, is the global leader in human capital solutions with consistently strong cash flow generation over the last several years and virtually limitless opportunities in a rapidly growing sector. While CareerBuilder is expected to perform well in 2015, we anticipate growth will accelerate significantly in 2017 and beyond as we shift our focus away from transactional business and smaller advertising-only deals, and focus on more recurring software transactions and relationships, namely Software-as-a-Service solutions. 
And as I hinted at during our Investor Day presentation, CareerBuilder is continually looking for opportunities to expand its suite of products and further its evolution into an HR Software-as-a-Service provider. This morning, CareerBuilder announced they have acquired a majority stake in Textkernel, a software company based in Amsterdam that is doing some really innovative and exciting things in semantic search and matching for the HR arena. Employers and job seekers often use different words or phrases to describe the same thing when they type in a search box, write job descriptions or build their resumes.
The great thing about Textkernel is that it uses language patterns to decipher what the user really means. As a result, the user gets the most relevant search results. 
This is very big in the recruitment space today. This small acquisition has a big impact and enables CareerBuilder to enhance all of its offerings by integrating advanced semantic search and matching capabilities. Its resume database, job search and current and future software systems will benefit from Textkernel. It enables CareerBuilder also to do this in multiple languages, which is very difficult. It also extends CareerBuilder's ability to help clients get more ROI from their internal candidate databases because Textkernel can convert any resume or social media profile into a complete and searchable profile. And finally, it expands CareerBuilder's supply and demand offering to global markets, a solution which measures the difficulty of filling a position in a particular market by comparing the number of jobs against the number of available candidates.
As I noted, this is just another step underscoring CareerBuilder's evolution into a global HR Software-as-a-Service company. 
Moving onto G/O Digital, we again saw strong Q2 revenue transaction year-over-year from small- to medium-sized business customers. Revenue from local advertisers helped drive a substantial increase in digital growth at TEGNA Media, led by increases across key product solutions, including search, email and social marketing products, and G/O Digital continues to expand its client roster.
As proud as we are of this past quarter, TEGNA is all about what's coming next. So before I turn it over to Victoria, who will provide a detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to articulate why our new board and leadership team are so excited about the future.
While June 29 marked the completion of the separation, the genesis of where we are today dates back more than 3.5 years ago to early 2012 when we first announced our strategic growth plan. At that time, we set out to accelerate growth in broadcasting through added scale and expand our high-potential digital businesses while remaining relentlessly focused on operating efficiency and asset optimization, all in the context of also returning capital to our shareholders and generating superior shareholder value creation. We have made significant achievements on all of those fronts. 
We have thoughtfully assessed our strengths and leveraged them, and we have doubled over scale in both Broadcasting and Digital by making hugely impactful acquisitions at very attractive valuations and have more than achieved the synergies we anticipated for each of these acquisitions.
With powerful cash-generating assets, a more nimble organizational and capital structure and a singular focus on high-growth businesses, TEGNA is poised to continue the strong performance we've seen over the last several quarters throughout the remainder of 2015 with the potential to accelerate that growth substantially in 2016 and beyond.
As I said at our Investor Day last month, TEGNA's investment thesis is simple, yet powerful. We have top-performing assets of scale in the high-growth, high-margin Digital and Broadcasting segments. We enjoy strong, consistent and dependable cash flow, which affords us ample flexibility to invest for growth, both organically and through smart, disciplined M&A opportunities; and we have a shareholder-focused capital structure that enables us to return attractive value to our investors while at the same time allocating cash to invest for our future growth and to accelerate that growth as well. 
With that, let me turn it over to Victoria."

We're very pleased with our second quarter financial results, a testament to the success of our strategic transformation journey that culminated with the spin at the beginning of the third quarter. As Gracia n",1171,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter financial results, a testament to the success of our strategic transformation journey that culminated with the spin at the beginning of the third quarter. 
As Gracia noted, my commentary this morning will focus on the Broadcast and Digital segments. However, before I review consolidated financial results as well as our capital allocation efforts during the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing several special items, which are included in our results to help provide additional context for our ongoing performance trends. 
The company's ongoing efforts to consolidate and centralize functions to generate greater operating efficiencies through our workforce restructurings again this quarter, primarily within the publishing businesses. Combined with our ongoing initiatives to transform the business and a write-down of a publishing investment resulted in total operating special items of $38 million with an EPS impact of $0.10 per share. Beyond these costs, total nonoperating special items totaled $7 million with an EPS impact of $0.02 per share driven by spin-related expenses associated with banking, legal and audit fees, offset in part by a gain from the acquisition of the remaining interest of Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership.
Beyond this, we also recognized a $7 million tax charge during the quarter, primarily related to the restructuring of our legal entities as necessitated by the spin, with an EPS impact of $0.03 per share.
Now let's briefly review the ongoing operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances from the Digital and Broadcast segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65 per share. As Gracia mentioned, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the absence of political advertising that benefited the Broadcast Segment in the second quarter of last year and, combined with lower results in the Publishing Segment, contributed to lower earnings per share by about $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Total company revenues of over $1.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, with record revenues for Digital and Broadcast segments for second quarter, which when combined, increased by 27% year-over-year.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $1.2 billion, excluding special items, were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com, although partially offset by lower Publishing Segment expenses.
Although TEGNA did not exist on a stand-alone basis, during the second quarter, we estimate that pro forma revenue for TEGNA on a stand-alone basis would have been approximately $825 million and EBITDA would have been approximately $285 million, including the impacts of the transition service agreements that we entered into on the spin date with new Gannett, providing for cost recoveries. We also anticipate a recurring tax rate on a stand-alone basis to be in the mid-30s given the loss of U.K. statutory tax benefits.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Broadcast and Digital Segment results for the second quarter more specifically. As mentioned, during the second quarter of 2014, we enjoyed a $14 million incremental political advertising spend in Broadcasting, which provides a challenging year-over-year comparison. Despite this, we're very pleased with the Broadcast Segment revenues this quarter, which were up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong retransmission fees and growth in Digital advertising revenues. 
It's significant to note that retransmission fees continue to grow substantially, up fully 23% as a result of newly negotiated agreements at the end of last year as well as annual increases within the existing agreements.
Beyond this, Broadcast, Digital advertising revenues were also up 23%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across our original television station as well as those acquired through the Belo and London transactions. 
Looking ahead to third quarter, due to the even more challenging year-over-year comparisons to $40 million in political advertising revenues during the third quarter of last year, based on current trends, Broadcast Segment revenue in the third quarter is projected to be down year-over-year, percentage-wise, in the low- to mid-single digits.
During the second quarter, Broadcast Segment operating expenses were up 7% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to reverse compensation and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings.
During the second quarter, Digital Segment revenue increased by 74% year-over-year, or up 6% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economics in Cars.com, which was up in the mid-20s. This was offset in part by low-single percentage decline in revenue at CareerBuilder, reflecting exchange rate conversion impacts as well as the strategic shift in product offerings there. 
As we outlined during our Investor Day call last month, CareerBuilder has begun to deemphasize transactional, lower-margin sourcing and screening businesses to focus on broader Software-as-a-Service offerings, which provide for higher-margin, longer-term relationships with clients as valued partners. This transition will impact CareerBuilder growth rates as we invest $10 million to $15 million in additional sales and distribution resources in the second half of this year.
This will position CareerBuilder to grow sales, including Software-as-a-Service business and accelerated double-digit pace by the end of 2017, while improving EBITDA margin and customer retention through sticky, value-add offerings.
Digital Segment operating expenses were 4% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, reflecting lower lead generation costs and enhanced affiliate economics at Cars.com as well as cost efficiencies at Cars.com and CareerBuilder as they leverage company-wide platforms.
Total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $388 million increased by 10% year -- over last year. Adjusted EBITDA for Broadcast and Digital segments improved year-over-year, and combined EBITDA increased by 26%. 
During the quarter, we invested $36 million in capital projects, with the majority of our capital investments dedicated to the development of digital products and platforms. Of that, over $20 million was spent on TEGNA-specific projects, including Cars.com and CareerBuilder product offerings.
As I mentioned during the investor call last month, in order to position both TEGNA and new Gannett well, post-spin, we made $112 million contribution to the Gannett retirement plan during the quarter. We also repurchased over 1 million shares during the quarter for $38 million. Interest expense of $69 million was slightly higher over last year due to a higher debt balance related to the Cars.com acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rates, primarily due to attractive low interest rates related to the debt associated with that acquisition. 
Additionally, as we announced recently, we extended our $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement to 2020 and entered into a new, 5-year $200 million term loan arrangement for TEGNA with very favorable terms and conditions. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.45 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $219 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $156 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A. Gracia?"

Obviously that will depend on foreign exchange rates and hopefully foreign exchange rates have stabilized from here.

It'll still have an impact, but it will be a more muted impact given what we -- what was done in the second quarter. So we expect a return to revenue growth in the third quarter. But I think the more important thing from all of that is really why strategically we've done it and the pivoting of that business to more Software-as-a-Service.

That's not a new issue, right, whether it's been Apple TV or Netflix or other things. But as -- we said at Investor Day, for us, network prime time programming, excluding sports, now represents less than -- well less than 20% of our core spot revenues.

We can now do a show that's ubiquitous across all platforms simultaneously. Down the line, we actually see a potential ecosystem around e-commerce related to some of these local programs. And to your point, if the shows become valuable enough to consumers, it also gives us additional leverage in subscriber negotiations, regardless of the platform."

And Cars.com has far exceeded the entire category in terms of the volume of people downloading our apps and our mobile devices. When we look at the time spent, Cars.com average shoppers are spending north of 12 minutes per visit and they're coming back more than 2.5x per month vis-à-vis some of the sites that are positioned more as a buying service or a broker model, where it's very transactional, very low time spent and used almost as a point-of-sale tool.

So today marks the first time we are reportin",720,"Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone, and let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are reporting results as our standalone media and digital company. We are very excited about this milestone and about the terrific progress we've made in just the last 90 days or so since the close. So let's jump right into the morning's agenda. 
As you saw in our press release this morning, company-wide revenue grew to $807 million, reflecting an increase of almost 19% over last year. This is the result of a record revenue growth at TEGNA Digital and a solid performance at TEGNA Media despite the challenge of overcoming $40 million in political advertising in the third quarter last year. 
Expenses were higher, as you saw when including the acquisition, but our pro forma basis were down almost 2%. As you can see, even as our operation scale up, we continue to be very disciplined in ensuring that we are operating as efficiently as possible. As you also saw this morning, earnings were $0.39 on a GAAP basis, including $0.02 related to a special tax benefit and were $0.37 per share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding net of benefit. This compares to $0.29 during the same period last year, reflecting an improvement of approximately 28%. 
We also continue to generate considerable cash from our operations. Free cash flow totaled $164 million. This has translated into a substantial direct return to our shareholders as we have paid dividends totaling $76 million and repurchased approximately 5 million shares since our separation on June 29. 
Let's focus for a moment on capital allocation. Hopefully, you saw our second press release this morning. With the close on the sale of our headquarters building here in MacLean, the board approved a $75 million increase to our $750 million share repurchase authorization to be used over the original 3-year period. We will use the balance of the net proceeds to reduce debt, which Victoria will share with you in a few moments. As a reminder, we sold the building for $270 million, we'll have a gain of approximately $80 million to $90 million in the fourth quarter and we'll pay a de minimis portion of that amount in taxes. 
We should also remind you that we sold a parcel of land here several years ago for $50 million. Moving to our business segments. TEGNA Media achieved revenues at the favorable end of our previous guidance, driven by core advertising, revenue growth and double-digit revenue growth in retransmission and digital revenues. Overall, revenues were down slightly compared to a record third quarter last year that benefited from the aforementioned significant political revenue. 
While there obviously, wasn't enough political ad spend this quarter to beat a tough 2014 comparison, TEGNA is very well positioned in key battle ground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward. We expect to see some political advertising in the fourth quarter this year, but we of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016. 
As again, you saw a retransmission revenue was up significantly as I noted over last year's third quarter. Other than normal seasonality, our subscriber numbers have been steady and we remain confident in our previous guidance on retrans revenues. In fact, earlier this month, we reached a multi-year agreement with DISH Network for their continued carriage of TEGNA stations. 
On a related note, we were pleased to announce the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. As a reminder, we are the #1 CBS affiliated group. As part of the renewal, we signed TEGNA up to participate in the CBS All Access video on demand service. Partnering with CVS on both of these fronts is just one way to ensure that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see contents on all of their devices. 
One important note, the outcome of both the CBS affiliation agreement and the DISH negotiations are consistent with the long-term projections we provided at our Investor Day in June. 
Now let me ask Dave Lougee to share some of what we have been working on in TEGNA Media. Dave?"

At TEGNA Media, our strong performance and successful negotiations are driven by our relentless loyalty to our audiences and advertisers. Increasingly, we're using consumer data tools to drive editorial, marketing, content and ad sales decisions. With a wide reaching set of consumer analytics that we use both at the corporate and local levels, we're creating deeper, more meaningful connections with all of our stakeholders, viewers, users, followers and clients. 
Don't forget that works from a mobile perspective. Last year, we released strong apps into the marketplace, but with an intense metrics based focused on downloads, app store ratings, page views, video views and more. We went back to the drawing board and have started moving our apps onto a new and highly improved mobile platform. We've already migrated about half our stations in this new platform and the results have been spectacular. In the first few weeks, post-migration, 9 of our top 10 stations are rated above 4 stars in the iOS app store and the average star rating for our apps jumped to 4.2 and this is just the beginning. 
From a content perspective, our teams are now making editorial decisions using technology to interact with consumers in real time. Through new social listing tools and digital dashboards right in the depth of our content producers, we're producing content and shows that integrate audience feedback and rely more heavily than ever on user-generated content. Tools like crowd tangle, tag board and others are improving our products across every platform. This approach has helped us realize consumer growth on every screen. 
Our social following is up over 11 million consumers plus 72%. Our mobile page views are up nearly 70% year-to-date. Between the Olympics, the presidential election and other key programming, we see plenty more opportunities for digital growth throughout 2016. So when you have the content audiences want, distributed on all the platforms and devices they use, advertisers will come calling, which is why we've also made great strides in bolstering and streamlining our sales and marketing functions. 
With the new business analytics team in place along a new centralized sales and marketing function, we can deliver insight-based client solutions at scale. These 2 teams are working hand in hand to deliver multiplatform solutions to clients across categories, across content and across our markets. Every solution we're sending the marketplace is now backed by a massive data machine that generates meaningful audience insights, and these insights, local advertisers would not otherwise have access to and our stations are empowering them now with creative solutions to turn those insights into dollars."

Growth was driven by the acquisition of Cars.com and the impressive organic growth within that business. In addition, degenerated substantial revenue growth in its Software-as-a-Service products in the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, CareerBuilder is bringing to market the only global prehire Software-as-a-Service platform, combining CareerBuilder's world advertising products together with software and analytics to create an integrated, seamless and efficient process for recruiters. 
The company Software-as-a-Service platform is an addition to the product line, not a departure from the core business. While advertising remains and will always be a significant portion of the CareerBuilder prehire platform, CareerBuilder made the strategic decision in 2015 to stop supporting certain low-margin advertising and services customers with intermittent needs -- for customers with intermittent needs that do not have the same, long-term profit margins as those organizations with more steady recruitment efforts. 
Our outlook on our Software-as-a-Service business remains very strong and our current expectations remain in line with what we discussed at our Investor Day in June, specifically that we expect accelerated growth at CareerBuilder in 2016 and double-digit growth by the end of 2017. 
Matt Ferguson, the longtime successful CEO of CareerBuilder is here to discuss those opportunities. Matt?"

I'm excited to be here today and talk about CareerBuilder building the world's first and world's only prehire platform.

I'm excited to be here today and talk about CareerBuilder building the world's first and world's only prehire platform. This prehire platform starts with advertising and includes many software services like career sites, candidate relationship management, job distribution, workforce analytics, applicant tracking systems and semantic search. No one else has this portfolio of software solutions. 
We have seen significant growth in our software in 2015 and we believe that will continue in 2016. Overall in 2015, we'll be slightly more than $700 million in revenue and we believe we are set up to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% in 2016 versus 2015. In 2015, we are estimating that CareerBuilder revenue will basically be flat versus 2014 when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Moreover, we knew this -- we knew our growth this year would slow as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions. For example, we will be down almost $17 million in revenue or about 2.5 percentage points of revenue growth in 2015 versus 2014 in our employer services category where we source and screen candidates for companies. We stopped telling our transactional source and screen business in January and have focused on platforms source and screen business only. We exited the transactional source and screen business because it was low-margin and hard to scale. Instead we have focused in 2015 on platforms source and screen business where the customer commits to a longer period of time and we can build software into the solutions. 
This platform stores and screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months and we have a very strong pipeline of new platform source and screen business. We believe this business will grow around $7 million in 2016, a percentage point or so a growth in 2016. Therefore, just looking at our employer services business, we believe we will see a 3 percentage point improvement in revenue run rate in 2016 versus 2015 going from $17 million revenue decline to a $7 million revenue growth. 
We were also hurt in 2015 by moving some low-margin transactional job advertising business. We moved several transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force in the spring into a group that focuses both exclusively on these accounts. These accounts were declining and not getting much attention in the field sales force. The move itself was disruptive to all the customers and some of the business was also not a fit for us going forward. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining. However, the move and these accounts are still weighing on 2015 results. 
If you look at our business, taking out the currency impact, removing source and screen revenue and removing the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to the specialized group, our business is actually up approximately 2% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2014. Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we've included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunity to still go after more job volume, although we acknowledge that the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled categories of jobs. 
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions resume database in 2015. We expect our software resume database solutions to grow in 2015 and 2016, with a more seasoned sales force selling the software and the significant enhancements we can do to make our software and our resume database. Today, CareerBuilder officially launched a new candidate sourcing solution. The first and only tool that enables each of our leaders to search resumes across all internal and external candidate databases and professional network sites in a single interface. It's a huge plus for increasing recruiter efficiency. CareerBuilder add semantic search, skills enhancement, skill extraction, classification, no other system does this today, so we're very excited about how this can change the recruiter experience for the better and reinforce CareerBuilder's place as the innovative leader of the pack. 
This solution is part of the broader, software suite that CareerBuilder has developed that is unparalleled. There is no doubt 2015 has been a transition year for our business as we move significantly and to improved portfolio of software and other platform solutions. We believe we are through most of that transition are set up for growth again in 2016. We are excited about the opportunities for growth in the prehire platform, bringing solutions to customers that no one else has. We believe that this will lead to 5% to 7% growth in 2016 and move towards 10% growth by the end of 2017"

Just 2 of the innovative products that we rolled out in 2015 include repair pal service hides and event positions, which are performing even better than we had projected. RepairPal certified is driving cars.com's entrance into the service category while event positions is a new ad unit with an emphasis on mobile that provides dealers, customers an opportunity to dominate a specific, targeted geography for a 70-day period. Total expenses for Cars.com were down and profitability was up sharply as a result. 
Even as we introduce new products and services, we continue to operate as efficiently as possible and is showing on our bottom line. The game plan at Cars.com right now is to keep innovating whether it's introducing new products to our customers, finding creative ways to access new markets or building out our platform and capabilities in mobile and changing the way we operate and manage the business. Everything is about adapting to and staying ahead of an evolving digital environment. For instance, cars.com has been replatform its website to provide consumers with a responsibly design, consistent and tailored experience across all devices. 
In fact, we've seen a considerable rise in mobile traffic, which led to a recent comScore report that rank Cars.com #1 mobile app first in the third-party, automotive resources category, both for a number of unique visitors and engagement, which is measured by the average length of time that visitors spend on our app. The heavier traffic on the app was the recently redesigned mobile app website, contributed to an overall increase and impressions delivered, which bolsters our national ad revenue. 
During the quarter, Cars.com launched a pioneering report for our dealer customers that enables them to view the total number of unique visitors, to the Cars.com mobile platform, within close proximity of their dealerships. This report, which we're calling Lott Insights is the first of the kind of -- it's kind in our industry to use geo- fencing technology to quantify the influence Cars.com has on walk-in customers. Connecting the online shopping to the in-store experience, a metric that moves us beyond basic forms of lead measurement and positions us for future growth. 
With that, let me turn over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our third quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political spending tha",1489,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our third quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political spending that benefited us during the third quarter of 2014. However, we're proud of our financial and operational performance this quarter, our very first as a separate company. The strength of our underlying business drivers demonstrated during the quarter gives us great confidence in the future and are solidly consistent with the same trajectory and financial projections we provided to you in June, during Investor Day. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight just one special item, reflecting a spin related tax benefit of $6 million with an EPS impact of about $0.02 per share. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 33.8% was fairly consistent with the mid-30s range previously projected driven higher than last year and on an ongoing basis by the absence of the lower tax rate on U.K. earnings subsequent to the spin of the U.K.-based publishing asset. Beyond this, there were no other special items during the quarter, given that the vast majority of spin related impacts took place recently. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP financial results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Overall, the solid performances by both the digital and media segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.37 per share for the quarter. Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 28%, driven by the acquisition and organic growth of Cars.com. Despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison faced by TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of 870 -- $807 million were up 19% year-over-year, driven by record digital segment revenues. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $591 million were up 19% over last year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com and, partially offset by lower corporate expenses. Corporate expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were $13 million, which includes the benefit of $2 million related to the elimination of depreciation, resulting from the sale of our MacLean Virginia headquarters. It is worth noting that the following sale, we are now leasing back-office space rent-free for 18 months. We are not paying any rent over this period, but we will record noncash rent expense as required by GAAP, which will add $2.5 million to corporate expenses per quarter. 
As previously discussed, we expect annual corporate expense will initially be around $70 million, decreasing to between $55 million and $60 million by the middle of 2016, which includes $7 million to $9 million of noncash, stock-based compensation expense. These reductions reflect the benefit of resizing the company's footprint, additional efficiencies achieved and elimination of any remaining spin related disynergies. Reflecting this glide path that we are already on, total company operating expenses for the quarter were 2% lower than the third quarter last year on a pro forma basis. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of both the Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues declined by 2% year-over-year due to the anticipated absence of political advertising revenues, partially offset by strong retransmission revenues and continued growth in digital advertising revenues as well as higher core advertising. Excluding the political revenue variances year-over-year, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 6% during the quarter. Retransmission fees of $109 million continues to grow double-digit as a result of a few small agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as increases within the existing agreements. 
These helped offset normal seasonal dislocation impacts, consistent with trends we've experienced in previous years to retransmission revenues in some markets resulting from Snowbird migrations. Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising, revenues were also up 13%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across our original television stations as well as those acquired through the below and London transaction. 
Core advertising results are also up, just over 1%. Our strongest revenue categories for the third quarter included professional services, entertainment, medical services and education. Looking ahead, to the fourth quarter due to an even more challenging year-over-year comparisons, including a record $92 million of political advertising revenues during the same quarter last year, Media segment revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to be lower in the mid- to high single digits based on the current fiscal year. It is also worth noting here, the impact of a calendar change we'll be making at the end of this year. Beginning with 2016, we'll be moving to a calendar year rather than the fiscal year we're currently on. In order to effectuate this we, need to extend the third quarter by 4 days December 31, 2015. As a result, our 4Q results particularly related to TEGNA Media will be impacted by the extra days. 
To help calibrate this, when we report fourth quarter numbers, we will provide you with the impact of those 4 days and its impact on the revenue and bottom-line results. During the third quarter, the media segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to network fees and investments, and our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings. During the quarter, digital segment revenue increased by 72% year-over-year or up 5% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economics in Cars.com, which increased by 26%. 
As Matt mentioned, excluding foreign exchange impact and the intentionally significant lower volume of lower-margin transactional products related to the impact, CareerBuilder revenues would've been up by about 2% year-over-year. Keep in mind that the product mix shift that Matt mentioned, also reflects the change of revenue recognition timing. As you'd expect, this will impact revenue trends, given the GAAP requirements to amortize revenue over the term of the sales contracts, which is typically in the 2 to 3-year range. 
As a result, CareerBuilder revenues declined by low single digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis during the quarter. Cars.com direct sales revenue, which represents over 70% of Cars.com channel revenues increased 12%, reflecting an increase in revenue per dealer, driven by new product sales and add-on prescription-based revenue. As a subset of this, national advertising increased by 14%, mainly due to increased display ad sales. Affiliate revenue, which represents less than 25% of total revenue increased 53%, driven by higher wholesale rates, that cars.com charges its affiliates. 
Keep in mind that a year ago, during the fourth, there was an accelerated adjustment to affiliate pricing, which normally occurs on a January 1 cycle as it will in 2016. Digital Segment operating expenses were 1% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, mainly reflecting lower lead acquisition costs and reduced revenue share page affiliate margin at Cars.com, resulting from the acquisition. As a result, total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $267 million increased by 22% over last year with Digital Segment doubling its adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we invested about $20 million in capital projects, primarily related to digital development as well as product integration and enhancements across the company. All of that, over $5 million were invested in real estate efficiencies and automation initiatives. We project CapEx spend of about $50 million for fourth quarter including onetime build out impacts to the relocation of the Seattle television station to more appropriately sized space. 
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations and borrowing under the new $200 million term loan were used to pay off maturing senior notes of $260 million. Bond accelerated share repurchases of $125 million at an average price of $25.75, interest payments of $48 million and to make investments and business initiatives of $20 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.47 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $118 million. In addition, as you saw in our release earlier this morning, we are very pleased that the tax efficient $270 million sale of our headquarters building closed earlier this month, which allows us to strengthen our share repurchases program by $75 million to $825 million over 3 years with the remainder of the sale proceeds to be used for debt retirement. 
As we announced this morning in our press release, we plan to redeem $180 million of our 7 1/8 [ph] 2018 senior notes this quarter, at a premium of 101.8% or $4 million and an associated impact in the quarter of a little over $0.02 a share, which will be treated as a special item. This MPD positive transaction will generate annualized interest cost savings of $14 million.

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are report",721,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. 
TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are reporting results as our stand-alone media and digital company. We are very excited about this milestone and about the terrific progress we've made in just the last 90 days or so since the close. So let's jump right into the morning's agenda. 
As you saw in our press release this morning, companywide revenue grew to $807 million, reflecting an increase in -- of almost 19% over last year. This is the result of a record revenue growth at TEGNA Digital and a solid performance at TEGNA Media despite the challenge of overcoming $40 million in political advertising in the third quarter last year. 
Expenses were higher, as you saw, when including the Cars.com acquisition but, on a pro forma basis, were down almost 2%. As you can see, even as our operations scale up, we continue to be very disciplined in ensuring that we are operating as efficiently as possible. 
As you also saw this morning, earnings were $0.39 on a GAAP basis, including $0.02 related to a special tax benefit, and were $0.37 per share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding net benefit. This compares to $0.29 during the same period last year, reflecting an improvement of approximately 28%. 
We also continue to generate considerable cash from our operations. Free cash flow totaled $164 million. This has translated into a substantial direct return to our shareholders as we have paid dividends totaling $76 million and repurchased approximately 5 million shares since our separation on June 29. 
Let's focus for a moment on capital allocation. Hopefully, you saw our second press release this morning. With the close on the sale of our headquarters building here in McLean, the board approved a $75 million increase to our $750 million share repurchase authorization, to be used over the original 3-year period. We will use the balance of the net proceeds to reduce debt, which Victoria will share with you in a few moments. 
As a reminder, we sold the building for $270 million, we'll have a gain of approximately $80 million to $90 million in the fourth quarter, and we'll pay a de minimis portion of that amount in taxes. We should also remind you that we sold a parcel of land here several years ago for $50 million. 
Moving to our business segments. TEGNA Media achieved revenues at the favorable end of our previous guidance, driven by core advertising revenue growth and double-digit revenue growth in retransmission and digital revenues. Overall, revenues were down slightly compared to a record third quarter last year that benefited from the aforementioned significant political revenue. 
While there obviously wasn't enough political ad spend this quarter to beat a tough 2014 comparison, TEGNA is very well positioned in key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward. We expect to see some political advertising in the fourth quarter this year, but we, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016. 
As again, you saw our retransmission revenue was up significantly, as I noted, over last year's third quarter. Other than normal seasonality, our subscriber numbers have been steady, and we remain confident in our previous guidance on retrans revenue. In fact, earlier this month, we reached a multiyear agreement with DISH Network for their continued carriage of TEGNA stations. 
On a related note, we were pleased to announce this summer the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. As a reminder, we are the #1 CBS affiliate group. As part of the renewal, we signed TEGNA up to participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. Partnering with CBS on both of these fronts is just one way to ensure that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices. 
One important note, the outcome of both the CBS affiliation agreement and the DISH negotiations are consistent with the long-term projections we provided at our Investor Day in June. 
Now let me ask David Lougee to share some of what we have been working on in TEGNA Media. Dave?"

At TEGNA Media, our strong performance and successful negotiations are driven by our relentless loyalty to our audiences and advertisers. And increasingly, we're using consumer data tools to drive editorial, marketing, content and ad sales decisions. With a wide-reaching set of consumer analytics that we use both at the corporate and local levels, we're creating deeper, more meaningful connections with all of our stakeholders, viewers, users, followers and clients. 
Don't forget that works from a mobile perspective. Last year, we released strong apps into the marketplace but with an intense metrics-based focus on downloads, app store ratings, page views, video views and more. We went back to the drawing board and have started moving our apps onto a new and highly improved mobile platform. We've already migrated about half our stations to this new platform, and the results have been spectacular. In the first few weeks post-migration, 9 of our top 10 stations were rated above 4 stars in the iOS App Store, and the average star rating for our apps jumped to 4.2. And this is just the beginning. 
From a content perspective, our teams are now making editorial decisions using technology to interact with consumers in real time. Through new social listening tools and digital dashboards right on the desks of our content producers, we're producing content and shows that integrate audience feedback and rely more heavily than ever on user-generated content. Tools like CrowdTangle, Tagboard and others are improving our products across every platform. This approach has helped us realize consumer growth on every screen. 
Our social following is up over 11 million consumers, plus 72%. Our mobile page views are up nearly 70% year-to-date. Between the Olympics, the presidential election and other key programming, we see plenty more opportunities for digital growth throughout 2016. 
So when you have the content audiences want distributed on all the platforms and devices they use, advertisers will come calling, which is why we've also made great strides in bolstering and streamlining our sales and marketing functions. 
With the new business analytics team in place along a new centralized sales and marketing function, we can deliver insight-based client solutions at scale. These 2 teams are working hand in hand to deliver multi-platform solutions to clients across categories, across content and across our markets. Every solution we're sending the marketplace is now backed by a massive data machine that generates meaningful audience insights, and these insights local advertisers would not otherwise have access to, and our stations are empowering them now with creative solutions to turn those insights into dollars."

Growth was driven by the acquisition of Cars.com and the impressive organic growth within that business. 
In addition, CareerBuilder generated substantial revenue growth in its Software-as-a-Service products in the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, CareerBuilder is bringing to market the only global pre-hire Software-as-a-Service platform, combining CareerBuilder's world-class advertising products together with software and analytics to create an integrated, seamless and efficient process for recruiters. The company's Software-as-a-Service platform is an addition to the product line, not a departure from the core business. 
While advertising remains and will always be a significant portion of the CareerBuilder pre-hire platform, CareerBuilder made the strategic decision in 2015 to stop supporting certain low-margin advertising and services, customers with intermittent needs -- for customers with intermittent needs that do not have the same long-term profit margins as those organizations with more steady recruitment efforts. 
Our outlook on our Software-as-a-Service business remains very strong, and our current expectations remain in line with what we discussed at our Investor Day in June, specifically that we expect accelerated growth at CareerBuilder in 2016 and double-digit growth by the end of 2017.

Excited to be here today and talk about CareerBuilder building the world's first and the world's only pre-hire platform. This pre-hire platform starts with advertising and includes many software services like career sites, candidate relationship management, job distribution, workforce analytics, applicant tracking systems and semantic search. No one else has this portfolio of software solutions. 
We have seen significant growth in our software in 2015, and we believe that will continue in 2016. Overall in 2015, we'll be slightly more than $700 million in revenue, and we believe we are set up to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% in 2016 versus 2015. In 2015, we are estimating that CareerBuilder revenue will be basically flat versus 2014 when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Moreover, we knew this -- we knew our growth this year would slow as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions. For example, we will be down almost $17 million in revenue or about 2.5 percentage points of revenue growth in 2015 versus 2014 in our employer services category where we source and screen candidates for companies. 
We stopped selling our transactional Source and Screen business in January and have focused on platform Source and Screen business only. We exited the transactional Source and Screen business because it was low-margin and hard to scale. Instead, we have focused in 2015 on platform Source and Screen business where the customer commits to a longer period of time and we can build software into the solution. 
This platform Source and Screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months, and we have a very strong pipeline of new platform Source and Screen business. We believe this business will grow around $7 million in 2016, a percentage point or so of growth in 2016. Therefore, just looking at our employer services business, we believe we will see a 3 percentage point improvement in revenue run rate in 2016 versus 2015, going from $17 million revenue decline to a $7 million revenue growth. 
We were also hurt in 2015 by moving some low-margin transactional job advertising business. We moved several thousand transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force in the spring to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. These accounts were declining and not getting much attention in the field sales force. 
The move itself was disruptive to all the customers, and some of the business was also not a fit for us going forward. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining. However, the move and these accounts are still weighing on 2015 results. 
If you look at our business, taking out the currency impact, removing Source and Screen revenue and removing the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to the specialized group, our business is actually up approximately 2% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2014. 
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we have included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunity to still go after more job volume although we acknowledge that the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled categories of jobs. 
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions, our resume database in 2015. We expect our software resume database solutions to grow in 2015 and 2016, with a more seasoned sales force selling the software and the significant enhancements we continue to make to our software and our resume database. 
Today, CareerBuilder officially launched a new candidate sourcing solution, the first and only tool that enables HR leaders to search resumes across all internal and external candidate databases and professional network sites in a single interface. It's a huge plus for increasing recruiter efficiency. CareerBuilder add semantic search, skills enhancement, skills extraction, classification. No other system does this today, so we're very excited about how this can change the recruiter experience for the better and reinforce CareerBuilder's place as the innovative leader of the pack. This solution is part of the broader software suite that CareerBuilder has developed that is unparalleled. 
There is no doubt 2015 has been a transition year for our business as we move significantly to improved portfolio of software and other platform solutions. We believe we are through most of that transition and are set up for growth again in 2016. We are excited about the opportunities for growth in the pre-hire platform, bringing solutions to customers that no one else has. We believe that this will lead to 5% to 7% growth in 2016 and move towards 10% growth by the end of 2017."

Turning to the other main pillar of TEGNA Digital, Cars.com. Total revenues for the third quarter were substantially higher compared to last year's same quarter. Revenue growth across all sales channels contributed to the increase.

Just 2 of the innovative products that we rolled out in 2015 include RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, which are performing even better than we had projected. RepairPal Certified is driving Cars.com's entrance into the service category while Event Positions is a new ad unit with an emphasis on mobile that provides dealer customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. Total expenses for Cars.com were down, and profitability was up sharply as a result. 
Even as we introduce new products and services, we continue to operate as efficiently as possible, and it's showing on our bottom line. The game plan at Cars.com right now is to keep innovating, whether it's introducing new products to our customers, finding creative ways to access new markets or building out our platform and capabilities in mobile or changing the way we operate and manage the business. Everything is about adapting to and staying ahead of an evolving digital environment. 
For instance, Cars.com has been replatforming its website to provide consumers with a responsively designed, consistent and tailored experience across all devices. 
In fact, we've seen a considerable rise in mobile traffic, which led to a recent comScore report that ranked Cars.com #1 mobile app, first in the third-party automotive resources category, both for a number of unique visitors and engagement, which is measured by the average length of time visitors spend on our app. The heavier traffic on the app, as was the recently redesigned mobile website, contributed to an overall increase in impressions delivered, which bolsters our national ad revenue. 
During the quarter, Cars.com launched a pioneering report for our dealer customers that enables them to view the total number of unique visitors to the Cars.com mobile platform within close proximity of their dealerships. This report, which we're calling lot insights, is the first of the kind -- of its kind in our industry to use geosensing technology to quantify the influence Cars.com has on walk-in customers, connecting the online shopping to the in-store experience, a metric that moves us beyond basic forms of lead measurement and positions us for future growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our third quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political spending that benefited us during the third quarter of 2014. 
However, we're proud of our financial and operational performance this quarter, our very first as a separate company. The strength of our underlying business drivers demonstrated during the quarter gives us great confidence in the future and are solidly consistent with the same trajectory and financial projections we provided to you in June during Investor Day. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight just one special item, reflecting a spin-related tax benefit of $6 million with an EPS impact of about $0.02 per share. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 33.8% was fairly consistent with the mid-30s range previously projected, driven higher than last year and on an ongoing basis by the absence of the lower tax rate on U.K. earnings subsequent to the spin of the U.K.-based publishing assets. Beyond this, there were no other special items during the quarter given that the vast majority of spin-related impacts took place previously. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Overall, with solid performances by both the Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.37 per share for the quarter. 
Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 28%, driven by the acquisition and organic growth of Cars.com despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison faced by TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of 870 -- $807 million were up 19% year-over-year, driven by record Digital Segment revenues. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $591 million were up 19% over last year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com and partially offset by lower corporate expenses. 
Corporate expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were $13 million, which includes the benefit of $2 million related to the elimination of depreciation, resulting from the sale of our McLean, Virginia headquarters. It is worth noting that following this sale, we are now leasing back-office space rent-free for 18 months. We are not paying any rent over this period, but we will record noncash rent expense as required by GAAP, which will add $2.5 million to corporate expense per quarter. 
As previously discussed, we expect annual corporate expense will initially be around $70 million, decreasing to between $55 million and $60 million by the middle of 2016, which includes $7 million to $9 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense. These reductions reflect the benefit of resizing the company's footprint, additional efficiencies achieved and elimination of any remaining spin-related dissynergies. Reflecting this glide path that we are already on, total company operating expenses for the quarter were 2% lower than third quarter last year on a pro forma basis. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of both the Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues declined by 2% year-over-year due to the anticipated absence of political advertising revenues, partially offset by strong retransmission revenues and continued growth in digital advertising revenues as well as higher core advertising. 
Excluding the political revenue variances year-over-year, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 6% during the quarter. Retransmission fees of $109 million continue to grow double-digit as a result of a few small agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as increases within the existing agreements. 
These helped to offset normal seasonal dislocation impacts, consistent with trends we've experienced in previous years, to retransmission revenues in some markets resulting from snowbird migrations. Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 13%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our original television stations as well as those acquired through the Belo and London transaction. Core advertising was also up, just over 1%. Our strongest revenue categories for the third quarter included professional services, entertainment, medical services and education. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, due to even more challenging year-over-year comparisons, including a record $92 million of political advertising revenues during the same quarter last year, Media Segment revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to be lower in the mid- to high single digits based on the current fiscal year. 
It is also worth noting here the impact of a calendar change we'll be making at the end of this year. Beginning with 2016, we'll be moving to a calendar year rather than the fiscal year we're currently on. In order to effectuate this, we need to extend the fourth quarter by 4 days to December 31, 2015. 
As a result, our fourth quarter results particularly related to TEGNA Media will be impacted by the extra days. To help calibrate this, when we report fourth quarter numbers, we will provide you with the impact of those 4 days and its impact on the revenue and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to network fees and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings. During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue increased by 72% year-over-year or up 5% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economics in Cars.com, which increased by 26%. 
As Matt mentioned, excluding foreign exchange impact and the intentionally significant lower volume of lower-margin transactional products-related impacts, CareerBuilder revenues would have been up by about 2% year-over-year. Keep in mind that the product mix shift that Matt mentioned also reflects the change in revenue recognition timing. As you'd expect, this will impact revenue trends given the GAAP requirement to amortize revenue over the term of the SaaS contracts, which is typically in the 2- to 3-year range. As a result, CareerBuilder revenues declined by low single digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis during the quarter. 
Cars.com direct sales revenue, which represents over 70% of Cars.com channel revenues, increased 12%, reflecting an increase in revenue per dealer, driven by new product sales and add-on subscription-based services. As a subset of this, national advertising increased by 14% mainly due to increased display ad sales. Affiliate revenue, which represents less than 25% of total revenue, increased 53%, driven by higher wholesale rates that Cars.com charges its affiliates. 
Keep in mind that a year ago, during the fourth quarter, there was an accelerated adjustment to affiliate pricing, which normally occurs on a January 1 cycle, as it will in 2016. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were 1% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, mainly reflecting lower lead acquisition costs and reduced revenue share paid to affiliate market at Cars.com, resulting from the acquisition. 
As a result, total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $267 million increased by 22% over last year, with Digital Segment doubling its adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we invested about $20 million in capital projects, primarily related to digital development as well as product integration and enhancements across the company. Of that, over $5 million was invested in real estate efficiencies and automation initiatives. 
We project CapEx spend of about $50 million for fourth quarter, including onetime buildout impacts of the relocation of our Seattle television station to more appropriately spaced -- sized space. 
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations and borrowing under the new $200 million term loan were used to pay off maturing senior notes of $260 million, bond accelerated share repurchases of $125 million at an average price of $25.75, interest payments of $48 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $20 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.47 billion, and cash on the balance sheet was $118 million. 
In addition, as you saw in our release earlier this morning, we are very pleased that the tax-efficient $270 million sale of our headquarters building closed earlier this month, which allows us to strengthen our share repurchase program by $75 million to $825 million over 3 years, with the remainder of the sale proceeds to be used for debt retirement. 
As we announced this morning in our press release, we plan to redeem $180 million of our 7 1/8% 2018 senior notes this quarter at a premium of 101.8% or $4 million and an associated impact to the quarter of a little over $0.02 a share, which will be treated as a special item. This NPV positive transaction will generate annualized interest cost savings of $14 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A"

Now there will be a slight 1-quarter differential because we will go to pricing -- normalized pricing increases, which we've always had. But those won't be in effect until January 1.

As you may recall, during Investor Day, we talked about a number of initiatives that we are putting into place, sales transformation, content transformation, a variety of different projects that obviously -- and new -- some new programming. So obviously, there has to be investments in those initiatives upfront. So when you start investing in Dallas, for instance, we're putting together -- we've put together a group in Dallas that are going to be overseeing our integrated marketing efforts and advertising efforts. We have to hire those people. We have to train those people. And now they are beginning to ramp up. So you're always going to have that initial investment that is going to precede the revenue being generated by those initiatives. Similarly, as you know, we've had some programming that we've been doing, for instance, T.D. Jakes where we've done 4 tests, et cetera. There's clearly investment that we have to make in that programming before we're going to see any revenue opportunity down the road. But I think what you saw in Investor Day is that we'll make these -- those are all fully -- those investments were all fully baked into our numbers in '15 and '16, et cetera. And then what we expect to achieve will -- was also baked into those numbers. So I think you'll see a little bit of a ramp in investment, but then we feel very strongly and we're already beginning to see, I think, some, for lack of a better word, green shoots on, for instance, some of the projects in the integrated marketing, Dave, that you might want to comment on."

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are report",721,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. 
TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are reporting results as our stand-alone media and digital company. We are very excited about this milestone and about the terrific progress we've made in just the last 90 days or so since the close. So let's jump right into the morning's agenda. 
As you saw in our press release this morning, companywide revenue grew to $807 million, reflecting an increase in -- of almost 19% over last year. This is the result of a record revenue growth at TEGNA Digital and a solid performance at TEGNA Media despite the challenge of overcoming $40 million in political advertising in the third quarter last year. 
Expenses were higher, as you saw, when including the Cars.com acquisition but, on a pro forma basis, were down almost 2%. As you can see, even as our operations scale up, we continue to be very disciplined in ensuring that we are operating as efficiently as possible. 
As you also saw this morning, earnings were $0.39 on a GAAP basis, including $0.02 related to a special tax benefit, and were $0.37 per share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding that benefit. This compares to $0.29 during the same period last year, reflecting an improvement of approximately 28%. 
We also continue to generate considerable cash from our operations. Free cash flow totaled $164 million. This has translated into a substantial direct return to our shareholders as we have paid dividends totaling $76 million and repurchased approximately 5 million shares since our separation on June 29. 
Let's focus for a moment on capital allocation. Hopefully, you saw our second press release this morning. With the close on the sale of our headquarters building here in McLean, the board approved a $75 million increase to our $750 million share repurchase authorization, to be used over the original 3-year period. We will use the balance of the net proceeds to reduce debt, which Victoria will share with you in a few moments. 
As a reminder, we sold the building for $270 million, we'll have a gain of approximately $80 million to $90 million in the fourth quarter, and we'll pay a de minimis portion of that amount in taxes. We should also remind you that we sold a parcel of land here several years ago for $50 million. 
Moving to our business segments. TEGNA Media achieved revenues at the favorable end of our previous guidance, driven by core advertising revenue growth and double-digit revenue growth in retransmission and digital revenues. Overall, revenues were down slightly compared to a record third quarter last year that benefited from the aforementioned significant political revenue. 
While there obviously wasn't enough political ad spend this quarter to beat a tough 2014 comparison, TEGNA is very well positioned in key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward. We expect to see some political advertising in the fourth quarter this year, but we, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016. 
As again, you saw our retransmission revenue was up significantly, as I noted, over last year's third quarter. Other than normal seasonality, our subscriber numbers have been steady, and we remain confident in our previous guidance on retrans revenue. In fact, earlier this month, we reached a multiyear agreement with DISH Network for their continued carriage of TEGNA stations. 
On a related note, we were pleased to announce this summer the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. As a reminder, we are the #1 CBS affiliate group. As part of the renewal, we signed TEGNA up to participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. Partnering with CBS on both of these fronts is just one way to ensure that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices. 
One important note, the outcome of both the CBS affiliation agreement and the DISH negotiations are consistent with the long-term projections we provided at our Investor Day in June. 
Now let me ask Dave Lougee to share some of what we have been working on in TEGNA Media. Dave?"

At TEGNA Media, our strong performance and successful negotiations are driven by our relentless loyalty to our audiences and advertisers. And increasingly, we're using consumer data tools to drive editorial, marketing, content and ad sales decisions. With a wide-reaching set of consumer analytics that we use both at the corporate and local levels, we're creating deeper, more meaningful connections with all of our stakeholders, viewers, users, followers and clients. 
Now let's look at how that works from a mobile perspective. Last year, we released strong apps into the marketplace but with an intense metrics-based focus on downloads, app store ratings, page views, video views and more. We went back to the drawing board and have started moving our apps onto a new and highly improved mobile platform. We've already migrated about half our stations to this new platform, and the results have been spectacular. In the first few weeks post-migration, 9 of our top 10 stations were rated above 4 stars in the iOS App Store, and the average star rating for our apps jumped to 4.2. And this is just the beginning. 
From a content perspective, our teams are now making editorial decisions using technology to interact with consumers in real time. Through new social listening tools and digital dashboards right on the desks of our content producers, we're producing content and shows that integrate audience feedback and rely more heavily than ever on user-generated content. Tools like CrowdTangle, Tagboard and others are improving our products across every platform. This approach has helped us realize consumer growth on every screen. 
Our social following is up over 11 million consumers, plus 72%. Our mobile page views are up nearly 70% year-to-date. Between the Olympics, the presidential election and other key programming, we see plenty more opportunities for digital growth throughout 2016. 
So when you have the content audiences want distributed on all the platforms and devices they use, advertisers will come calling, which is why we've also made great strides in bolstering and streamlining our sales and marketing functions. 
With a new business analytics team in place along a new centralized sales and marketing function, we can deliver insight-based client solutions at scale. These 2 teams are working hand in hand to deliver multi-platform solutions to clients across categories, across content and across our markets. Every solution we're sending the marketplace is now backed by a massive data machine that generates meaningful audience insights, and these insights local advertisers would not otherwise have access to, and our stations are empowering them now with creative solutions to turn those insights into dollars."

Growth was driven by the acquisition of Cars.com and the impressive organic growth within that business. 
In addition, CareerBuilder generated substantial revenue growth in its Software-as-a-Service products in the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, CareerBuilder is bringing to market the only global pre-hire Software-as-a-Service platform, combining CareerBuilder's world-class advertising products together with software and analytics to create an integrated, seamless and efficient process for recruiters. The company's Software-as-a-Service platform is an addition to the product line, not a departure from the core business. 
While advertising remains and will always be a significant portion of the CareerBuilder pre-hire platform, CareerBuilder made the strategic decision in 2015 to stop supporting certain low-margin advertising and services, customers with intermittent needs -- for customers with intermittent needs that do not have the same long-term profit margins as those organizations with more steady recruitment efforts. 
Our outlook on our Software-as-a-Service business remains very strong, and our current expectations remain in line with what we discussed at our Investor Day in June, specifically that we expect accelerated growth at CareerBuilder in 2016 and double-digit growth by the end of 2017.

Overall in 2015, we'll be slightly more than $700 million in revenue, and we believe we are set up to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% in 2016 versus 2015. In 2015, we are estimating that CareerBuilder revenue will be basically flat versus 2014 when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Moreover, we knew this -- we knew our growth this year would slow as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions. For example, we will be down almost $17 million in revenue or about 2.5 percentage points of revenue growth in 2015 versus 2014 in our employer services category where we source and screen candidates for companies. 
We stopped selling our transactional Source and Screen business in January and have focused on platform Source and Screen business only. We exited the transactional Source and Screen business because it was low-margin and hard to scale. Instead, we have focused in 2015 on platform Source and Screen business where the customer commits to a longer period of time and we can build software into the solution. 
This platform Source and Screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months, and we have a very strong pipeline of new platform Source and Screen business. We believe this business will grow around $7 million in 2016, a percentage point or so of growth in 2016. Therefore, just looking at our employer services business, we believe we will see a 3 percentage point improvement in revenue run rate in 2016 versus 2015, going from $17 million revenue decline to a $7 million revenue growth. 
We were also hurt in 2015 by moving some low-margin transactional job advertising business. We moved several thousand transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force in the spring to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. These accounts were declining and not getting much attention in the field sales force. 
The move itself was disruptive to all the customers, and some of the business was also not a fit for us going forward. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining. However, the move and these accounts are still weighing on 2015 results. 
If you look at our business, taking out the currency impact, removing Source and Screen revenue and removing the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to the specialized group, our business is actually up approximately 2% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2014. 
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we have included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunity to still go after more job volume although we acknowledge that the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled categories of jobs. 
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions and our resume database in 2015. We expect our software and resume database solutions to grow in 2015 and 2016, with a more seasoned sales force selling the software and the significant enhancements we continue to make to our software and our resume database. 
Today, CareerBuilder officially launched a new candidate sourcing solution, the first and only tool that enables HR leaders to search resumes across all internal and external candidate databases and professional network sites in a single interface. This is a huge plus for increasing recruiter efficiency. CareerBuilder adds semantic search, skills enhancement, skills extraction, classification. No other system does this today, so we're very excited about how this can change the recruiter experience for the better and reinforce CareerBuilder's place as the innovative leader of the pack. This solution is part of the broader software suite that CareerBuilder has developed that is unparalleled. 
There is no doubt 2015 has been a transition year for our business as we move significantly to improved portfolio of software and other platform solutions. We believe we are through most of that transition and are set up for growth again in 2016. We are excited about the opportunities for growth in the pre-hire platform, bringing solutions to customers that no one else has. We believe that this will lead to 5% to 7% growth in 2016 and move towards 10% growth by the end of 2017."

Turning to the other main pillar of TEGNA Digital, Cars.com. Total revenues for the third quarter were substantially higher compared to last year's same quarter. Revenue growth across all sales channels contributed to the increase.

Just 2 of the innovative products that we rolled out in 2015 include RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, which are performing even better than we had projected. RepairPal Certified is driving Cars.com's entrance into the service category while Event Positions is a new ad unit with an emphasis on mobile that provides dealer customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. Total expenses for Cars.com were down, and profitability was up sharply as a result. 
Even as we introduce new products and services, we continue to operate as efficiently as possible, and it's showing on our bottom line. The game plan at Cars.com right now is to keep innovating, whether it's introducing new products to our customers, finding creative ways to access new markets or building out our platform and capabilities in mobile or changing the way we operate and manage the business. Everything is about adapting to and staying ahead of an evolving digital environment. 
For instance, Cars.com has been replatforming its website to provide consumers with a responsively designed, consistent and tailored experience across all devices. 
In fact, we've seen a considerable rise in mobile traffic, which led to a recent comScore report that ranked Cars.com #1 mobile app, first in the third-party automotive resources category, both for the number of unique visitors and engagement, which is measured by the average length of time visitors spend on our app. The heavier traffic on the app, as well as the recently redesigned mobile website, contributed to an overall increase in impressions delivered, which bolsters our national ad revenue. 
During the quarter, Cars.com launched a pioneering report for our dealer customers that enables them to view the total number of unique visitors to the Cars.com mobile platform within close proximity of their dealerships. This report, which we're calling lot insights, is the first of the kind -- of its kind in our industry to use geosensing technology to quantify the influence Cars.com has on walk-in customers, connecting the online shopping to the in-store experience, a metric that moves us beyond basic forms of lead measurement and positions us for future growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our third quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political spending that benefited us during the third quarter of 2014. 
However, we're proud of our financial and operational performance this quarter, our very first as a separate company. The strength of our underlying business drivers demonstrated during the quarter gives us great confidence in the future and are solidly consistent with the same trajectory and financial projections we provided to you in June during Investor Day. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight just one special item, reflecting a spin-related tax benefit of $6 million with an EPS impact of about $0.02 per share. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 33.8% was fairly consistent with the mid-30s range previously projected, driven higher than last year and on an ongoing basis by the absence of the lower tax rate on U.K. earnings subsequent to the spin of the U.K.-based publishing assets. Beyond this, there were no other special items during the quarter given that the vast majority of spin-related impacts took place previously. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Overall, with solid performances by both the Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.37 per share for the quarter. 
Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 28%, driven by the acquisition and organic growth of Cars.com despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison faced by TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of 870 -- $807 million were up 19% year-over-year, driven by record Digital Segment revenues. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $591 million were up 19% over last year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com and partially offset by lower corporate expenses. 
Corporate expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were $13 million, which includes the benefit of $2 million related to the elimination of depreciation, resulting from the sale of our McLean, Virginia headquarters. It is worth noting that following this sale, we are now leasing back-office space rent-free for 18 months. We are not paying any rent over this period, but we will record noncash rent expense as required by GAAP, which will add $2.5 million to corporate expense per quarter. 
As previously discussed, we expect annual corporate expense will initially be around $70 million, decreasing to between $55 million and $60 million by the middle of 2016, which includes $7 million to $9 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense. These reductions reflect the benefit of resizing the company's footprint, additional efficiencies achieved and elimination of any remaining spin-related dissynergies. Reflecting this glide path that we are already on, total company operating expenses for the quarter were 2% lower than third quarter last year on a pro forma basis. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of both the Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues declined by 2% year-over-year due to the anticipated absence of political advertising revenues, partially offset by strong retransmission revenues and continued growth in digital advertising revenues as well as higher core advertising. 
Excluding the political revenue variances year-over-year, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 6% during the quarter. Retransmission fees of $109 million continue to grow double-digit as a result of a few small agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as increases within the existing agreements. 
These helped to offset normal seasonal dislocation impacts, consistent with trends we've experienced in previous years, to retransmission revenues in some markets resulting from snowbird migrations. Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 13%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our original television stations as well as those acquired through the Belo and London transactions. Core advertising was also up, just over 1%. Our strongest revenue categories for the third quarter included professional services, entertainment, medical services and education. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, due to even more challenging year-over-year comparisons, including a record $92 million of political advertising revenues during the same quarter last year, Media Segment revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to be lower in the mid- to high single digits based on the current fiscal year. 
It is also worth noting here the impact of a calendar change we'll be making at the end of this year. Beginning with 2016, we'll be moving to a calendar year rather than the fiscal year we're currently on. In order to effectuate this, we need to extend the fourth quarter by 4 days to December 31, 2015. 
As a result, our fourth quarter results particularly related to TEGNA Media will be impacted by the extra days. To help calibrate this, when we report fourth quarter numbers, we will provide you with the impact of those 4 days and its impact on the revenue and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to network fees and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings. During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue increased by 72% year-over-year or up 5% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economics in Cars.com, which increased by 26%. 
As Matt mentioned, excluding foreign exchange impact and the intentionally significant lower volume of lower-margin transactional products-related impacts, CareerBuilder revenues would have been up by about 2% year-over-year. Keep in mind that the product mix shift that Matt mentioned also reflects the change in revenue recognition timing. As you'd expect, this will impact revenue trends given the GAAP requirement to amortize revenue over the term of the SaaS contracts, which is typically in the 2- to 3-year range. As a result, CareerBuilder revenues declined by low single digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis during the quarter. 
Cars.com direct sales revenue, which represents over 70% of Cars.com channel revenues, increased 12%, reflecting an increase in revenue per dealer, driven by new product sales and add-on subscription-based services. As a subset of this, national advertising increased by 14% mainly due to increased display ad sales. Affiliate revenue, which represents less than 25% of total revenue, increased 53%, driven by higher wholesale rates that Cars.com charges its affiliates. 
Keep in mind that a year ago, during the fourth quarter, there was an accelerated adjustment to affiliate pricing, which normally occurs on a January 1 cycle, as it will in 2016. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were 1% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, mainly reflecting lower lead acquisition costs and reduced revenue share paid to affiliate markets at Cars.com, resulting from the acquisition. 
As a result, total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $267 million increased by 22% over last year, with the Digital Segment doubling its adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we invested about $20 million in capital projects, primarily related to digital development as well as product integration and enhancements across the company. Of that, over $5 million was invested in real estate efficiencies and automation initiatives. 
We project CapEx spend of about $50 million for fourth quarter, including onetime buildout impacts for the relocation of our Seattle television station to more appropriately spaced -- sized space. 
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations and borrowing under the new $200 million term loan were used to pay off maturing senior notes of $260 million, fund accelerated share repurchases of $125 million at an average price of $25.75, interest payments of $48 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $20 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.47 billion, and cash on the balance sheet was $118 million. 
In addition, as you saw in our release earlier this morning, we are very pleased that the tax-efficient $270 million sale of our headquarters building closed earlier this month, which allows us to strengthen our share repurchase program by $75 million to $825 million over 3 years, with the remainder of the sale proceeds to be used for debt retirement. 
As we announced this morning in our press release, we plan to redeem $180 million of our 7 1/8% 2018 senior notes this quarter at a premium of 101.8% or $4 million and an associated impact to the quarter of a little over $0.02 a share, which will be treated as a special item. This NPV positive transaction will generate annualized interest cost savings of $14 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A"

As you may recall, during Investor Day, we talked about a number of initiatives that we are putting into place, sales transformation, content transformation, a variety of different projects that obviously -- and new -- some new programming. So obviously, there has to be investment in those initiatives upfront. So when you start investing in dollars [ph], for instance, we're putting together -- we've put together a group in Dallas that are going to be overseeing our integrated marketing efforts and advertising efforts. We had to hire those people. We had to train those people. And now they are beginning to ramp up. So you're always going to have that initial investment that is going to precede the revenue being generated by those initiatives. Similarly, as you know, we've had some programming that we've been doing, for instance, T.D. Jakes where we've done 4 tests, et cetera. There's clearly investment that we have to make in that programming before we're going to see any revenue opportunity down the road. But I think what you saw in Investor Day is that we'll make these -- those were all fully -- those investments were all fully baked into our numbers in '15 and '16, et cetera. And then what we expect to achieve will -- was also baked into those numbers. So I think you'll see a little bit of a ramp in investment, but then we feel very strongly and we're already beginning to see, I think, some, for lack of a better word, green shoots on, for instance, some of the projects in the integrated marketing, Dave, that you might want to comment on."

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are report",721,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to TEGNA's third quarter earnings call. 
TEGNA started trading as a separate company at the start of our third quarter on June 29. So today marks the first time we are reporting results as our stand-alone media and digital company. We are very excited about this milestone and about the terrific progress we've made in just the last 90 days or so since the close. So let's jump right into the morning's agenda. 
As you saw in our press release this morning, companywide revenue grew to $807 million, reflecting an increase in -- of almost 19% over last year. This is the result of a record revenue growth at TEGNA Digital and a solid performance at TEGNA Media despite the challenge of overcoming $40 million in political advertising in the third quarter last year. 
Expenses were higher, as you saw, when including the Cars.com acquisition but, on a pro forma basis, were down almost 2%. As you can see, even as our operations scale up, we continue to be very disciplined in ensuring that we are operating as efficiently as possible. 
As you also saw this morning, earnings were $0.39 on a GAAP basis, including $0.02 related to a special tax benefit, and were $0.37 per share on a non-GAAP basis, excluding that benefit. This compares to $0.29 during the same period last year, reflecting an improvement of approximately 28%. 
We also continue to generate considerable cash from our operations. Free cash flow totaled $164 million. This has translated into a substantial direct return to our shareholders as we have paid dividends totaling $76 million and repurchased approximately 5 million shares since our separation on June 29. 
Let's focus for a moment on capital allocation. Hopefully, you saw our second press release this morning. With the close on the sale of our headquarters building here in McLean, the board approved a $75 million increase to our $750 million share repurchase authorization, to be used over the original 3-year period. We will use the balance of the net proceeds to reduce debt, which Victoria will share with you in a few moments. 
As a reminder, we sold the building for $270 million, we'll have a gain of approximately $80 million to $90 million in the fourth quarter, and we'll pay a de minimis portion of that amount in taxes. We should also remind you that we sold a parcel of land here several years ago for $50 million. 
Moving to our business segments. TEGNA Media achieved revenues at the favorable end of our previous guidance, driven by core advertising revenue growth and double-digit revenue growth in retransmission and digital revenues. Overall, revenues were down slightly compared to a record third quarter last year that benefited from the aforementioned significant political revenue. 
While there obviously wasn't enough political ad spend this quarter to beat a tough 2014 comparison, TEGNA is very well positioned in key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward. We expect to see some political advertising in the fourth quarter this year, but we, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016. 
As again, you saw our retransmission revenue was up significantly, as I noted, over last year's third quarter. Other than normal seasonality, our subscriber numbers have been steady, and we remain confident in our previous guidance on retrans revenue. In fact, earlier this month, we reached a multiyear agreement with DISH Network for their continued carriage of TEGNA stations. 
On a related note, we were pleased to announce this summer the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. As a reminder, we are the #1 CBS affiliate group. As part of the renewal, we signed TEGNA up to participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. Partnering with CBS on both of these fronts is just one way to ensure that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices. 
One important note, the outcome of both the CBS affiliation agreement and the DISH negotiations are consistent with the long-term projections we provided at our Investor Day in June. 
Now let me ask Dave Lougee to share some of what we have been working on in TEGNA Media. Dave?"

At TEGNA Media, our strong performance and successful negotiations are driven by our relentless loyalty to our audiences and advertisers.

At TEGNA Media, our strong performance and successful negotiations are driven by our relentless loyalty to our audiences and advertisers. And increasingly, we're using consumer data tools to drive editorial, marketing, content and ad sales decisions. With a wide-reaching set of consumer analytics that we use both at the corporate and local levels, we're creating deeper, more meaningful connections with all of our stakeholders, viewers, users, followers and clients. 
Now let's look at how that works from a mobile perspective. Last year, we released strong apps into the marketplace but with an intense metrics-based focus on downloads, app store ratings, page views, video views and more. We went back to the drawing board and have started moving our apps onto a new and highly improved mobile platform. We've already migrated about half our stations to this new platform, and the results have been spectacular. In the first few weeks post-migration, 9 of our top 10 stations were rated above 4 stars in the iOS App Store, and the average star rating for our apps jumped to 4.2. And this is just the beginning. 
From a content perspective, our teams are now making editorial decisions using technology to interact with consumers in real time. Through new social listening tools and digital dashboards right on the desks of our content producers, we're producing content and shows that integrate audience feedback and rely more heavily than ever on user-generated content. Tools like CrowdTangle, Tagboard and others are improving our products across every platform. This approach has helped us realize consumer growth on every screen. 
Our social following is up over 11 million consumers, plus 72%. Our mobile page views are up nearly 70% year-to-date. Between the Olympics, the presidential election and other key programming, we see plenty more opportunities for digital growth throughout 2016. 
So when you have the content audiences want distributed on all the platforms and devices they use, advertisers will come calling, which is why we've also made great strides in bolstering and streamlining our sales and marketing functions. 
With a new business analytics team in place along a new centralized sales and marketing function, we can deliver insight-based client solutions at scale. These 2 teams are working hand in hand to deliver multi-platform solutions to clients across categories, across content and across our markets. Every solution we're sending the marketplace is now backed by a massive data machine that generates meaningful audience insights, and these insights local advertisers would not otherwise have access to, and our stations are empowering them now with creative solutions to turn those insights into dollars."

While advertising remains and will always be a significant portion of the CareerBuilder pre-hire platform, CareerBuilder made the strategic decision in 2015 to stop supporting certain low-margin advertising and services, customers with intermittent needs -- for customers with intermittent needs that do not have the same long-term profit margins as those organizations with more steady recruitment efforts. 
Our outlook on our Software-as-a-Service business remains very strong, and our current expectations remain in line with what we discussed at our Investor Day in June, specifically that we expect accelerated growth at CareerBuilder in 2016 and double-digit growth by the end of 2017. 
Matt Ferguson, the longtime successful CEO of CareerBuilder, is here to discuss those opportunities. Matt?"

Excited to be here today and talk about CareerBuilder building the world's first and the world's only pre-hire platform. This pre-hire platform starts with advertising and includes many software services like career sites, candidate relationship management, job distribution, workforce analytics, applicant tracking systems and semantic search. No one else has this portfolio of software solutions. 
We have seen significant growth in our software in 2015, and we believe that will continue in 2016. Overall in 2015, we'll be slightly more than $700 million in revenue, and we believe we are set up to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% in 2016 versus 2015. In 2015, we are estimating that CareerBuilder revenue will be basically flat versus 2014 when you exclude the impact of currency. 
Moreover, we knew this -- we knew our growth this year would slow as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions. For example, we will be down almost $17 million in revenue or about 2.5 percentage points of revenue growth in 2015 versus 2014 in our employer services category where we source and screen candidates for companies. 
We stopped selling our transactional Source and Screen business in January and have focused on platform Source and Screen business only. We exited the transactional Source and Screen business because it was low-margin and hard to scale. Instead, we have focused in 2015 on platform Source and Screen business where the customer commits to a longer period of time and we can build software into the solution. 
This platform Source and Screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months, and we have a very strong pipeline of new platform Source and Screen business. We believe this business will grow around $7 million in 2016, a percentage point or so of growth in 2016. Therefore, just looking at our employer services business, we believe we will see a 3 percentage point improvement in revenue run rate in 2016 versus 2015, going from $17 million revenue decline to a $7 million revenue growth. 
We were also hurt in 2015 by moving some low-margin transactional job advertising business. We moved several thousand transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force in the spring to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. These accounts were declining and not getting much attention in the field sales force. 
The move itself was disruptive to all the customers, and some of the business was also not a fit for us going forward. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining. However, the move and these accounts are still weighing on 2015 results. 
If you look at our business, taking out the currency impact, removing Source and Screen revenue and removing the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to the specialized group, our business is actually up approximately 2% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2014. 
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we have included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunity to still go after more job volume although we acknowledge that the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled categories of jobs. 
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions and our resume database in 2015. We expect our software and resume database solutions to grow in 2015 and 2016, with a more seasoned sales force selling the software and the significant enhancements we continue to make to our software and our resume database. 
Today, CareerBuilder officially launched a new candidate sourcing solution, the first and only tool that enables HR leaders to search resumes across all internal and external candidate databases and professional network sites in a single interface. This is a huge plus for increasing recruiter efficiency. CareerBuilder adds semantic search, skills enhancement, skills extraction, classification. No other system does this today, so we're very excited about how this can change the recruiter experience for the better and reinforce CareerBuilder's place as the innovative leader of the pack. This solution is part of the broader software suite that CareerBuilder has developed that is unparalleled. 
There is no doubt 2015 has been a transition year for our business as we move significantly to improved portfolio of software and other platform solutions. We believe we are through most of that transition and are set up for growth again in 2016. We are excited about the opportunities for growth in the pre-hire platform, bringing solutions to customers that no one else has. We believe that this will lead to 5% to 7% growth in 2016 and move towards 10% growth by the end of 2017."

Turning to the other main pillar of TEGNA Digital, Cars.com. Total revenues for the third quarter were substantially higher compared to last year's same quarter. Revenue growth across all sales channels contributed to the increase. 
Now here's Alex Vetter to share an update on the recent product rollout at Cars.com."

Just 2 of the innovative products that we rolled out in 2015 include RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, which are performing even better than we had projected. RepairPal Certified is driving Cars.com's entrance into the service category while Event Positions is a new ad unit with an emphasis on mobile that provides dealer customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. Total expenses for Cars.com were down, and profitability was up sharply as a result. 
Even as we introduce new products and services, we continue to operate as efficiently as possible, and it's showing on our bottom line. The game plan at Cars.com right now is to keep innovating, whether it's introducing new products to our customers, finding creative ways to access new markets or building out our platform and capabilities in mobile or changing the way we operate and manage the business. Everything is about adapting to and staying ahead of an evolving digital environment. 
For instance, Cars.com has been replatforming its website to provide consumers with a responsively designed, consistent and tailored experience across all devices. 
In fact, we've seen a considerable rise in mobile traffic, which led to a recent comScore report that ranked Cars.com #1 mobile app, first in the third-party automotive resources category, both for the number of unique visitors and engagement, which is measured by the average length of time visitors spend on our app. The heavier traffic on the app, as well as the recently redesigned mobile website, contributed to an overall increase in impressions delivered, which bolsters our national ad revenue. 
During the quarter, Cars.com launched a pioneering report for our dealer customers that enables them to view the total number of unique visitors to the Cars.com mobile platform within close proximity of their dealerships. This report, which we're calling lot insights, is the first of the kind -- of its kind in our industry to use geosensing technology to quantify the influence Cars.com has on walk-in customers, connecting the online shopping to the in-store experience, a metric that moves us beyond basic forms of lead measurement and positions us for future growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our third quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political spending that benefited us during the third quarter of 2014. 
However, we're proud of our financial and operational performance this quarter, our very first as a separate company. The strength of our underlying business drivers demonstrated during the quarter gives us great confidence in the future and are solidly consistent with the same trajectory and financial projections we provided to you in June during Investor Day. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight just one special item, reflecting a spin-related tax benefit of $6 million with an EPS impact of about $0.02 per share. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 33.8% was fairly consistent with the mid-30s range previously projected, driven higher than last year and on an ongoing basis by the absence of the lower tax rate on U.K. earnings subsequent to the spin of the U.K.-based publishing assets. Beyond this, there were no other special items during the quarter given that the vast majority of spin-related impacts took place previously. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Overall, with solid performances by both the Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.37 per share for the quarter. 
Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 28%, driven by the acquisition and organic growth of Cars.com despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison faced by TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of 870 -- $807 million were up 19% year-over-year, driven by record Digital Segment revenues. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $591 million were up 19% over last year, reflecting the addition of Cars.com and partially offset by lower corporate expenses. 
Corporate expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were $13 million, which includes the benefit of $2 million related to the elimination of depreciation, resulting from the sale of our McLean, Virginia headquarters. It is worth noting that following this sale, we are now leasing back-office space rent-free for 18 months. We are not paying any rent over this period, but we will record noncash rent expense as required by GAAP, which will add $2.5 million to corporate expense per quarter. 
As previously discussed, we expect annual corporate expense will initially be around $70 million, decreasing to between $55 million and $60 million by the middle of 2016, which includes $7 million to $9 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense. These reductions reflect the benefit of resizing the company's footprint, additional efficiencies achieved and elimination of any remaining spin-related dissynergies. Reflecting this glide path that we are already on, total company operating expenses for the quarter were 2% lower than third quarter last year on a pro forma basis. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of both the Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues declined by 2% year-over-year due to the anticipated absence of political advertising revenues, partially offset by strong retransmission revenues and continued growth in digital advertising revenues as well as higher core advertising. 
Excluding the political revenue variances year-over-year, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 6% during the quarter. Retransmission fees of $109 million continue to grow double-digit as a result of a few small agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as increases within the existing agreements. 
These helped to offset normal seasonal dislocation impacts, consistent with trends we've experienced in previous years, to retransmission revenues in some markets resulting from snowbird migrations. Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 13%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our original television stations as well as those acquired through the Belo and London transactions. Core advertising was also up, just over 1%. Our strongest revenue categories for the third quarter included professional services, entertainment, medical services and education. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, due to even more challenging year-over-year comparisons, including a record $92 million of political advertising revenues during the same quarter last year, Media Segment revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to be lower in the mid- to high single digits based on the current fiscal year. 
It is also worth noting here the impact of a calendar change we'll be making at the end of this year. Beginning with 2016, we'll be moving to a calendar year rather than the fiscal year we're currently on. In order to effectuate this, we need to extend the fourth quarter by 4 days to December 31, 2015. 
As a result, our fourth quarter results particularly related to TEGNA Media will be impacted by the extra days. To help calibrate this, when we report fourth quarter numbers, we will provide you with the impact of those 4 days and its impact on the revenue and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs related to network fees and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings. During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue increased by 72% year-over-year or up 5% on a pro forma basis, driven by the strong organic growth and new affiliation agreement economics in Cars.com, which increased by 26%. 
As Matt mentioned, excluding foreign exchange impact and the intentionally significant lower volume of lower-margin transactional products-related impacts, CareerBuilder revenues would have been up by about 2% year-over-year. Keep in mind that the product mix shift that Matt mentioned also reflects the change in revenue recognition timing. As you'd expect, this will impact revenue trends given the GAAP requirement to amortize revenue over the term of the SaaS contracts, which is typically in the 2- to 3-year range. As a result, CareerBuilder revenues declined by low single digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis during the quarter. 
Cars.com direct sales revenue, which represents over 70% of Cars.com channel revenues, increased 12%, reflecting an increase in revenue per dealer, driven by new product sales and add-on subscription-based services. As a subset of this, national advertising increased by 14% mainly due to increased display ad sales. Affiliate revenue, which represents less than 25% of total revenue, increased 53%, driven by higher wholesale rates that Cars.com charges its affiliates. 
Keep in mind that a year ago, during the fourth quarter, there was an accelerated adjustment to affiliate pricing, which normally occurs on a January 1 cycle, as it will in 2016. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were 1% lower compared to last year on a pro forma basis, mainly reflecting lower lead acquisition costs and reduced revenue share paid to affiliate markets at Cars.com, resulting from the acquisition. 
As a result, total company adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $267 million increased by 22% over last year, with the Digital Segment doubling its adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we invested about $20 million in capital projects, primarily related to digital development as well as product integration and enhancements across the company. Of that, over $5 million was invested in real estate efficiencies and automation initiatives. 
We project CapEx spend of about $50 million for fourth quarter, including onetime buildout impacts for the relocation of our Seattle television station to more appropriately spaced -- sized space. 
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations and borrowing under the new $200 million term loan were used to pay off maturing senior notes of $260 million, fund accelerated share repurchases of $125 million at an average price of $25.75, interest payments of $48 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $20 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.47 billion, and cash on the balance sheet was $118 million. 
In addition, as you saw in our release earlier this morning, we are very pleased that the tax-efficient $270 million sale of our headquarters building closed earlier this month, which allows us to strengthen our share repurchase program by $75 million to $825 million over 3 years, with the remainder of the sale proceeds to be used for debt retirement. 
As we announced this morning in our press release, we plan to redeem $180 million of our 7 1/8% 2018 senior notes this quarter at a premium of 101.8% or $4 million and an associated impact to the quarter of a little over $0.02 a share, which will be treated as a special item. This NPV positive transaction will generate annualized interest cost savings of $14 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A"

So obviously, there has to be investment in those initiatives upfront. So when you start investing in dollars [ph], for instance, we're putting together -- we've put together a group in Dallas that are going to be overseeing our integrated marketing efforts and advertising efforts. We had to hire those people. We had to train those people. And now they are beginning to ramp up. So you're always going to have that initial investment that is going to precede the revenue being generated by those initiatives. Similarly, as you know, we've had some programming that we've been doing, for instance, T.D. Jakes where we've done 4 tests, et cetera. There's clearly investment that we have to make in that programming before we're going to see any revenue opportunity down the road.
