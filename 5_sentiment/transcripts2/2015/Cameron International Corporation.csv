Cameron reported fourth quarter earnings today of $1.34 per share for continued operations, excluding other costs, an increase of 33% versus year-ago quarter. The primary driver for these improved results was the operating performance of our Drilling and Surface segments along with a significant reductio n in the company's overhead expense. Most notably, our Drilling segment reported a 89% increase in operating income and an almost 700 basis point improvement in margin relative to the year-ago quarter.
While the Surface business reported a 23% increase in operating income, consolidated SG&A expense declined 11% relative to the year-ago quarter. On a consolidated basis, these factors contributed to an operating income margin of 15% for Cameron. 
Additionally, the company generated $938 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an increase of 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and reflected in part our sharpened focus on reducing working capital.
Overall, 2014 was a great year for Cameron on a number of fronts. Most impressive was the turnaround story with our Drilling Systems. As previously mentioned, we saw a 700 basis point improvement in margins versus year-ago levels. Even more importantly, we have now embedded both processes and work practices that have driven predictable success in executing our backlog.
We are also very pleased with the timing and the outcome of the divestiture process with compression. Not only did we generate $1.5 billion of sales proceeds, it also allowed us to sharpen our focus on Cameron's core oil and gas businesses.
We implemented a number of cost reduction programs that began the process to streamline our support structure across all of our business units, which proved to be meaningful contributor to improving overall margins. We returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014, while maintaining a very healthy balance sheet.
And the momentum we created with investing and broadening the platform of our core businesses will benefit us in a market where customers' attention turns cost and efficiency versus just availability.
Now some comments regarding outlook for 2015, and I will start with our own store markets. Fairly, we are witnessing a very sharp correction in activity that will negatively impact our Surface, Valves and Drilling segments in 2015. North America will be impacted much harder than international. The degree to which North America activity correct is still unknown. The range of possibilities will be heavily influenced by both the customer and the basin. Cameron has a broad presence in North America and we have a very broad customer base. Mostly populated without sees, major independents and the major drilling contractors, all of which we se as a positive to have in this environment.
Cameron also has a very large international onshore presence, which will contract, at a slower rate, and in some markets, could even expand. Cameron's customer base is made up mostly of large OCs and NOCs whose attitudes towards investing through cycles have proven to be more predictable. 
As for our offshore in deepwater markets, OneSubsea Drilling Systems and valve markets will all be exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing offshore as well.
We saw the pause about hit on most deepwater drilling capital spending last year and nothing in our views has changed with the exception the we are not seeing drilling contractors actually scrap older generation rigs, something we have rarely seen in prior year cycles, which in time is a positive for some form of newbuild recovery.
We will see some compression in the services part of our businesses due to lower reutilization and pricing, but we also see opportunity to serve a broader portfolio of products from our rig equipment acquisitions.
As for Subsea projects of every perspective project we are tracking has or is going through recalibration process for both scope and price. Some of this work actually started last year. While we fully expect to see projects award in 2015, the value or the result of these exercises maybe different front what we were thinking 6 [ph] months ago. 
The importance of Deepwater projects in our customers' portfolios have not changed. The timing on which 1 cycle to the forefront in the current cost environment will, which I'll place to the strength that OneSubsea was created to deliver.
Having said all of that, I'll remind you that Cameron has a substantial backlog of work. And that backlog provides us with good visibility and to a portion of our 2015 operating revenues and margins. And our confidence to deliver that backlog at the margins and in the time frame we have in our plan is very high, given the performance we've seen throughout 2014.
However, we will see our equally, if not more important, shorter cycle booked and built businesses meaningfully impacted by the current environment. And the speed in which we have seen the correction in this cycle over the past months has created significant uncertainty with the degree that this will impact both the revenues and margins of our short-cycle businesses, especially those in North America.
Given we're still very early in the cycle, it wd be challenging to predict the range of outcomes within our budget and, therefore, feel it's prudent not providing annual EPS guidance for 2015. Chuck will, however, provide detailed commentary on each of our operating segments.
While trying to speculate on the depth and duration of the cycle, our action will be difficult. Rest assured that Cameron will stay very close to our customers to ensure we are advancing and investing the most cost efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our call structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms. You can also expect us to leverage our broad product, customer and geographic diversity to expand share. Every operator is currently reviewing their supplier's performance to ensure that they have the most cost-effective partner in this environment and that will open doors for Cameron.
This competitive drive will help us weather this cycle as we have weathered previous cycles and emerge as even more formidable company over the longer term.
I will now turn over the discussion over to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

Before we I get into what we need to do in 2015, I'd like to reiterate what Jack said regarding our performance in 2014. We've ever had our safest year ever while providing products and services at a record level. We drove our cost structure down every quarter in 2014 while performing at this record activity rate. Focus on execution, cost reduction and servicing our customers results in strong margin progression throughout the year.
Fourth quarter results were a culmination of a lot of hard work and diligence that positions the enterprise in a better place to perform on the challenges that we face in 2015.
Now let's switch gears to the present in 2015. Weak macro environment, as Jack described, is certainly evident when you look at Cameron's orders in backlog position in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.7:1 as order intake declined in all of our businesses on a sequential quarter basis. There will, however, a couple of bright spots of customer activity during the fourth quarter. In particular, we booked a multiyear contract with ExxonMobil for topside wellhead equipment and production trees for the Hevron project, a 52-well development located offshore Newfoundland, as well as OneSubsea's execution of OneSubsea well intervention alliance with Helix and Schlumberger. Nevertheless, the order flow was weak and the net result of that was a decline in our backlog throughout the [ph] $9.5 billion at the end of the quarter.
Despite the reduction in backlog, the backlog itself is substantial, especially in our larger cycles businesses, OneSubsea and Drilling. The organization is highly focused on our ability to execute our backlog and the operational improvements realized in 2014 will carry over into 2015.
As Jack said, in this challenging macro environment, Cameron is absolutely focused on the things they can control. We are committed to our objective of delivering steady improvement in our consolidated operating margins on average over time. To be clear, over a multiyear period, some of this improvement could be temporarily masked by pricing pressure and reduced volumes, but we are confident in our ability to keep advancing this program over the long term and driving excellence in our ability to execute.
We are seeking to do this through continuous improvements in virtually every aspect of our operations from our supply chain to product delivery and throughout our corporate and support services organizations. We're finding ways to work smarter, faster and more efficiently and more creatively interesting we do. 
We also want to make sure that we're operating at maximum cost effectiveness. The cost reduction steps were taken in 2014 are helping us prepare for 2015. We will and have already taken further cost reductions in the first quarter and we will continue to aggressively drive our cost structure down throughout the year as we work off [indiscernible] backlog.
In addition to volume reduction, the other challenge we are facing is pricing. The majority of our customers are seeking or have already asked for price concessions to help them weather the current environment. And Cameron's response to this request has been a proactive and collaborative approach. We are working to the customers to drive improved technology and processes that will reduces their overall spending commitments in their operating costs. We feel that the largest cost savings for operators will come from a drive towards standardization, improved technology and further customer integration. We are in the early days but we are already seeing a few wins with this approach.
Each of our businesses have different drivers and behave differently throughout the down cycle. Having completed our divestiture program in 2014, we are committed to each of our 4 operating segments and I'm confident that we will emerge through this cycle better than ever.
OneSubsea will continue to build on the quarter [ph] process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments. We continue to progress in this endeavor and operators will need help to find a cost effective solutions to generate higher production from the Deepwater assets.
Or Surface division is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform in a relative basis and grow market share by providing the highest service level and the best reliability in the industry.
In Drilling, we will take this opportunity in the downturn to complete a comprehensive and integrated drilling offering. The Valves & Measurement segment touches everything we do in Cameron in every segment of our businesses. We will leverage the bright knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement outperforms in this business cycle.
While we're actively realistic facing the current market situation, Cameron's poised to take advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves. We're being very proactive in our approach to manage oru customers and their cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence.
The activities and programs that we're [indiscernible] now will position Cameron for long-term success and outperformance throughout the cycle. 
I'll now turn it over to Chuck for the financials."
19839,275962311,750845,"Cameron International Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts our models. Revenues for the quarter wer",1305,"Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts our models. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.8 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. Segment operating income margins were 15% for the quarter, flat sequentially but up 200 basis points from prior year level. Corporate expenses for the quarter were $35 million and EPS for the costs of $1.34, an all-time [indiscernible] of a record.
The key message in our fourth quarter financials is our operating margin improvement we've made throughout 2014. The improvements have come from better efficiency in our plans as well as tight control over our costs and these will serve us well during the downturn.
Subsea revenues increased 12% sequentially, whilst operating margin improved to 10%, reflecting the strength of our margin in backlog. We're pleased with the sequential progression to recognize the need to continue to grow were services offering in this segment to further enhance margins.
Our Surface revenues increased 10% sequentially and represented the highest revenue level in our history, driven primarily by North America. This operating margin improved 110 basis points sequentially, driven by the higher revenue level as well as improved mix in North America.
Drilling revenues increased 2% sequentially. To give you some perspective on the improvements Drilling has made over the last 12 months, the fourth quarter revenue is 20% higher than it was in the year-ago period. Operating margin for Drilling was 18.5%, which is below the previous quarter simply due to mix. The fourth quarter operating margin is 850 basis points higher than the low point we saw in Q1 of this year.
V&M revenues decreased 5% sequentially as it has struggled with orders and pricing in its engineered valve line all year. As a result, we were hit hard this quarter with absorption challenges and lower margin engineered valve shipments, which resulted in a decline in Q4 operating margin to 15.3%. We're in the midst of completing a realignment of this segment, which will allow us to capture additional market share while lowering our costs at the same time.
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $938 million, obviously a record level, as our working capital efficiency drive begins to show results. As a result, we ended the year with $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments. As we announced earlier in the month, we completed our sale of our Centrifugal Compression business and our net proceeds after taxes are estimated to be $600 million. As a result of the sale, we will recognize that estimated gain for financial segment purposes of approximately $400 [ph] million, which will be reflected in discontinued ops in Q1.
We purchased 3.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter and we ended the year with $476 million of availability under our authorization. The strength of our balance sheet puts us in a position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise during the course of this downcycle, whether they be through organic investments in our business, acquisitions or just on share repurchases.
Now turning to the 2015 outlook. We are confident in our ability to execute our backlog. $5.7 billion of which is scheduled to ship out in '15. However, our shorter cycle businesses, which generated $4.4 billion of revenues in '14 will be challenged by the current market conditions. Our customers are continuing to adjust their spending plans, which has clouded our ability to predict what the level of shorter cycle revenue will be in '15.
As a result, we do not believe we can provide you accurate guidance regarding earnings per share given the uncertainty around our shorter-cycle businesses and that explains why we were discussing our segments in more detail. We do believe that our new segment presentation we aid investors in thinking about the range of possible earnings Cameron may generate in this uncertain market.
To help you think through each of our segments, I'll cover some important points. Our Subsea segment has significant portion of its 2015 revenues and backlog. In fact, $2.1 billion of its backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. To help you think about how Subsea shorter cycles businesses may affect its 2015 revenue, 2014 fell approximately $800 million of such revenue, which primarily represents services. These services typically do not experience as much contraction in a downmarket as does our Surface segment. Therefore, we see a lot less revenue risks in this segment.
Given our focus on backlog and margins ver the past several years, our Surface Subsea segment should see margin expansion in 2015 when compared to the full year '14 margin of 6.7, however, it will come down from the fourth quarter level of 10%.
With the success of our CAM Shell initiatives over the last 4 years, our Surface segment has become heavier weighted towards a more service-intensive North American market. Therefore the current market correction will have a pronounced impact on the North American portion of this segment. However, the international portion, which comprises half of Surface, will be more insulated from the current microenvironment.
A few data points: Approximately $750 million of Surface's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, Surface had approximately $1.7 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, which will be impact by the reduced activity levels. While our customers are typically the more longer-term focused customers, Surface will not be immune from the reduced activity levels nor the pricing pressures, which are being experienced in North America. Surface's shorter-cycle businesses are somewhat protected from the full blunt of the reduced activity level due to value proposition we deliver to our customers, however, it will certainly see downward pressure on its operating margin in '15.
Drilling has approximately $2 billion of its backlog, which will ship in '15. In 2014, Drilling had approximately $800 million of shorter-cycle businesses, which is centered around our Surface and land BLD markets. Therefore, this portion of this business will be impacted by the downcycle. However, continued improvement and internal efficiency could allow us to grow Drilling's 2015 operating margin slightly from '14 level of 15.5%, depending on the ultimate level of pricing pressure we experience. Approximately $850 million of V&M backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, V&M had approximately $1.2 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, a significant amount of which was focused on North America activity. V&M is different than Surfaces and North American businesses, and that's a significant portion of V&M North American business goes through distributors. 
During cyclical downturns, V&M experiences a painful destocking process, whereby this are bidders bleed off existing inventories before ordering new inventory. Therefore, the downturn will have a more is significant impact on V&M's revenue when compared to Surfaces, which revenue decline will put significant downward pressure on V&M's operating margin percent.
Now a few overall comments for Cameron. Cameron's consolidated operating margin, which includes corporate expenses but excludes interests and other costs, contracted 170 basis points during the '08 downturn. While the company isn't much different today than it was during the 2008 time period, we will certainly see a contraction still in our 2015 overall consolidated margin.
At this time, however, we see that contraction being somewhat less than the 170 basis points I mentioned.
A few other 2015 items. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. [indiscernible] segment revenues to be about $160 million and the corresponding amount of margin to eliminate on these sales is $35 million. Our tax rate, 23%. Our CapEx will come down to approximately 300  to 350, while focused on majority focus on revenue-generating assets. Corporate expenses to approximate $130 million and interest should be about $140 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So it's really getting people back to ground and back to things that we've already done. So you can actually catch up time and reduce time by doing this.

We see a lot of opportunities with going in and creating duties as, they say, around existing environments and step out and so forth that are already in place.

First of all come its internal costs and making sure that we can all sit anything we do internally through just more efficient activities in ourselves or more through our own supply chain network. The other is really working with customers to broaden our share of their footprint where we can defer some of that costs across more volume and that is something we were successful doing the last cycle. And also given the relationships we have with customers today, most of them are focused not only on costs but efficiency and how can they be more efficient at the well side, consumed less product or consume last time and we even have that's we've got a great platform to work with them especially on the Surface systems where we have the most efficient Surface wellhead systems literarily in the world. And we've been able to prove that with customers. So we will leverage that to -- versus just roll over and concede pricing.

And so what we're trying to do on a standardization effort and some of the other things that we're doing within OneSubsea is really trying to shorten that cycle from time of order to time of equipment. And what we're doing is standardizing the shale specifications or standardized quality plans, we're standardizing welding specifications. And by doing that, we taking out a lot of people, we're taking out a lot of time. And anytime you can reduce that cycle time, you're driving pretty significant cost out of the equation. So we've been doing this now for about 3 years.

Cameron reported fourth quarter earnings today of $1.34 per share from continued operations excluding other costs, an increase of 33% versus year-ago quarter. The primary driver for these improved results was the operating performance of our Drilling and Surface segments along with a significant reduction in the company's overhead expense. Most notably, our Drilling segment reported a 89% increase in operating income and an almost 700 basis point improvement in margin relative to the year-ago quarter, while the Surface business reported a 23% increase in operating income. 
Consolidated SG&A expense declined 11% relative to the year-ago quarter. On a consolidated basis, these factors contributed to an operating income margin of 15% for Cameron. Additionally, the company generated $938 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an increase of 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and reflected in part our sharpened focus on reducing working capital.
Overall, 2014 was a great year for Cameron on a number of fronts. Most impressive was the turnaround story with our Drilling Systems. As previously mentioned, we saw a 700 basis point improvement in margins versus year-ago levels. Even more importantly, we have now embedded both processes and work practices that have driven predictable success in executing our backlog.
We are also very pleased with the timing and the outcome of the divestiture process with compression. Not only did we generate $1.5 billion of sales proceeds, it also allowed us to sharpen our focus on Cameron's core oil and gas businesses. We implemented a number of cost reduction programs that began the process to streamline our support structure across all of our business units, which proved to be meaningful contributor to improving overall margins. 
We returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014, while maintaining a very healthy balance sheet. And the momentum we created with investing and broadening the platform of our core businesses will benefit us in a market where customers' attention turns cost and efficiency versus just availability.
Now some comments regarding outlook for 2015, and I will start with our onshore markets. Clearly, we are witnessing a very sharp correction in activity that will negatively impact our Surface, Valves and Drilling segments in 2015. North America will be impacted much harder than international. The degree to which North America activity correct is still unknown. The range of possibilities will be heavily influenced by both the customer and the basin. 
Cameron has a broad presence in North America and we have a very broad customer base. Mostly populated with IOCs, major independents and the major drilling contractors, all of which we se as a positive to have in this environment. Cameron also has a very large international onshore presence which will contract at a slower rate, and in some markets could even expand. Cameron's customer base is made up mostly of large IOCs and NOCs whose attitudes towards investing through cycles have proven to be more predictable. 
As for our offshore in deepwater markets, OneSubsea, Drilling Systems and Valve markets will all be exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing, offshore as well. We saw the pause button hit on most deepwater drilling capital spending last year and nothing in our view has changed with the exception that we are not seeing drilling contractors actually scrap older generation rigs. Something we have rarely seen in prior year cycles which, in time, is a positive for some form of newbuild recovery. We will seek some compression in the services part of our businesses due to the lower utilization and pricing, but we also see opportunity to serve a broader portfolio of products from our rig equipment acquisitions. 
As for Subsea projects, most every perspective project we are tracking has or is going through a recalibration process for both scope and price. Some of this work actually started last year. While we fully expect to see projects award in 2015, the value or result of these exercises maybe different from what we were thinking 6 months ago. The importance of deepwater projects in our customers' portfolios have not changed. The timing on which one cycle to the forefront and the current cost environment will, which I'll place to the strengths that OneSubsea was created to deliver.
Having said all of that, I'll remind you that Cameron has a substantial backlog of work. And that backlog provides us with good visibility into a portion of our 2015 operating revenues and margins. And our confidence to deliver that backlog at the margins and in the time frame we have in our plan is very high, given the performance we've seen throughout 2014.
However, we will see our equally, if not more important, shorter cycle booked and built businesses meaningfully impacted by the current environment. And the speed in which we have seen the correction in this cycle over the past months has created significant uncertainty with the degree that this will impact both the revenues and margins of our short-cycle businesses, especially those in North America.
Given we're still very early in the cycle, it would be challenging to predict the range of outcomes within our budget and therefore, feel it's prudent not providing annual EPS guidance for 2015. Chuck will, however, provide detailed commentary on each of our operating segments.
While trying to speculate on the depth and duration of this cycle, corrections will be difficult. Rest assured that Cameron will stay very close to our customers to ensure we are advancing and investing the most cost efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our call structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms. You can also expect us to leverage our broad product, customer and geographic diversity to expand share. Every operator is currently reviewing their supplier's performance to ensure that they have the most cost-effective partner in this environment, and that will open doors for Cameron. This competitive drive will help us weather this cycle, as we have weathered previous cycles, and emerge as an even more formidable company over the longer term.
I will now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

The weak macro environment, as Jack described, is certainly evident when you look at Cameron's orders and backlog position in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.7:1, as order intake declined in all of our businesses on a sequential quarter basis. There were, however, a couple of bright spots of customer activity during the fourth quarter. In particular, we booked a multiyear contract with ExxonMobil for topside wellhead equipment and production trees for the Hebron project, a 52-well development located offshore Newfoundland, as well as OneSubsea's execution of a Subsea well-intervention alliance with Helix and Schlumberger. 
Nevertheless, the order flow was weak and the net result of that was a decline in our backlog to roughly $9.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Despite the reduction in backlog, the backlog itself is substantial, especially in our longer cycle businesses, OneSubsea and Drilling. The organization is highly focused on our ability to execute our backlog and the operational improvements realized in 2014 will carry over into 2015.
As Jack said, in this challenging macro environment, Cameron is absolutely focused on the things they can control. We are committed to our objective of delivering steady improvement in our consolidated operating margins, on average, over time. To be clear, over a multiyear period, some of these improvement could be temporarily masked by pricing pressure and reduced volumes, but we are confident in our ability to keep advancing this program over the long term and driving excellence in our ability to execute.
We are seeking to do this through continuous improvements in virtually every aspect of our operations from our supply chain to product delivery and throughout our corporate and support services organizations. We are finding ways to work smarter, faster and more efficiently and more creatively interesting we do. 
We also want to ensure that we're operating at maximum cost effectiveness. The cost reduction steps that were taken in 2014 are helping us prepare for 2015. We will, and have already taken further cost reductions in the first quarter, and we will continue to aggressively drive our cost structure down throughout the year as we work off the backlog.
In addition to volume reduction, the other challenge we are facing is pricing. The majority of our customers are seeking or have already asked for price concessions to help them weather the current environment. And Cameron's response to this request has been a proactive and collaborative approach. We are working with our customers to provide improved technology in processes, while we reduce their overall spending commitments and their operating costs. We feel that the largest cost savings for operators will come from a drive towards standardization, improved technology and further customer integration. We are in the early days but we are already seeing a few wins with this approach.
Each of our businesses will have different drivers and behave differently throughout the downcycle. Having completed our divestiture program in 2014, we are committed to each of our 4 operating segments, and I'm confident that we will emerge through this cycle better than ever. OneSubsea will continue to build on the quarter process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments. We continue to progress in this endeavor and operators will need help finding cost effective solutions to generate higher production from their deepwater assets.
Our Surface division is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform in a relative basis and grow market share by providing the highest service level and the best reliability in the industry. In Drilling, we will take this opportunity in the downturn to complete a comprehensive and integrated drilling offering. Our Valves & Measurement segment touches everything we do in Cameron in every segment of our businesses. We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement outperforms in this business cycle.
While we're actively and realistically facing the current market situation, Cameron is poised to take advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves. We're being proactive in our approach to manage our customers and our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. The activities and programs that we're implementing now will position Cameron for a long-term success and outperformance throughout the cycle. 
I'll now turn it over to Chuck for the financials."

Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts our models. Revenues for the quarter wer",1302,"Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts our models. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.8 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. Segment operating income margins were 15% for the quarter, flat sequentially but up 200 basis points from prior year level. Corporate expenses for the quarter were $35 million and EPS before other costs was a $1.34, an all-time quarterly record.
The key message in our fourth quarter financials is the operating margin improvement we've made throughout 2014. The improvements have come from better efficiency in our plants, as well as tight control over our costs, and these will serve us well during the downturn.
Subsea revenues increased 12% sequentially, whilst operating margin improved to 10%, reflecting the strength of our margin and backlog. We are pleased with the sequential progression that recognize the need to continue to grow our services offering in this segment to further enhance margins.
Our Surface revenues increased 10% sequentially and represented the highest revenue level in our history, driven primarily by North America. This operating margin improved 110 basis points sequentially, driven by the higher revenue level as well as improved mix in North America.
Drilling revenues increased 2% sequentially. To give you some perspective on the improvements Drilling has made over the last 12 months, the fourth quarter revenue is 20% higher than it was in the year-ago period. Operating margin for Drilling was 18.5%, which is below the previous quarter simply due to mix. The fourth quarter operating margin is 850 basis points higher than the low point we saw in Q1 of this year.
V&M revenues decreased 5% sequentially as it has struggled with orders and pricing in its engineered valve lines all year. As a result, we were hit hard this quarter with absorption challenges and lower margin engineered valve shipments, which resulted in a decline in Q4 operating margin to 15.3%. We're in the midst of completing a realignment of this segment, which will allow us to capture additional market share while lowering our costs at the same time.
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $938 million, obviously, a record level as our working capital efficiency drive begins to show results. As a result, we ended the year with $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments. As we announced earlier in the month, we completed our sale of our Centrifugal Compression business. And our net proceeds, after taxes, are estimated to be $600 million. As a result of the sale, we will recognize that estimated gain, for financial statement purposes, of approximately $400 million, which will be reflected in discontinued ops in Q1.
We purchased 3.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter, and we ended the year with $476 million of availability under our authorization. The strength of our balance sheet puts us in the position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise during the course of this downcycle. Whether they be through organic investments in our business, acquisitions or just on share repurchases.
Now turning to the 2015 outlook. We are confident in our ability to execute our backlog, $5.7 billion of which is scheduled to ship out in '15. However, our shorter cycle businesses, which generated $4.4 billion of revenues in '14, will be challenged by the current market conditions. Our customers are continuing to adjust their spending plans, which has clouded our ability to predict what the level of shorter cycle revenue will be in '15.
As a result, we do not believe we can provide you accurate guidance regarding earnings per share given the uncertainty around our shorter-cycle businesses, and that explains why we're discussing our segments in more detail. We do believe that our new segment presentation will aid investors in thinking about the range of possible earnings Cameron may generate in this uncertain market.
To help you think through each of our segments, I'll cover some important points. Our Subsea segment has significant portion of its 2015 revenues and backlog. In fact, $2.1 billion of its backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. To help you think about how Subsea shorter cycles businesses may affect its 2015 revenue, 2014 saw approximately $800 million of such revenue, which primarily represents services. These services typically do not experience as much contraction in a downmarket as does our Surface segment. Therefore, we see a lot less revenue risks in this segment. Given our focus on backlog and margins over the past several years, our Subsea segment should see margin expansion in 2015 when compared to the full year '14 margin of 6.7. However, it will come down from the fourth quarter level of 10%.
With the success of our CAM Shell initiative over the last 4 years, our Surface segment has become heavier weighted towards a more service-intensive North American market. Therefore the current market correction will have a pronounced impact on the North American portion of this segment. However, the international portion, which comprises half of Surface, will be more insulated from the current microenvironment.
A few data points: Approximately $750 million of Surface's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, Surface had approximately $1.7 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, which will be impacted by the reduced activity levels. While our customers are typically the more longer-term focused customers, Surface will not be immune from the reduced activity levels nor the pricing pressures which are being experienced in North America. Surface's shorter-cycle business is somewhat protected from the full blunt of the reduced activity level due to value proposition we deliver to our customers. However, it will certainly see downward pressure on its operating margin in '15.
Drilling has approximately $2 billion of its backlog which will ship in '15. In 2014, Drilling had approximately $800 million of shorter-cycle businesses which is centered around our services and land BOP markets. Therefore, this portion of this business will be impacted by the downcycle. However, continued improvement in internal efficiency could allow us to grow Drilling's 2015 operating margin slightly from '14's level of 15.5%, depending on the ultimate level of pricing pressure we experience. 
Approximately $850 million of V&M's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, V&M had approximately $1.2 billion of shorter-cycle businesses. A significant amount of which was focused on North America activity. V&M is different than Surfaces' North American business, and that a significant portion of V&M North American business goes through distributors. 
During cyclical downturns, V&M experiences a painful destocking process, whereby distributors bleed off existing inventories before ordering new inventory. Therefore, the downturn will have a more is significant impact on V&M's revenue when compared to Surfaces. This revenue decline will put significant downward pressure on V&M's operating margin percent.
Now a few overall comments for Cameron. Cameron's consolidated operating margin, which includes corporate expenses but excludes interests and other costs, contracted 170 basis points during the '08 downturn. While the company is much different today than it was during the 2008 time period, we will certainly see a contraction still in our 2015 overall consolidated margin. At this time, however, we see that contraction being somewhat less than the 170 basis points I mentioned.
A few other 2015 items. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Interest -- segment revenue should be about $160 million and the corresponding amount of margin to eliminate on these sales is $35 million. Our tax rate, 23%. Our CapEx will come down to approximately 300 to 350, all focused on -- or majority focus on revenue-generating assets. Corporate expenses should approximate $130 million and interest should be about $140 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

There will be some projects that will be awarded in 2015, no doubt. We expect that. But we do expect that there'll be some projects that we'd probably were looking at 6 months ago with more so certainty that could get shoved to the right even further. If they -- we are all working with customers right now to recalibrate costs, there's a lot of work going on around standardization, there's a lot of work going on with these guys in terms of how to remove some degree of complexity within the projects that they're looking at. A lot of this work started last year. So while it's hard to predict exactly where we will land by the end of the year, we do think that we have more risk, obviously, in '15 than we probably were thinking just 3 or 6 months ago."

And when we talked about standard solutions, it's not reinventing the wheel on welding specs and metallurgies and -- it's using things that we have all developed in the course of developing prior projects that are proven to be very, very robust and fit for purpose and the scope of the environment that they're working in. So it's really getting people back to ground and back to things that we've already done. So you can actually catch up time and reduce time by doing this. So some of these projects that have been recalibrated for the last 6 months, we could see those cycle out here fairly sooner than later in 2015."

And that's way we were comfortable telling people the downdraft in margin for the overall company should be less than the '08 cycle. I'll expand a little further on your question just to make sure everybody understood my commentary around volumes. We think Surface will contract less than the activity levels. It would suggest the reasons I have stated, and we think V&M will contract more for the reasons -- the distributor destocking. So you got to think about those things. But we are absolutely focused on the cost structure, our supply chain. What we've gone through in '14 prepares us so well and puts us so far ahead of this. I feel pretty comfortable, I feel very comfortable that our margin downdraft, absent something we're not expecting, should be less than in this downcycle than it was in the last downcycle."

Because we realized that the constraints on Deepwater are going to be more around reservoir recovery and how do you make that optimized in an environment where, and at least where we're going to be, maybe constrained on a hydrocarbon price over the next several years. But I think you really have to go look at this instead of huge deepwater developments. We see a lot of opportunities with going in and creating new cheese, as they say, around existing environments and to step out and so forth that are already in place. So we're working with a lot of operators to go in the existing and older fields where infrastructure is there, utilize some of our Subsea processing technologies and some of the advances we're making in dual lift and lift systems to help change the economics of those opportunities.

The other is really working with customers to broaden our share of their footprint where we can defer some of that costs across more volume. And that is something we were successful doing the last cycle. And I tell you with the relationships we have with customers today, most of them are focused not only on costs but efficiency. How can they be more efficient at the well site, consume less product or consume less time. And we have -- we've got a great platform to work with them on that, especially on the Surface systems where we have the most efficient Surface wellhead system, literarily, in the world.

But what ourselves and the peer group on providing the Subsea equipment are doing are really trying to make those projects much more efficient in taking time and people out of the equation.

And so what we're trying to do on our standardization effort and some of the other things that we're doing within OneSubsea is really try to shorten that cycle from time of order to time of equipment. And what we're doing is standardizing material specifications, we're standardizing quality plans, we're standardizing welding specifications. And by doing that, we're taking out a lot of people, we're taking out a lot of time. And anytime you can reduce that cycle time, you're driving pretty significant cost out of the equation. So we've been doing this now for about 3 years. We're having some very significant wins with some of our operators and partners.

Cameron reported fourth quarter earnings today of $1.34 per share from continued operations, excluding other costs, an increase of 33% versus year-ago quarter. The primary driver for these improved results was the operating performance of our Drilling and Surface segments, along with a significant reduction in the company's overhead expense. Most notably, our Drilling segment reported a 89% increase in operating income and an almost 700-basis-point improvement in margin relative to the year-ago quarter, while the Surface business reported a 23% increase in operating income. 
Consolidated SG&A expense declined 11% relative to the year-ago quarter. On a consolidated basis, these factors contributed to an operating income margin of 15% for Cameron. Additionally, the company generated $938 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an increase of 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and reflected, in part, our sharpened focus on reducing working capital.
Overall, 2014 was a great year for Cameron on a number of fronts. Most impressive was the turnaround story with our Drilling Systems. As previously mentioned, we saw a 700-basis-point improvement in margins versus year-ago levels. Even more importantly, we have now embedded both processes and work practices that have driven predictable success in executing our backlog.
We are also very pleased with the timing and the outcome of the divestiture process with compression. Not only did we generate $1.5 billion of sales proceeds, it also allowed us to sharpen our focus on Cameron's core oil and gas businesses. We implemented a number of cost reduction programs that began the process to streamline our support structure across all of our business units, which proved to be a meaningful contributor to improving overall margins. 
We returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014, while maintaining a very healthy balance sheet. And the momentum we created with investing and broadening the platform of our core businesses will benefit us in a market where customers' attention turns cost and efficiency versus just availability.
Now some comments regarding our outlook for 2015, and I will start with our onshore markets. Clearly, we are witnessing a very sharp correction in activity that will negatively impact our Surface, Valves and Drilling segments in 2015. North America will be impacted much harder than international. The degree to which North America activity will correct is still unknown. The range of possibilities will be heavily influenced by both the customer and the basin. 
Cameron has a broad presence in North America and we have a very broad customer base, mostly populated with IOCs, major independents and the major drilling contractors, all of which we see as a positive to have in this environment. Cameron also has a very large international onshore presence which will contract at a slower rate and in some markets could even expand. Cameron's customer base is made up mostly of large IOCs and NOCs whose attitudes towards investing through cycles have proven to be more predictable. 
As for our offshore and deepwater markets, OneSubsea, Drilling Systems and Valve markets will all be exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing, offshore as well. We saw the pause button hit on most deepwater drilling capital spending last year and nothing in our view has changed, with the exception that we are not seeing drilling contractors actually scrap older generation rigs. Something we have rarely seen in prior year cycles which, in time, is a positive for some form of newbuild recovery. We will seek some compression in the services part of our businesses due to the lower utilization and pricing, but we also see opportunity to serve a broader portfolio of products from our rig equipment acquisitions. 
As for Subsea projects, most every perspective project we are tracking has or is going through a recalibration process for both scope and price. Some of this work actually started last year. While we fully expect to see projects awarded in 2015, the value or result of these exercises may be different from what we were thinking 6 months ago. The importance of deepwater projects in our customers' portfolios has not changed. The timing on which one cycle to the forefront and the current cost environment will, which all plays to the strengths that OneSubsea was created to deliver.
Having said all of that, I'll remind you that Cameron has a substantial backlog of work. And that backlog provides us with good visibility into a portion of our 2015 operating revenues and margins. And our confidence to deliver that backlog at the margins and in the time frame we have in our plan is very high, given the performance we've seen throughout 2014.
However, we will see our equally, if not more important, shorter-cycle book and bill businesses meaningfully impacted by the current environment. And the speed in which we have seen the correction in this cycle over the past months has created significant uncertainty with the degree that this will impact both the revenues and margins of our short-cycle businesses, especially those in North America.
Given we're still very early in the cycle, it would be challenging to predict the range of outcomes within our budget and, therefore, feel it's prudent not providing annual EPS guidance for 2015. Chuck will, however, provide detailed commentary on each of our operating segments.
While trying to speculate on the depth and duration of this cycle, corrections will be difficult. Rest assured that Cameron will stay very close to our customers to ensure we are advancing and investing the most cost-efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our cost structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms. You can also expect us to leverage our broad product, customer and geographic diversity to expand share. Every operator is currently reviewing their supplier's performance to ensure that they have the most cost-effective partner in this environment, and that will open doors for Cameron. This competitive drive will help us weather this cycle, as we have weathered previous cycles, and emerge as an even more formidable company over the longer term.
I will now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

Before we I get into what we need to do in 2015, I would like to reiterate what Jack said regarding our performance in 2014. Cameron had our safest year ever, while providing products and services at a record level. We drove our cost structure down every quarter in 2014 while performing at this record activity rate. The focus on execution, cost reduction and servicing our customers results in strong margin progression throughout the year. The fourth quarter results were a culmination of a lot of hard work and diligence that positions the enterprise in a better place to perform on the challenges that we face in 2015.
Now let's switch gears to the present, in 2015. The weak macro environment that Jack described is certainly evident when you look at Cameron's orders and backlog position in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.7:1, as order intake declined in all of our businesses on a sequential quarter basis. There were, however, a couple of bright spots of customer activity during the fourth quarter. In particular, we booked a multiyear contract with ExxonMobil for topside wellhead equipment and production trees for the Hebron project, a 52-well development located offshore Newfoundland, as well as OneSubsea's execution of a Subsea well-intervention alliance with Helix and Schlumberger. 
Nevertheless, the order flow was weak and the net result of that was a decline in our backlog to roughly $9.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Despite the reduction in backlog, the backlog itself is substantial, especially in our longer-cycle businesses, OneSubsea and Drilling. The organization is highly focused on our ability to execute our backlog and the operational improvements realized in 2014 will carry over into 2015.
As Jack said, in this challenging macro environment, Cameron is absolutely focused on the things they can control. We are committed to our objective of delivering steady improvement in our consolidated operating margins, on average, over time. To be clear, over a multiyear period, some of this improvement could be temporarily masked by pricing pressure and reduced volumes, but we are confident in our ability to keep advancing this program over the long term and driving excellence in our ability to execute.
We are seeking to do this through continuous improvements in virtually every aspect of our operations, from our supply chain to product delivery, and throughout our corporate and support services organizations. We are finding ways to work smarter, faster and more efficiently and more creatively in everything we do. 
We also want to ensure that we're operating at maximum cost effectiveness. The cost-reduction steps that were taken in 2014 are helping us prepare for 2015. We will and have already taken further cost reductions in the first quarter, and we will continue to aggressively drive our cost structure down throughout the year as we work off the existing backlog.
In addition to volume reduction, the other challenge we are facing is pricing. The majority of our customers are seeking or have already asked for price concessions to help them weather the current environment. The Cameron response to this request has been a proactive and collaborative approach. We are working with our customers to provide improved technology in processes that will reduce their overall spending commitments and their operating costs. We feel that the largest cost savings for operators will come from a drive towards standardization, improved technology and further customer integration. We are in the early days, but we are already seeing a few wins with this approach.
Each of our businesses will have different drivers and behave differently throughout the downcycle. Having completed our divestiture program in 2014, we are committed to each of our 4 operating segments, and I am confident that we will emerge through this cycle better than ever. OneSubsea will continue to build on the Pore to Process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments. We continue to progress in this endeavor and operators will need help finding cost-effective solutions that generate higher production from their deepwater assets.
Our Surface division is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform on a relative basis and grow market share by providing the highest service level and the best reliability in the industry. In Drilling, we will take this opportunity in the downturn to complete a comprehensive and integrated drilling offering. Our Valves & Measurement segment touches everything we do in Cameron in every segment of our businesses. We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement outperforms in this business cycle.
While we are actively and realistically facing the current market situation, Cameron is poised to take advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves. We're being proactive in our approach to manage our customers and our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. The activities and programs that we are implementing now will position Cameron for a long-term success and outperformance throughout the cycle. 
I'll now turn it over to Chuck for the financials."
19839,275962311,751492,"Cameron International Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts their models. Revenues for the quarter w",1297,"Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts their models. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.8 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. Segment operating income margins were 15% for the quarter, flat sequentially but up 200 basis points from prior year level. Corporate expenses for the quarter were $35 million and EPS before other costs was a $1.34, an all-time quarterly record.
The key message in our fourth quarter financials is the operating margin improvement we've made throughout 2014. The improvements have come from better efficiency in our plants, as well as tight control over our costs, and these will serve us well during the downturn.
Subsea revenues increased 12% sequentially, while its operating margin improved to 10%, reflecting the strength of our margin and backlog. We are pleased with the sequential progression and recognize the need to continue to grow our services offering in this segment to further enhance margins.
Our Surface revenues increased 10% sequentially and represented the highest revenue level in our history, driven primarily by North America. This operating margin improved 110 basis points sequentially, driven by the higher revenue level as well as improved mix in North America.
Drilling's revenues increased 2% sequentially. To give you some perspective on the improvements Drilling has made over the last 12 months, the fourth quarter revenue is 20% higher than it was in the year-ago period. Operating margin for Drilling was 18.5%, which is below the previous quarter simply due to mix. The fourth quarter operating margin is 850 basis points higher than the low point we saw in Q1 of this year.
V&M revenues decreased 5% sequentially, as it has struggled with orders and pricing in its engineered valve lines all year. As a result, we were hit hard this quarter with absorption challenges and lower-margin engineered valve shipments, which resulted in a decline in Q4 operating margin to 15.3%. We're in the midst of completing a realignment of this segment, which will allow us to capture additional market share while lowering our costs at the same time.
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $938 million, obviously, a record level, as our working capital efficiency drive begins to show results. As a result, we ended the year with $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments. As we announced earlier in the month, we completed our sale of our Centrifugal Compression business. And our net proceeds, after taxes, are estimated to be $600 million. As a result of the sale, we will recognize that estimated gain, for financial statement purposes, of approximately $400 million, which will be reflected in discontinued ops in Q1.
We purchased 3.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter, and we ended the year with $476 million of availability under our authorization. The strength of our balance sheet puts us in the position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise during the course of this downcycle. Whether they be through organic investments in our business, acquisitions or just in share repurchases.
Now turning to the 2015 outlook. We are confident in our ability to execute our backlog, $5.7 billion of which is scheduled to ship out in '15. However, our shorter-cycle businesses, which generated $4.4 billion of revenues in '14, will be challenged by the current market conditions. Our customers are continuing to adjust their spending plans, which has clouded our ability to predict what the level of shorter-cycle revenue will be in '15.
As a result, we do not believe we can provide you accurate guidance regarding earnings per share given the uncertainty around our shorter-cycle businesses, and that explains why we're discussing our segments in more detail. We do believe that our new segment presentation will aid investors in thinking about the range of possible earnings Cameron may generate in this uncertain market.
To help you think through each of our segments, I'll cover some important points. Our Subsea segment has a significant portion of its 2015 revenues and backlog. In fact, $2.1 billion of its backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. To help you think about how Subsea shorter-cycles businesses may affect its 2015 revenue, 2014 saw approximately $800 million of such revenue, which primarily represents services. These services typically do not experience as much contraction in a downmarket as does our Surface segment. Therefore, we see a lot less revenue risks in this segment. Given our focus on backlog margins over the past several years, our Subsea segment should see margin expansion in 2015 when compared to the full year '14 margin of 6.7. However, it will come down from the fourth quarter level of 10%.
With the success of our CAM Shell initiative over the last 4 years, our Surface segment has become heavier weighted towards a more service-intensive North American market. Therefore, the current market correction will have a pronounced impact on the North American portion of this segment. However, the international portion, which comprises half of Surface, will be more insulated from the current macro environment.
A few data points: Approximately $750 million of Surface's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, Surface had approximately $1.7 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, which will be impacted by the reduced activity levels. While our customers are typically the more longer-term-focused customers, Surface will not be immune from the reduced activity levels nor the pricing pressures which are being experienced in North America. Surface's shorter-cycle business is somewhat protected from the full blunt of the reduced activity level due to the value proposition we deliver to our customers. However, it will certainly see downward pressure on its operating margin in '15.
Drilling has approximately $2 billion of its backlog which will ship in '15. In 2014, Drilling had approximately $800 million of shorter-cycle businesses, which is centered around our services and land BOP markets. Therefore, this portion of the business will be impacted by the downcycle. However, continued improvement in internal efficiency could allow us to grow Drilling's 2015 operating margin slightly from '14's level of 15.5%, depending on the ultimate level of pricing pressure we experience. 
Approximately $850 million of V&M's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, V&M had approximately $1.2 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, a significant amount of which was focused on North America activity. V&M is different than Surfaces' North American business, and that a significant portion of V&M North American business goes through distributors. 
During cyclical downturns, V&M experiences a painful destocking process, whereby distributors bleed off existing inventories before ordering new inventory. Therefore, the downturn will have a more significant impact on V&M's revenue when compared to Surfaces. This revenue decline will put significant downward pressure on V&M's operating margin percent.
Now a few overall comments for Cameron. Cameron's consolidated operating margin, which includes corporate expenses but excludes interests and other costs, contracted 170 basis points during the '08 downturn. While the company is much different today than it was during the 2008 time period, we will certainly see a contraction still in our 2015 overall consolidated margin. At this time, however, we see that contraction being somewhat less than the 170 basis points I mentioned.
A few other 2015 items. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Intersegment revenues should be about $160 million and the corresponding amount of margin to eliminate on these sales is $35 million. Our tax rate, 23%. Our CapEx will come down to approximately 300 to 350, all focused on -- or majority focus on revenue-generating assets. Corporate expenses should approximate $130 million and interest should be about $140 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

What we saw in the last cycle is that our overall pricing relief will be something far less than that. And how we have to manage that is on a number of fronts, right? First of all there's internal cost and making sure that we can offset anything we do internally through just more efficient activities on ourselves or more through our own supply chain network. The other is really working with customers to broaden our share of their footprint where we can defer some of that cost across more volume. And that is something we were successful doing the last cycle. And I tell you, with the relationships we have with customers today, most of them are focused not only on costs but efficiency. How can they be more efficient at the well site, consume less product or consume less time. And we have -- we've got a great platform to work with them on that, especially on the Surface systems where we have the most efficient Surface wellhead system, literarily, in the world. And we've been able to prove that with a lot of customers. So we will leverage that to -- versus just roll over and concede pricing.

But what ourselves and the peer group on providing the Subsea equipment are doing are really trying to make those projects much more efficient in taking time and people out of the equation.

And so what we're trying to do on our standardization effort and some of the other things that we're doing within OneSubsea is really try to shorten that cycle from time of order to time of equipment. And what we're doing is standardizing material specifications. Were standardizing quality plans. We're standardizing welding specifications. And by doing that, we're taking out a lot of people, we're taking out a lot of time. And anytime you can reduce that cycle time, you're driving pretty significant cost out of the equation. So we've been doing this now for about 3 years. We're having some very significant wins with some of our operators and partners.

So those markets have been very constructive for us. North Sea, we saw it decline last year and we really haven't seen it stop declining. So I think you're going to continue to see the North Sea cycle down relative to where we were in this past year."

Cameron reported fourth quarter earnings today of $1.34 per share from continued operations, excluding other costs, an increase of 33% versus year-ago quarter. The primary driver for these improved results was the operating performance of our Drilling and Surface segments, along with a significant reduction in the company's overhead expense. Most notably, our Drilling segment reported a 89% increase in operating income and an almost 700-basis-point improvement in margin relative to the year-ago quarter, while the Surface business reported a 23% increase in operating income. 
Consolidated SG&A expense declined 11% relative to the year-ago quarter. On a consolidated basis, these factors contributed to an operating income margin of 15% for Cameron. Additionally, the company generated $938 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an increase of 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and reflected, in part, our sharpened focus on reducing working capital.
Overall, 2014 was a great year for Cameron on a number of fronts. Most impressive was the turnaround story with our Drilling Systems. As previously mentioned, we saw a 700-basis-point improvement in margins versus year-ago levels. Even more importantly, we have now embedded both processes and work practices that have driven predictable success in executing our backlog.
We are also very pleased with the timing and the outcome of the divestiture process with compression. Not only did we generate $1.5 billion of sales proceeds, it also allowed us to sharpen our focus on Cameron's core oil and gas businesses. We implemented a number of cost reduction programs that began the process to streamline our support structure across all of our business units, which proved to be a meaningful contributor to improving overall margins. 
We returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014, while maintaining a very healthy balance sheet. And the momentum we created with investing and broadening the platform of our core businesses will benefit us in a market where customers' attention turns cost and efficiency versus just availability.
Now some comments regarding our outlook for 2015, and I will start with our onshore markets. Clearly, we are witnessing a very sharp correction in activity that will negatively impact our Surface, Valves and Drilling segments in 2015. North America will be impacted much harder than international. The degree to which North America activity will correct is still unknown. The range of possibilities will be heavily influenced by both the customer and the basin. 
Cameron has a broad presence in North America and we have a very broad customer base, mostly populated with IOCs, major independents and the major drilling contractors, all of which we see as a positive to have in this environment. Cameron also has a very large international onshore presence which will contract at a slower rate and in some markets could even expand. Cameron's customer base is made up mostly of large IOCs and NOCs whose attitudes towards investing through cycles have proven to be more predictable. 
As for our offshore and deepwater markets, OneSubsea, Drilling Systems and Valve markets will all be exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing, offshore as well. We saw the pause button hit on most deepwater drilling capital spending last year and nothing in our view has changed, with the exception that we are not seeing drilling contractors actually scrap older generation rigs. Something we have rarely seen in prior year cycles which, in time, is a positive for some form of newbuild recovery. We will seek some compression in the services part of our businesses due to the lower utilization and pricing, but we also see opportunity to serve a broader portfolio of products from our rig equipment acquisitions. 
As for Subsea projects, most every perspective project we are tracking has or is going through a recalibration process for both scope and price. Some of this work actually started last year. While we fully expect to see projects awarded in 2015, the value or result of these exercises may be different from what we were thinking 6 months ago. The importance of deepwater projects in our customers' portfolios has not changed. The timing on which one cycle to the forefront and the current cost environment will, which all plays to the strengths that OneSubsea was created to deliver.
Having said all of that, I'll remind you that Cameron has a substantial backlog of work. And that backlog provides us with good visibility into a portion of our 2015 operating revenues and margins. And our confidence to deliver that backlog at the margins and in the time frame we have in our plan is very high, given the performance we've seen throughout 2014.
However, we will see our equally, if not more important, shorter-cycle book and bill businesses meaningfully impacted by the current environment. And the speed in which we have seen the correction in this cycle over the past months has created significant uncertainty with the degree that this will impact both the revenues and margins of our short-cycle businesses, especially those in North America.
Given we're still very early in the cycle, it would be challenging to predict the range of outcomes within our budget and, therefore, feel it's prudent not providing annual EPS guidance for 2015. Chuck will, however, provide detailed commentary on each of our operating segments.
While trying to speculate on the depth and duration of this cycle, corrections will be difficult. Rest assured that Cameron will stay very close to our customers to ensure we are advancing and investing the most cost-efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our cost structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms. You can also expect us to leverage our broad product, customer and geographic diversity to expand share. Every operator is currently reviewing their supplier's performance to ensure that they have the most cost-effective partner in this environment, and that will open doors for Cameron. This competitive drive will help us weather this cycle, as we have weathered previous cycles, and emerge as an even more formidable company over the longer term.
I will now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

Before we I get into what we need to do in 2015, I would like to reiterate what Jack said regarding our performance in 2014. Cameron had our safest year ever, while providing products and services at a record level. We drove our cost structure down every quarter in 2014 while performing at this record activity rate. The focus on execution, cost reduction and servicing our customers results in strong margin progression throughout the year. The fourth quarter results were a culmination of a lot of hard work and diligence that positions the enterprise in a better place to perform on the challenges that we face in 2015.
Now let's switch gears to the present, in 2015. The weak macro environment that Jack described is certainly evident when you look at Cameron's orders and backlog position in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.7:1, as order intake declined in all of our businesses on a sequential quarter basis. There were, however, a couple of bright spots of customer activity during the fourth quarter. In particular, we booked a multiyear contract with ExxonMobil for topside wellhead equipment and production trees for the Hebron project, a 52-well development located offshore Newfoundland, as well as OneSubsea's execution of a Subsea well-intervention alliance with Helix and Schlumberger. 
Nevertheless, the order flow was weak and the net result of that was a decline in our backlog to roughly $9.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Despite the reduction in backlog, the backlog itself is substantial, especially in our longer-cycle businesses, OneSubsea and Drilling. The organization is highly focused on our ability to execute our backlog and the operational improvements realized in 2014 will carry over into 2015.
As Jack said, in this challenging macro environment, Cameron is absolutely focused on the things they can control. We are committed to our objective of delivering steady improvement in our consolidated operating margins, on average, over time. To be clear, over a multiyear period, some of this improvement could be temporarily masked by pricing pressure and reduced volumes, but we are confident in our ability to keep advancing this program over the long term and driving excellence in our ability to execute.
We are seeking to do this through continuous improvements in virtually every aspect of our operations, from our supply chain to product delivery, and throughout our corporate and support services organizations. We are finding ways to work smarter, faster and more efficiently and more creatively in everything we do. 
We also want to ensure that we're operating at maximum cost effectiveness. The cost-reduction steps that were taken in 2014 are helping us prepare for 2015. We will and have already taken further cost reductions in the first quarter, and we will continue to aggressively drive our cost structure down throughout the year as we work off the existing backlog.
In addition to volume reduction, the other challenge we are facing is pricing. The majority of our customers are seeking or have already asked for price concessions to help them weather the current environment. The Cameron response to this request has been a proactive and collaborative approach. We are working with our customers to provide improved technology in processes that will reduce their overall spending commitments and their operating costs. We feel that the largest cost savings for operators will come from a drive towards standardization, improved technology and further customer integration. We are in the early days, but we are already seeing a few wins with this approach.
Each of our businesses will have different drivers and behave differently throughout the downcycle. Having completed our divestiture program in 2014, we are committed to each of our 4 operating segments, and I am confident that we will emerge through this cycle better than ever. OneSubsea will continue to build on the Pore to Process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments. We continue to progress in this endeavor and operators will need help finding cost-effective solutions that generate higher production from their deepwater assets.
Our Surface division is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform on a relative basis and grow market share by providing the highest service level and the best reliability in the industry. In Drilling, we will take this opportunity in the downturn to complete a comprehensive and integrated drilling offering. Our Valves & Measurement segment touches everything we do in Cameron in every segment of our businesses. We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement outperforms in this business cycle.
While we are actively and realistically facing the current market situation, Cameron is poised to take advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves. We're being proactive in our approach to manage our customers and our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. The activities and programs that we are implementing now will position Cameron for a long-term success and outperformance throughout the cycle. 
I'll now turn it over to Chuck for the financials."
19839,275962311,751499,"Cameron International Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts their models. Revenues for the quarter w",1297,"Thanks, Scott. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I just want to remind everybody that Scott Lamb is available after the call to help everybody work through the new segment reporting and how it impacts their models. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.8 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. Segment operating income margins were 15% for the quarter, flat sequentially but up 200 basis points from prior year level. Corporate expenses for the quarter were $35 million and EPS before other costs was a $1.34, an all-time quarterly record.
The key message in our fourth quarter financials is the operating margin improvement we've made throughout 2014. The improvements have come from better efficiency in our plants, as well as tight control over our costs, and these will serve us well during the downturn.
Subsea revenues increased 12% sequentially, while its operating margin improved to 10%, reflecting the strength of our margin and backlog. We are pleased with the sequential progression and recognize the need to continue to grow our services offering in this segment to further enhance margins.
Our Surface revenues increased 10% sequentially and represented the highest revenue level in our history, driven primarily by North America. This operating margin improved 110 basis points sequentially, driven by the higher revenue level as well as improved mix in North America.
Drilling's revenues increased 2% sequentially. To give you some perspective on the improvements Drilling has made over the last 12 months, the fourth quarter revenue is 20% higher than it was in the year-ago period. Operating margin for Drilling was 18.5%, which is below the previous quarter simply due to mix. The fourth quarter operating margin is 850 basis points higher than the low point we saw in Q1 of this year.
V&M revenues decreased 5% sequentially, as it has struggled with orders and pricing in its engineered valve lines all year. As a result, we were hit hard this quarter with absorption challenges and lower-margin engineered valve shipments, which resulted in a decline in Q4 operating margin to 15.3%. We're in the midst of completing a realignment of this segment, which will allow us to capture additional market share while lowering our costs at the same time.
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $938 million, obviously, a record level, as our working capital efficiency drive begins to show results. As a result, we ended the year with $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments. As we announced earlier in the month, we completed our sale of our Centrifugal Compression business. And our net proceeds, after taxes, are estimated to be $600 million. As a result of the sale, we will recognize that estimated gain, for financial statement purposes, of approximately $400 million, which will be reflected in discontinued ops in Q1.
We purchased 3.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter, and we ended the year with $476 million of availability under our authorization. The strength of our balance sheet puts us in the position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise during the course of this downcycle. Whether they be through organic investments in our business, acquisitions or just in share repurchases.
Now turning to the 2015 outlook. We are confident in our ability to execute our backlog, $5.7 billion of which is scheduled to ship out in '15. However, our shorter-cycle businesses, which generated $4.4 billion of revenues in '14, will be challenged by the current market conditions. Our customers are continuing to adjust their spending plans, which has clouded our ability to predict what the level of shorter-cycle revenue will be in '15.
As a result, we do not believe we can provide you accurate guidance regarding earnings per share given the uncertainty around our shorter-cycle businesses, and that explains why we're discussing our segments in more detail. We do believe that our new segment presentation will aid investors in thinking about the range of possible earnings Cameron may generate in this uncertain market.
To help you think through each of our segments, I'll cover some important points. Our Subsea segment has a significant portion of its 2015 revenues and backlog. In fact, $2.1 billion of its backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. To help you think about how Subsea shorter-cycles businesses may affect its 2015 revenue, 2014 saw approximately $800 million of such revenue, which primarily represents services. These services typically do not experience as much contraction in a downmarket as does our Surface segment. Therefore, we see a lot less revenue risks in this segment. Given our focus on backlog margins over the past several years, our Subsea segment should see margin expansion in 2015 when compared to the full year '14 margin of 6.7. However, it will come down from the fourth quarter level of 10%.
With the success of our CAM Shell initiative over the last 4 years, our Surface segment has become heavier weighted towards a more service-intensive North American market. Therefore, the current market correction will have a pronounced impact on the North American portion of this segment. However, the international portion, which comprises half of Surface, will be more insulated from the current macro environment.
A few data points: Approximately $750 million of Surface's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, Surface had approximately $1.7 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, which will be impacted by the reduced activity levels. While our customers are typically the more longer-term-focused customers, Surface will not be immune from the reduced activity levels nor the pricing pressures which are being experienced in North America. Surface's shorter-cycle business is somewhat protected from the full blunt of the reduced activity level due to the value proposition we deliver to our customers. However, it will certainly see downward pressure on its operating margin in '15.
Drilling has approximately $2 billion of its backlog which will ship in '15. In 2014, Drilling had approximately $800 million of shorter-cycle businesses, which is centered around our services and land BOP markets. Therefore, this portion of the business will be impacted by the downcycle. However, continued improvement in internal efficiency could allow us to grow Drilling's 2015 operating margin slightly from '14's level of 15.5%, depending on the ultimate level of pricing pressure we experience. 
Approximately $850 million of V&M's backlog is scheduled to ship in '15. In 2014, V&M had approximately $1.2 billion of shorter-cycle businesses, a significant amount of which was focused on North America activity. V&M is different than Surfaces' North American business, and that a significant portion of V&M North American business goes through distributors. 
During cyclical downturns, V&M experiences a painful destocking process, whereby distributors bleed off existing inventories before ordering new inventory. Therefore, the downturn will have a more significant impact on V&M's revenue when compared to Surfaces. This revenue decline will put significant downward pressure on V&M's operating margin percent.
Now a few overall comments for Cameron. Cameron's consolidated operating margin, which includes corporate expenses but excludes interests and other costs, contracted 170 basis points during the '08 downturn. While the company is much different today than it was during the 2008 time period, we will certainly see a contraction still in our 2015 overall consolidated margin. At this time, however, we see that contraction being somewhat less than the 170 basis points I mentioned.
A few other 2015 items. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Intersegment revenues should be about $160 million and the corresponding amount of margin to eliminate on these sales is $35 million. Our tax rate, 23%. Our CapEx will come down to approximately 300 to 350, all focused on -- or majority focus on revenue-generating assets. Corporate expenses should approximate $130 million and interest should be about $140 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And when we talked about standard solutions, it's not reinventing the wheel on welding specs and metallurgies and -- it's using things that we have all developed in the course of developing prior projects that have proven to be very, very robust and fit for purpose and the scope of the environment that they're working in. So it's really getting people back to ground and back to things that we've already done. So you can actually catch up time and reduce time by doing this. So some of these projects that have been recalibrated for the last 6 months, we could see those cycle out here fairly -- sooner than later in 2015."

Brad, right now every customer is asking for some degree of pricing relief and I would say most of it is in a double-digit context. What we saw in the last cycle is that our overall pricing relief will be something far less than that. And how we have to manage that is on a number of fronts, right? First of all there's internal cost and making sure that we can offset anything we do internally through just more efficient activities on ourselves or more through our own supply chain network. The other is really working with customers to broaden our share of their footprint where we can defer some of that cost across more volume. And that is something we were successful doing the last cycle. And I tell you, with the relationships we have with customers today, most of them are focused not only on costs but efficiency. How can they be more efficient at the well site, consume less product or consume less time. And we have -- we've got a great platform to work with them on that, especially on the Surface systems where we have the most efficient Surface wellhead system, literarily, in the world. And we've been able to prove that with a lot of customers. So we will leverage that to -- versus just roll over and concede pricing. And -- but it won't be as bad as what we are being asked to do, but I do think that we'll be able to offset a lot of our price discounting through more efficiencies internally. But we will not be able to escape it totally."

But what ourselves and the peer group on providing the Subsea equipment are doing are really trying to make those projects much more efficient in taking time and people out of the equation. And so typically on a large project, right, from the time you award to the time you start to deliver equipment is anywhere from a 2 -- you start to deliver equipment after year 1 into year 2 and year 3. And so what we're trying to do on our standardization effort and some of the other things that we're doing within OneSubsea is really try to shorten that cycle from time of order to time of equipment. And what we're doing is standardizing material specifications. Were standardizing quality plans. We're standardizing welding specifications. And by doing that, we're taking out a lot of people, we're taking out a lot of time. And anytime you can reduce that cycle time, you're driving pretty significant cost out of the equation. So we've been doing this now for about 3 years. We're having some very significant wins with some of our operators and partners. And I ultimately think that the overall costs will come down in a pretty significant magnitude as operators start to break some of the dynamics and possibly some of the bad habits that they are doing historically when developing these fields."

19839,284859562,792722,"Cameron International Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results f",983,"Thanks, Scott. Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results for the first quarter 2015 included a sizable gain on the sale of our Centrifugal business and a charge for the impairment of goodwill in our process systems business. Doug will provide the detail on those items.
Cameron executed well over the first 3 months of the year, and that helped to offset the seasonal first quarter weakness that we had expected. In particular, we saw accelerated benefits from our efforts to lower our fundamental cost structure and improve operational efficiency. Relative to year-ago quarter, both our Subsea and Drilling segments delivered sharp increases in operational income as they continued to successfully execute on their backlogs.
During the first quarter, operating income in our Surface segment remained relatively unchanged as cost reduction efforts and excellent execution mitigated the decline in orders for the segment's shorter-cycle business.
Operating income in our Valves & Measurement segment was down considerably, reflecting the impact of the quarters in 2014 and the destocking of distributor inventories, which I don't think comes as a surprise to everyone.
A big contributor to the company's first quarter results was the ongoing fundamental change in our cost structure that we began to implement in early 2014. This resulted in a significant decline in SG&A expense relative to the year-ago quarter. It's important to note that we are not talking about a short-term reaction to the downturn in the energy cycle, whether we are making systematic changes in the way we manage the entire Cameron enterprise. At every level of the organization from the corporate office all the way through each of our business. So clearly, we saw the benefit of this in our first quarter and we expect there will be more to come.
Now I would like to offer some commentary and what we have seen the markets we serve, and I'll start with the onshore markets. Sharp decline in customer spending is impacted and will continue -- and continue to impact our surface, drilling and V&M segments this year. As expected and certainly as indicated by the declining rig counts, industrywide downturn in spending is hitting North America much harder than our international markets. The result is predictable, as you saw in our Q1 orders for these 3 segments, which are down sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter. That said, I will also add that our North America customer base is broad and mostly populated with out cease, major independents and major drilling contractors, all of which we see as positive in this environment. Strong customer relationships often enable Cameron to gain share in the downturn, which we have already seen several examples of. 
I'm pleased to remember that Cameron has also a very large international onshore presence, which is contracting at a slower rate in North America. In fact, some markets could even expand in 2014 and 2015, the Middle East in particular.
As for the offshore Deepwater markets, our Subsea, Drilling and V&M segments are all exposed to the pullback and spending we are witnessing offshore as well. slowdown posing more of an intermediate term challenge to our Drilling and V&M businesses. We all know that capital spending in the Drilling markets has dropped off shortly. However, if we are looking for a silver lining in this market, I would say that the scrapping of the older rigs is a positive to some format of eventual newbuild recovery. I would also say that we are hopeful into the orders in the surface as part of our Drilling business will continue to be a bit more resilient than the equipment side of the business, as was the case in the first quarter.
As for Subsea projects, all of us in this business have been challenged by industrywide pressure to improve the economics of Deepwater developments. At OneSubsea, we are witnessing this pressure firsthand. Specifically almost every perspective project we are tracking has gone through or is going through some sort of second or third round of analysis and reengineering to reduce both scope and price.
Scott Rowe, in his prepared remarks, will cite a recent example of our success in this regard.
The good news is that the products and services we offer to our OneSubsea joint venture are targeted to help our customers achieve their objectives of improving the returns on the Deepwater projects, specifically by focusing on reservoir productivity and optimization. That's part of the reason that Subsea delivered strong operating income in new orders in the first quarter.
Having said all of that, I must also say that the speed of the cyclical downturn continues to create significant uncertainty across all the markets we serve. This is especially true in relation to the shorter-cycle businesses, which include services, although broadly speaking, we'd expect a percentage decline in order rates and services to be generally lower than for new equipment. And as you have heard me say before, we really don't think there's much to be gain by speculating about the depth and duration of this cycle, instead our focus will be to stay very close to our customers to ensure that we are advancing and investing the most cost-efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence; aggressively manage our cost structure to the reality of the business; and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms.
Cameron has a very broad offering of products and services at a global footprint. This profile position us to weather this downturn and emerge as an even stronger formidable company over the longer term.
Now I will turn over the discussion over to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

Cameron's new orders and backlog for the first quarter of 2015 declined sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the reduced activity levels across the industry that Jack just outlined for you. That should come as a surprise to no one. The first quarter book-to-bill ratios were below 1 for all 4 segments. In particular, Subsea was 0.89, Surface was 0.83, Drilling was 0.37 and V&M was 0.91. Nevertheless, the bright spot in orders was in our Subsea segment where the dollar value of orders was 30% above the year-ago quarter and 8% above the fourth quarter of 2014. The segment received orders for 23 Subsea trees in total, which is more than double the order rate in Q1 of 2014. The strength of the orders was due in part to the booking of a sizable Subsea Systems order, the VP West Nile Delta towards labor developing.
This is a contract valued at a couple hundred million dollars to supply Subsea systems for a major gas project offshore Egypt. The order includes 10 large for [ph] gas trees and related Subsea Systems. This project is a great example of customer-supplier collaboration. Specifically, OneSubsea were close to MVP to optimize technology of significantly reducing costs, which allow the project to move forward. The project is being executed on a fast-track schedule, utilizing a standardized horizontal gas tree and control system and first deliveries are expected in Q1 of 2016.
The project has 2 key characteristics that are typical of the kinds of Subsea projects that we believe will continue to be sanctioned. First, it includes an element of standardization that substantially reduce the cost to the operator without compromising our commitment to improving our returns in this business.
Second, it is driven by compelling need to address local energy demand. As a result of this award and in consideration of other probable large awards that we are pursuing, we are reaffirming our previous guidance that new orders in our Subsea segment for 2015 will be at or above the levels reported in 2014.
Patience and persistence, in addition to technical excellence, is a virtue in this business. The value proposition of our OneSubsea business remained as strong as ever, as demonstrated by our latest award and the by the progress reports we provided in March on 2 existing Subsea processing projects that are enabling our customers to significantly increase the recoveries.
I have the privilege to be at the [indiscernible] facility last month when we handed over the world's first Subsea compression system to the Statoil senior management team. This system will ultimately increase the recovery rate of Goalfax South [indiscernible] reservoir by more than 22 million barrels of oil equivalent. Additionally, Chevron recently commissioned the Subsea boosting system for the Jack and Saint Melo project in the Gulf of Mexico. This system is expected to yield an improvement of 10% to 30% new [ph] recovery, which equates to 50 billion to 150 billion barrels of additional oil recovery -- sorry, 150 million barrels of additional oil recovery over the life of the project. OneSubsea now has more than 20 boosting projects in operation today, generating substantial value to our customers.
In our other 3 segments, orders were down on a sequential quarter basis and as compared to the first quarter of 2014. On a consolidated basis, orders for service-related activities have provend to be more resilient than equipment orders, with the percent decline less than half the decline in the new orders.
Jack will walk you through our guidance for each of the 4 segments, but I think it's worth reminding you of the ways we are managing each of our businesses through the downcycle.
Surface segment is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform on a relative basis due in part to its sizable presence in international markets. The activity levels have not decreased as much as in North America and its CAM shale offering. As many of you know, CAM shales are comprehensive and innovative pressure control system for shale deposits in which continues to set a high standard for the industry in driving efficiency and cost reduction. CAM shale also gives us a platform that could be easily levered to gain incremental business. Surface segment performed better than our expectations in the first quarter, due in part to strong operations and cost control.
The Subsea segment, and really OneSubsea specifically, continues to build on a core to process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their Deepwater developments for an increase in production of even 5% or 10% can generate significant incremental returns. We continue to have meaningful discussions with operators as to how we can help them optimize cost and production. Our boosting technology's exceeding our expectations of reliability and improved recovery.
Our drilling division will take the opportunity of the downturn to continue to invest in the buildout of our comprehensive Deepwater drilling offering. We're in the process of delivering over 17 complete jack-up drilling equipment packages. Our focus in drilling will be on conforming through evolving regulations, size and liability and efficiency to new levels and standardizing our drilling offering.
Additionally, we are enhancing our service offering to provide the best long-term support for drilling contractors.
Our Valves & Measurement business touches everything we do in Cameron in every segment of our business. Cameron valves are sold to distributors and direct to customers under 20 premier brand names that are recognized worldwide as offering unsurpassed quality and technical performance. 
We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement performs to its full potential during this business cycle. This business is currently being impacted significantly by distributor destocking, but this business will respond quickly when the market in North America begins to stabilize.
Across the entire Cameron enterprise, we continue to be proactive in our approach to managing ours relationship with our customers and in managing our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. Our segment performed -- our segments performed well during the first quarter while under significant pressure from the market and our customers. We fully expect to remain proactive in our cost measures and our ability to execute the downturn.
In this cycle, we are absolutely focused on driving technical solutions that will bring cost reduction and efficiencies to our customers. We announced a new Vice President of Marketing and Technology in the quarter, who are committing more money to R&D this year than ever before. The activities and programs that we're implementing now will position Cameron for long-term success and outperformance throughout this cycle. Doug?"

First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. First was $538 million of after-tax, non-cash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in our",1738,"Thanks, Scott. First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. First was $538 million of after-tax, non-cash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in our 10-K when we said the gap between the fair value determined under accounting guidance and the carrying value of this business was pretty narrow. As part of our routine annual review of goodwill, which occurred during the first quarter, we noted that the market outlook had gotten worse since year end, which led us to conclude that an impairment charge was required under accounting rules, so we recorded it. It is ironic semi how accounting -- is sometimes how accounting rules work, especially in this case for a business that hard had one of its best year ever in '14.
Second item was the $429 million of income from discontinued ops, primarily associated with the gain of the sale of our Compression businesses. In addition to these 2 items, we also had $18 million of after-tax costs associated with downsizing the business, the mark-to-market adjustments related to currency hedges. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.3 billion, essentially flat with the year-ago period, although clearly down from the fourth quarter. Our North American Surface and V&M businesses, which represents the majority of our shorter-cycle businesses, were down 12% from the first quarter of '14 and 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This rate of decline will accelerate somewhat as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.
Consolidated segment operating income margins were 13.8 for the quarter, down sequentially but up by about 200 basis points from the first quarter of '14. As Jack touched on, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and you saw that show up in our first quarter results with SG&A down 10% versus year-ago quarter.
Operating EPS was $0.91, which is well above the year-ago quarter, although predictably down from the record level of earnings in the fourth quarter '14. We now expect this to be the high point of operating EPS for the year, given the macro conditions we are facing.
Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the fourth quarter and [ph] the first quarter of '14. Decline of revenues attributable to the relatively low level of '14 bookings. Operating income margin came in at 9%, more than double the year-ago quarter, with largely execution excellence as well as higher price backlog. The margin declined sequentially as expected, reflecting the seasonality of first quarter revenues. We expect Q1 to represent the low point for revenues for the year. Q2 margin should come down a bit from Q1 levels due to mix before increasing in Q3 and 4.
Surface revenues were essentially flat in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the year-ago period, but decline sequentially from what was a record level fourth quarter '14. Again, I don't think the sequential quarter revenue decline comes as a surprise to anyone. The North American business for Surface, which accounted for most of its shorter cycle businesses, was down 13% from the year-ago quarter and down 28% from the preceding quarter.
Surface operating income margin was 16.9% during the first quarter, which is flat with the year-ago quarter and down only moderately from the fourth quarter of '14. It's better than we had expected and reflects the success of these groups and working very hard to mitigate the decline in orders and pricing pressure for this segments shorter cycle business. Q1 should represent the high point in quarterly revenues and margins for the year as Surface's North American business begin to feel the full brunt of the activity decline in Q2.
Billing revenues were higher than the somewhat depressed levels in the first quarter of '14, but clearly down on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting both the impact of the declining backlog for new equipment and a 16% decline in aftermarket revenues caused by the depressed level of North American and offshore rig activity.
As is the case with our Surface business, Q1 may very well represent the high point for the quarterly revenues for Drilling this year. Operating income margin was 18.6%, which is more than 800 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of '14. I want to recognize our drilling team for the significant improvements they've made in execution over the past 12 months.
Q1 should be the high point in quarterly margins for this year, as the declining base of new equipment revenue and lower services revenue take their toll on margins.
Now V&M segment revenue declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the fourth quarter '14. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the market as well as the relatively light orders for this segment in '14.
North American business for V&M, which represents most of its short cycle business, was down about 10% as compared to the preceding and year-ago quarters due to weakness in North America. This decline will accelerate in coming quarters, as distributors continue to work off their excess inventories. However, as Scott mentioned, this will increase probably quicker than activity once that level of inventory is reached by our distributors.
Operating income margin in V&M was 10.5%, a sharp decline from the year-ago quarter period and the preceding quarter. Decline in margin reflects the impact of weak orders in '14 and the destocking of distributor inventories. Hopefully, this is the low point in quarterly margins for V&M as cost reductions help mitigate the impact of low volume.
Corporate expense declined by $14 million from year-ago levels and $12 million sequentially, reflecting our strategic shift to lower cost operating model, which began in early '14.
Despite the customary increase in working capital during the first quarter, the company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt to total cap ratio of 14%, which positions us well to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Cameron's CapEx totaled $89 million in the first quarter '15 as compared to $105 million in the first quarter '14. We acquired almost 4 million shares during the first quarter of '15. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were about 192 million. And we have 298 million remaining under our authorization.
Let me now turn to our '15 outlook. To put it very simply, not much has changed for overall '15 as compared to what we told you on our Investor Call in January. Even though we executed extremely well during the first quarter, we continue to see significant headwinds from the cyclical downturns being experienced. We expect to ship about 5.7 billion of our year-end backlog in '15, consistent with what we thought in January. As a reminder, we indicated our shorter-cycle business generated $4.4 billion of revenue in '14 and this will clearly come down in '15.
In our previous call, we indicated our overall consolidated margin could contract slightly less than 170 basis points. As we sit here today, we expect our focus on superior execution will result in a contraction in our consolidated operating income margin that is substantially less than we expected at the beginning of the year, although it will still will be down from '14 level.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments. Our Subsea segment, we now expect 2 billion of Subseas beginning of the year backlog is shipped in '15 as compared to 2.1 we expect at the start of the year. Quarterly income margin -- operating income margins for Subsea will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still believe the full year margin will be substantially higher than the 6.7 in '14 and could approach 10% for '15.
Now surface segment. We know expect 800 million of its beginning of the year backlog to ship in '15, and that was 750 million when we started the year. Now Surface is significantly exposed in North America, approximately 60% of its '14 revenues. This business has a strong international footprint and we think that combined with our strong market share in North America will help moderate the decline in revenue, which you might otherwise expect. 
Operating income margin will show some variability from quarter-to-quarter and will clearly be under pressure all year, but we will offset some of that pressure through further cost reductions. Still for the full year, operating income margin will be moderately below 17.7% we posted in '14, which is what we said on our January call.
Now Drilling segment. We now expect 2.1 billion of drillings beginning of backlog to ship in '15 and that is compared to 2 billion that we expected at the beginning of the year. However, as I mentioned earlier, we see more weakness that we had expected in our Surface business, which in '14, represented $963 million of revenues, as more land and Deepwater rigs are idled than we expected in January.
Operating income margins. Drilling will vary from quarter-to-quarter due to mix. The full year margin will comfortably exceed the 15.5% of '14. Stronger than we had expected at the beginning of the year due to the strength of our execution.
Our Valves & Measurement segment. 2015 shipments from beginning of the year backlog remains about $850 million. Operating income margin will remain under significant pressure all year and will bounce around from 1 quarter to the next. Full year operating income margin will be well below last year's level, but we think it will remain in double digits.
A few other '15 items to mention. As shown in this corporate expenses is shown in this segment presentation should approximate $110 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $130 million due to strategic restructuring of our corporate overhead functions. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Inter-segment revenue should approximate $200 million and the corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate will be roughly $50 million. Both of these numbers are higher than our previous forecasts as we continue to leverage cost segment marketing and manufacturing opportunities. Our operational tax rates should approximate 23% for the year, our CapEx should be between $300 million and $350 million and our noncontrolling interest should be about $50 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And so we're having very different discussions today than we ever have.

So it's been a pretty incredible ride. In fact, we used to provide valves to a lot of the regional service providers for that service back in 2010 and '11. And it became evident to us that customers really wanted to deal with the folks that are designing it, building it and servicing it day in, day out. And that's what this platform does. And it's more than just about its really timing and the 3 systems and the flow back systems that becomes a very efficient platform that customers are seeing with Cameron. Our measures is about 99% uptime in the performance of our equipment. That blows away anything else that is out there in a market. So you see in this downturn, we still penetrating market share, pricing pressure is there for sure and not every customer out there is going to appreciate maybe some of the efficiency gains that we can provide them.

Just to add to kind of the global context of Subsea, Brazil is off, right, and there's major issues in Brazil with the corruption and the management changes. And you're just not going to get the activity levels in Brazil that we've had historically. So that's probably the single biggest impairment. The lever project in Brazil will ultimately go forward. We hope to see very good -- the preliminary award for that in 2016. But absent of that, your Brazil just doesn't move forward with a whole lot and they were the big drivers of Subsea obviously. With that, excluding Brazil, we think the Gulf of Mexico moves forward at a reasonable pace. And then West Africa is really kind of anybody's guess in terms of when projects get sanctioned there but there are some really large ones.

It wouldn't be prudent for us to try and predict went that uptick is going to come because so much of that depends on our customers conviction to go back and open their pocketbooks to exploit both opportunities. And many of our customers are weighted to -- some have a heavier Deepwater opportunities that they're anxious to get back in play and we love our OneSubsea joint venture. We love the fact that it's helping our customers look differently with these projects and find ways to moving forward with lower cost and maybe higher return recoveries. And that's enabling -- I think there's going to be a huge enabler towards advancing that cycle recovery. So when you think of onshore, a lot of discussion around how quickly it can come back just because you can bring rigs back quicker, you can deploy assets and people quicker the onshore place -- the onshore U.S. has been an incredible platform for growth for us with our CAMSHALE package. It's extremely competitive. We don't feel we have any equals in that field. We're going to continue to push the idle along execution on that piece of the business. As Chuck said, our team has been a tremendous job of delivering the margin improvement but also managing the cost structure for the reality of where we're at. So those 2 platforms are going to really enable us to take advantage of both. But predicting the timing of which ones comes back first [indiscernible]"

Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results f",987,"Thanks, Scott. Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results for the first quarter 2015 included a sizable gain on the sale of our Centrifugal business and a charge for the impairment of goodwill on our Process Systems business. Chuck will provide the detail on those items.
Cameron executed well over the first 3 months of the year, and that helped to offset the seasonal first quarter weakness that we had expected. In particular, we saw accelerated benefits from our efforts to lower our fundamental cost structure and improve operational efficiency. Relative to year-ago quarter, both our Subsea and Drilling segments delivered sharp increases in operational income as they continue to successfully execute on their backlogs.
During the first quarter, operating income in our Surface segment remained relatively unchanged as cost reduction efforts and excellent execution mitigated the decline in orders for the segment's shorter-cycle business.
Operating income in our Valves & Measurement segment was down considerably, reflecting the impact of weak orders in 2014 and the destocking of distributor inventories, which I don't think comes as a surprise to anyone.
A big contributor to the company's first quarter results was the ongoing fundamental change in our cost structure that we began to implement in early 2014. This resulted in a significant decline in SG&A expense relative to the year-ago quarter. It's important to note that we are not talking about a short-term reaction to the downturn in the energy cycle, whether we are making systematic changes in the way we manage the entire Cameron enterprise at every level of the organization from the corporate office all the way through each of our business. So clearly, we saw the benefit of this in our first quarter, and we expect there will be more to come.
Now I like to offer some commentary on what we were seeing in the markets we serve, and I'll start with the onshore markets. The sharp decline in customer spending has impacted and will continue -- and continue to impact our Surface, Drilling and V&M segments this year. As expected and certainly as indicated by the declining rig counts, the industry-wide downturn in spending is hitting North America much harder than our international markets. And the result is predictable, as you saw in our Q1 orders for these 3 segments, which are down sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter.
That said, I will also add that our North America customer base is broad and mostly populated with IOCs, major independents and major drilling contractors, all of which we see as a positive in this environment. These strong customer relationships often enable Cameron to gain share in the downturn, which we have already seen several examples of.
And please remember that Cameron has also a very large international onshore presence, which is contracting at a slower rate in North America. In fact, some markets could even expand in 2014 and 2015, the Middle East in particular.
As for the offshore deepwater markets, our Subsea, Drilling and V&M segments are all exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing in offshore as well, with the slowdown posing more of an intermediate-term challenge to our Drilling and V&M businesses. We all know that capital spending in the drilling markets has dropped off sharply. However, if we're looking for a silver lining in this market, I would say that the scrapping of the older rigs is a positive for some form of eventual new-build recovery. I would also say that we are hopeful that the new orders in the services part of our Drilling business will continue to be a bit more resilient than the equipment side of the business, as was the case in the first quarter.
As for subsea projects, all of us in this business have been challenged by industry-wide pressure to improve the economics of deepwater developments. At OneSubsea, we are witnessing this pressure firsthand. Specifically, almost every prospective project we are tracking has gone through or is going through some sort of second or third round of analysis and reengineering to reduce both scope and price. Scott Rowe in his prepared remarks will cite a recent example of our success in this regard.
The good news is that the products and services we offer to our OneSubsea joint venture are targeted to help our customers achieve their objectives of improving the returns on their deepwater projects, specifically by focusing on reservoir productivity and optimization. That's part of the reason that Subsea delivered strong operating income and new orders in the first quarter.
Having said all of that, I must also say that the speed of the cyclical downturn continues to create significant uncertainty across all the markets we serve. This is especially true in relation to the shorter-cycle businesses, which include services. Although broadly speaking, we'd expect the percentage decline in order rate of services to be generally lower than for new equipment. And as you've heard us say before, we really don't think there's much to be gained by speculating about the depth and duration of this cycle. Instead, our focus will be to stay very close to our customers to ensure that we are advancing and investing in the most cost-efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our cost structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms.
Cameron has a very broad offering of products and services and a global footprint. This profile positions us to weather this downturn and emerge as an even stronger, formidable company over the longer term.
Now I would turn over the discussion over to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

That should come as a surprise to no one. The first quarter book-to-bill ratios were below 1 for all 4 segments. In particular, Subsea was 0.89, Surface was 0.83, Drilling was 0.37 and V&M was 0.91. Nevertheless, the bright spot in orders was in our Subsea segment, where the dollar value of orders was 30% above the year-ago quarter and 8% above the fourth quarter of 2014. This segment received orders for 23 subsea trees in total, which is more than double the order rate in Q1 of 2014. The strength of the orders was due in part to the booking of a sizable Subsea Systems order for the BP West Nile Delta towards labor development.
This is a contract valued at a couple hundred million dollars to supply subsea systems for a major gas project offshore Egypt. The order includes 10 large floor gas trees and related Subsea Systems. This project is a great example of customer-supplier collaboration. Specifically, OneSubsea work close with BP to optimize technology while significantly reducing costs, which allow the project to move forward. The project is being executed on a fast-track schedule, utilizing a standardized horizontal gas tree and control system, and first deliveries are expected in Q1 of 2016.
The project has 2 key characteristics that are typical of the kinds of subsea projects that we believe will continue to be sanctioned. First, it includes an element of standardization that substantially reduce the cost to the operator without compromising our commitment to improving our returns in this business. Second, it is driven by a compelling need to address local energy demand. As a result of this award and in consideration of other probable large awards that we are pursuing, we are reaffirming our previous guidance that new orders in our Subsea segment for 2015 will be at or above the levels reported in 2014.
Patience and persistence, in addition to technical excellence, is a virtue in this business. The value proposition of our OneSubsea business remains as strong as ever, as demonstrated by our latest award and by the progress reports we provided in March on 2 existing subsea processing projects that are enabling our customers to significantly increase the recoveries.
I have the privilege to be in the -- our Norway facility last month when we handed over the world's first subsea compression system to the Statoil senior management team. This system will ultimately increase the recovery rate of Gullfaks South Brent reservoir by more than 22 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Additionally, Chevron recently commissioned a subsea boosting system for the Jack and Saint Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico. This system is expected to yield an improvement of 10% to 30% recovery, which equates to 50 billion to 150 billion barrels of additional oil recovery -- sorry, 150 million barrels of additional oil recovery over the life of the project. OneSubsea now has more than 20 boosting projects in operation today, generating substantial value to our customers.
In our other 3 segments, orders were down on a sequential quarter basis and as compared to the first quarter of 2014. On a consolidated basis, orders for service-related activities have proved to be more resilient than equipment orders, with the percent decline less than half of the decline in the new orders.
Chuck will walk you through our guidance for each of the 4 segments, but I think it's worth reminding you of the ways that we are managing each of our businesses through the down cycle.
The Surface segment is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform on a relative basis due in part to its sizable presence in international markets, where activity levels have not decreased as much as in North America, and its CAMSHALE offering. As many of you know, CAMSHALE is a comprehensive and innovative pressure control system for shale deposits and which continues to set a high standard for the industry in driving efficiency and cost reduction. CAMSHALE also gives us a platform that can be easily levered to gain incremental business. The Surface segment performed better than our expectations in the first quarter, due in part to strong operations and cost control.
Our Subsea segment, and really OneSubsea specifically, continues to build on the Pore to Process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments, where an increase in production of even 5% or 10% can generate significant incremental returns. We continue to have meaningful discussions with operators as to how we can help them optimize cost and production. Our boosting technology is exceeding our expectations of reliability and improved recovery.
Our Drilling division will take the opportunity of the downturn to continue to invest in the build-out of our comprehensive deepwater drilling offering. We're in the process of delivering over 17 complete jack-up drilling equipment packages. Our focus in Drilling will be on conforming to evolving regulations, driving reliability and efficiency to new levels and standardizing our drilling offering.
Additionally, we are enhancing our service offering to provide the best, long-term support for drilling contractors.
Our Valves & Measurement business touches everything we do in Cameron in every segment of our business. Cameron valves are sold through distributors and direct to customers under 20 premier brand names and are recognized worldwide as offering unsurpassed quality and technical performance.
We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement performs to its full potential during this business cycle. This business is currently being impacted significantly by distributor destocking, but this business will respond quickly when the market in North America begins to stabilize.
Across the entire Cameron enterprise, we continue to be proactive in our approach to managing our relationships with our customers and in managing our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. Our segment performed -- our segments performed well during the first quarter while under significant pressure from the market and our customers. We fully expect to remain proactive in our cost measures and our ability to execute the downturn.
In this cycle, we are absolutely focused on driving technical solutions that will bring cost reduction and efficiencies to our customers. We announced a new Vice President of Marketing and Technology in the quarter, and we are committing more money to R&D this year than ever before. The activities and programs that we are implementing now will position Cameron for long-term success and outperformance throughout this cycle.Chuck?"
19839,284859562,793033,"Cameron International Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. The first was $538 million of after tax noncash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in o",1759,"Thanks, Scott. First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. The first was $538 million of after tax noncash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in our 10-K when we said the gap between the fair value determined under accounting guidance and the carrying value of this business was pretty narrow. As part of our routine annual review of goodwill, which occurred during the first quarter, we noted that the market outlook had gotten worse since year-end, which led us to conclude that an impairment charge was required under accounting rules, and so we recorded it. It is ironic somehow how accounting -- sometimes how accounting rules work, especially in this case for a business that had one of its best years ever in '14.
The second item was the $429 million of income from discontinued ops, primarily associated with the gain of the sale of our Compression businesses. In addition to these 2 items, we also had $18 million of after tax costs associated with downsizing the business and mark-to-market adjustments related to currency hedges. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.3 billion, essentially flat with the year-ago period, although clearly down from the fourth quarter. Our North American Surface and V&M businesses, which represents the majority of our shorter-cycle businesses, were down 12% from the first quarter of '14 and 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This rate of decline will accelerate somewhat as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.
Consolidated segment operating income margins were 13.8 for the quarter, down sequentially but up by about 200 basis points from the first quarter of '14. As Jack touched on, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and you saw that show up in our first quarter results with SG&A down 10% versus year-ago quarter.
Operating EPS was $0.91, which is well above the year-ago quarter, although particularly down from the record level of earnings in the fourth quarter of '14. We now expect this to be the high point of operating EPS for the year given the macro conditions we are facing.
Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '14. The decline of revenue is attributable to the relatively low level of '14 bookings. Operating income margin came in at 9%, more than double the year-ago quarter, due largely to execution excellence as well as higher price backlog. The margin declined sequentially as expected, reflecting the seasonality of first quarter revenues. We expect Q1 to represent the low point for revenues for the year. Q2 margin should come down a bit from Q1 levels due to mix before increasing in Q3 and 4.
Surface revenues were essentially flat in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the year-ago period but declined sequentially from what was a record level fourth quarter '14. Again, I don't think the sequential quarter revenue decline comes as a surprise to anyone. The North American business for Surface, which accounted for most of its shorter cycle businesses, was down 13% from the year-ago quarter and down 28% from the preceding quarter.
Surface operating income margin was 16.9% during the first quarter, which is flat with the year-ago quarter and down only moderately from the fourth quarter of '14. That's better than we had expected and reflects the success of this group in working very hard to mitigate the decline in orders and pricing pressure for this segment's shorter-cycle business. Q1 should represent the high point in quarterly revenues and margins for the year, as Surface's North American business begins to feel the full brunt of the activity decline in Q2.
Drilling revenues were higher than the somewhat depressed levels in the first quarter of '14 but clearly down on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting both the impact of a declining backlog for new equipment and a 16% decline in aftermarket revenues caused by the depressed level of North American and offshore rig activity.
As is the case with our Surface business, Q1 may very well represent the high point for the quarterly revenues for Drilling this year. Operating income margin was 18.6%, which is more than 800 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of '14. I want to recognize our Drilling team for the significant improvements they've made in execution over the past 12 months.
Q1 should be the high point in quarterly margins for this year, as the declining base of new equipment revenue and lower services revenue take their toll on margins.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the fourth quarter of '14. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the market as well as the relatively light orders for this segment in '14.
The North American business for V&M, which represents most of its shorter-cycle business, was down about 10% as compared to the preceding and year-ago quarters due to the weakness in North America. This decline will accelerate in coming quarters, as distributors continue to work off their excess inventories. However, as Scott mentioned, this will increase probably quicker than activity once that level of inventory is reached by our distributors.
Operating income margin in V&M was 10.5%, a sharp decline from the year-ago period and the preceding quarter. The decline in margin reflects the impact of weak orders in '14 and the destocking of distributor inventories. Hopefully, this is the low point in quarterly margins for V&M, as cost reductions help mitigate the impact of low volume.
Corporate expense declined by $14 million from year-ago levels and $12 million sequentially, reflecting our strategic shift to lower cost operating model, which began in early '14.
Despite the customary increase in working capital during the first quarter, the company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt to total cap ratio of 14%, which positions us well to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Cameron's CapEx totaled $89 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to $105 million in the first quarter of '14. We acquired almost 4 million shares during the first quarter of '15. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were about 192 million, and we have 298 million remaining under our authorization.
Let me now turn to our '15 outlook. To put it very simply, not much has changed for overall '15 as compared to what we told you on our Investor Call in January. Even though we executed extremely well during the first quarter, we continue to see significant headwinds from the cyclical downturn being experienced. We expect to ship about $5.7 billion of our year-end backlog in '15, consistent with what we thought in January. And as a reminder, we indicated our shorter-cycle business generated $4.4 billion of revenue in '14, and this will clearly come down in '15.
On our previous call, we indicated our overall consolidated margin could contract slightly less than 170 basis points. As we sit here today, we expect our focus on superior execution will result in a contraction in our consolidated operating income margin that is substantially less than we expected at the beginning of the year, although it still will be down from '14's level.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments. In our Subsea segment, we now expect $2 billion of Subsea's ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15 as compared to $2.1 billion we expected at the start of the year. Quarterly income -- operating income margins for Subsea will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still believe the full year margin will be substantially higher than the 6.7% in '14 and could approach 10% for '15.
In our Surface segment, we now expect $800 million of its ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15, and that was $750 million when we started the year. While Surface is significantly exposed in North America, approximately 60% of its '14 revenues, this business has a strong international footprint. And we think that, combined with our strong market share in North America, will help moderate the decline in revenue, as you might otherwise expect.
Operating income margin will show some variability from quarter-to-quarter and will clearly be under pressure all year, but we will offset some of that pressure through further cost reductions. Still, for the full year, operating income margin will be moderately below the 17.7% we posted in '14, which is what we said on our January call.
In our Drilling segment, we now expect $2.1 billion of Drilling's ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15, and that is compared to $2 billion that we expected at the beginning of the year. However, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more weakness than we had expected in our service business, which in '14 represented $963 million of revenues, as more land and deepwater rigs are idled than we expected in January.
Operating income margins for Drilling will vary from quarter-to-quarter due to mix. But the full year margin will comfortably exceed the 15.5% of '14, stronger than we had expected at the beginning of the year due to the strength of our execution.
In our Valves & Measurement segment, 2015 shipments from the ""beginning of the year"" backlog remains about $850 million. Operating income margin will remain under significant pressure all year and will bounce around from one quarter to the next. Full year operating income margin will be well below last year's level, but we think it will remain in double digits.
A few other '15 items to mention. As shown in this -- corporate expenses, as shown in this segment presentation, should approximate $110 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $130 million due to the strategic restructuring of our corporate overhead functions. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Intersegment revenue should approximate $200 million, and the corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Both of these numbers are higher than our previous forecast, as we continue to leverage cost segment marketing and manufacturing opportunities. Our operational tax rates should approximate 23% for the year, our CapEx should be between $300 million and $350 million and our noncontrolling interest should be about $50 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And it became evident to us that customers really wanted to deal with the folks that are designing it, building it and servicing it day in, day out. And that's what this platform does. And it's more than just the valves. It's really tying in the tree systems and the flowback systems that becomes a very efficient platform that customers are seeing with Cameron. Our measure is about 99% uptime in the performance of our equipment. That blows away anything else that is out there in the market. So you see in this downturn, we're still penetrating market share.

And as Jack said in his commentary, unfortunately, right now, every operator wants to have a second and third look at price. And as the industry continues to give them price reductions, they continue to ask more. And so I think as this kind of plays out a little bit, operators get comfortable that they do have the lowest possible costs and then push forward some of their deepwater programs. Just to add to kind of the global context of subsea. Brazil is off, right? And there's major issues in Brazil with the corruption and the management changes. And you're just not going to get the activity levels in Brazil that we've had historically. And so that's probably the single biggest impairment. The Libra project in Brazil will ultimately go forward. We hope to see very -- the preliminary award for that in 2016. But absent of that, Brazil just doesn't move forward with a whole lot and they were the big drivers of subsea obviously. With that, excluding Brazil, we think the Gulf of Mexico moves forward at a reasonable pace. And then West Africa really is kind of anybody's guess in terms of when projects get sanctioned there, but there are some really large ones. That, again, we'll see significant cost decreases as they continue to access supply base for reductions there and work through that standardization effort."

We love the fact that it's helping our customers look differently at these projects and find ways to move them forward with lower cost and maybe higher return recoveries. And that's enabling -- I think it's going to be a huge enabler towards advancing that cycle recovery. So when you think of onshore, a lot of discussion around how quickly it can come back just because you can bring rigs back quicker, you can deploy assets and people quicker to the onshore plays. The onshore U.S. has been an incredible platform for growth for us with our CAMSHALE package. It's extremely competitive. We don't feel we have any equals in that field.

Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results f",987,"Thanks, Scott. Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results for the first quarter 2015 included a sizable gain on the sale of our Centrifugal business and a charge for the impairment of goodwill on our Process Systems business. Chuck will provide the detail on those items.
Cameron executed well over the first 3 months of the year, and that helped to offset the seasonal first quarter weakness that we had expected. In particular, we saw accelerated benefits from our efforts to lower our fundamental cost structure and improve operational efficiency. Relative to year-ago quarter, both our Subsea and Drilling segments delivered sharp increases in operational income as they continue to successfully execute on their backlogs.
During the first quarter, operating income in our Surface segment remained relatively unchanged as cost reduction efforts and excellent execution mitigated the decline in orders for the segment's shorter-cycle business.
Operating income in our Valves & Measurement segment was down considerably, reflecting the impact of weak orders in 2014 and the destocking of distributor inventories, which I don't think comes as a surprise to anyone.
A big contributor to the company's first quarter results was the ongoing fundamental change in our cost structure that we began to implement in early 2014. This resulted in a significant decline in SG&A expense relative to the year-ago quarter. It's important to note that we are not talking about a short-term reaction to the downturn in the energy cycle. Rather, we are making systematic changes in the way we manage the entire Cameron enterprise at every level of the organization, from the corporate office all the way through each of our business. So clearly, we saw the benefit of this in our first quarter, and we expect there will be more to come.
Now I like to offer some commentary on what we were seeing in the markets we serve, and I'll start with the onshore markets. The sharp decline in customer spending has impacted and will continue -- and continue to impact our Surface, Drilling and V&M segments this year. As expected and certainly as indicated by the declining rig counts, the industry-wide downturn in spending is hitting North America much harder than our international markets. And the result is predictable, as you saw in our Q1 orders for these 3 segments, which are down sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter.
That said, I will also add that our North America customer base is broad and mostly populated with IOCs, major independents and major drilling contractors, all of which we see as a positive in this environment. These strong customer relationships often enable Cameron to gain share in a downturn, which we have already seen several examples of.
And please remember that Cameron has also a very large international onshore presence, which is contracting at a slower rate than North America. In fact, some markets could even expand in 2014 -- in 2015; the Middle East in particular.
As for the offshore deepwater markets, our Subsea, Drilling and V&M segments are all exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing in offshore as well, with the slowdown posing more of an intermediate-term challenge to our Drilling and V&M businesses. We all know that capital spending in the drilling markets has dropped off sharply. However, if we're looking for a silver lining in this market, I would say that the scrapping of the older rigs is a positive for some form of eventual new-build recovery. I would also say that we are hopeful that the new orders in the services part of our Drilling business will continue to be a bit more resilient than the equipment side of the business, as was the case in the first quarter.
As for subsea projects, all of us in this business have been challenged by industry-wide pressure to improve the economics of deepwater developments. At OneSubsea, we are witnessing this pressure firsthand. Specifically, almost every prospective project we are tracking has gone through or is going through some sort of second or third round of analysis and reengineering to reduce both scope and price. Scott Rowe in his prepared remarks will cite a recent example of our success in this regard.
The good news is that the products and services we offer through our OneSubsea joint venture are targeted to help our customers achieve their objectives of improving the returns on their deepwater projects, specifically by focusing on reservoir productivity and optimization. That's part of the reason that Subsea delivered strong operating income and new orders in the first quarter.
Having said all of that, I must also say that the speed of the cyclical downturn continues to create significant uncertainty across all the markets we serve. This is especially true in relation to the shorter-cycle businesses, which include services. Although broadly speaking, we'd expect the percentage decline in order rate of services to be generally lower than for new equipment. And as you've heard us say before, we really don't think there's much to be gained by speculating about the depth and duration of this cycle. Instead, our focus will be to stay very close to our customers to ensure that we are advancing and investing in the most cost-efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our cost structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms.
Cameron has a very broad offering of products and services and a global footprint. This profile positions us to weather this downturn and emerge as an even stronger, formidable company over the longer term.
Now I would turn the discussion over to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

Cameron's new orders and backlog for the first quarter of 2015 declined sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the reduced activity levels across the industry that Jack just outlined for you.

Cameron's new orders and backlog for the first quarter of 2015 declined sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the reduced activity levels across the industry that Jack just outlined for you. That should come as a surprise to no one. The first quarter book-to-bill ratios were below 1 for all 4 segments. In particular, Subsea was 0.89, Surface was 0.83, Drilling was 0.37 and V&M was 0.91. Nevertheless, the bright spot in orders was in our Subsea segment, where the dollar value of orders was 30% above the year-ago quarter and 8% above the fourth quarter of 2014. This segment received orders for 23 subsea trees in total, which is more than double the order rate in Q1 of 2014. The strength of the orders was due in part to the booking of a sizable Subsea Systems order for the BP West Nile Delta Taurus Libra development.
This is a contract valued at a couple hundred million dollars to supply subsea systems for a major gas project, offshore, Egypt. The order includes 10 large floor gas trees and related Subsea Systems. This project is a great example of customer-supplier collaboration. Specifically, OneSubsea work close with BP to optimize technology while significantly reducing costs, which allowed the project to move forward. The project is being executed on a fast-track schedule, utilizing a standardized horizontal gas tree and control system, and first deliveries are expected in Q1 of 2016.
The project has two key characteristics that are typical of the kinds of subsea projects that we believe will continue to be sanctioned. First, it includes an element of standardization that substantially reduce the cost to the operator without compromising our commitment to improving our returns in this business. Second, it is driven by a compelling need to address local energy demand. As a result of this award and in consideration of other probable large awards that we are pursuing, we are reaffirming our previous guidance that new orders in our Subsea segment for 2015 will be at or above the levels reported in 2014.
Patience and persistence, in addition to technical excellence, is a virtue in this business. The value proposition of our OneSubsea business remains as strong as ever, as demonstrated by our latest award and by the progress reports we provided in March on two existing subsea processing projects that are enabling our customers to significantly increase the recoveries.
I have the privilege to be in the -- our Norway facility last month when we handed over the world's first subsea compression system to the Statoil senior management team. This system will ultimately increase the recovery rate of Gullfaks South Brent reservoir by more than 22 million barrels of oil equivalents.
Additionally, Chevron recently commissioned a subsea boosting system for the Jack and St. Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico. This system is expected to yield an improvement of 10% to 30% recovery, which equates to 50 billion to 150 billion barrels of additional oil recovery -- sorry, 150 million barrels of additional oil recovery over the life of the project. OneSubsea now has more than 20 boosting projects in operation today, generating substantial value to our customers.
In our other 3 segments, orders were down on a sequential quarter basis and as compared to the first quarter of 2014. On a consolidated basis, orders for service-related activities have proved to be more resilient than equipment orders, with the percent decline less than half of the decline in the new orders.
Chuck will walk you through our guidance for each of the 4 segments, but I think it's worth reminding you of the ways that we are managing each of our businesses through the down cycle.
The Surface segment is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform on a relative basis due in part to its sizable presence in international markets, where activity levels have not decreased as much as in North America, and its CAMSHALE offering. As many of you know, CAMSHALE is a comprehensive and innovative pressure control system for shale deposits and which continues to set a high standard for the industry in driving efficiency and cost reduction. CAMSHALE also gives us a platform that can be easily levered to gain incremental business. The Surface segment performed better than our expectations in the first quarter, due in part to strong operations and cost control.
Our Subsea segment, and really OneSubsea specifically, continues to build on the Pore to Process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments, where an increase in production of even 5% or 10% can generate significant incremental returns. We continue to have meaningful discussions with operators as to how we can help them optimize cost and production. Our boosting technology is exceeding our expectations of reliability and improved recovery.
Our Drilling division will take the opportunity of the downturn to continue to invest in the build-out of our comprehensive deepwater drilling offering. We're in the process of delivering over 17 complete jack-up drilling equipment packages. Our focus in Drilling will be on conforming to evolving regulations, driving reliability and efficiency to new levels and standardizing our drilling offering.
Additionally, we are enhancing our service offering to provide the best, long-term support for drilling contractors.
Our Valves & Measurement business touches everything we do at Cameron in every segment of our business. Cameron valves are sold through distributors and direct to customers under 20 premier brand names and are recognized worldwide as offering unsurpassed quality and technical performance.
We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement performs to its full potential during this business cycle. This business is currently being impacted significantly by distributor destocking, but this business will respond quickly when the market in North America begins to stabilize.
Across the entire Cameron enterprise, we continue to be proactive in our approach to managing our relationships with our customers and in managing our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. Our segment performed -- our segments performed well during the first quarter while under significant pressure from the market and our customers. We fully expect to remain proactive in our cost measures and our ability to execute in the downturn.
In this cycle, we are absolutely focused on driving technical solutions that will bring cost reduction and efficiencies to our customers. We announced a new Vice President of Marketing and Technology in the quarter, and we are committing more money to R&D this year than ever before. The activities and programs that we are implementing now will position Cameron for long-term success and outperformance throughout this cycle. Chuck?"

We've previously flagged this issue in o",1759,"Thanks, Scott. First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. The first was $538 million of after tax noncash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in our 10-K when we said the gap between the fair value determined under accounting guidance and the carrying value of this business was pretty narrow. As part of our routine annual review of goodwill, which occurred during the first quarter, we noted that the market outlook had gotten worse since year-end, which led us to conclude that an impairment charge was required under accounting rules, and so we recorded it. It is ironic somehow how accounting -- sometimes how accounting rules work, especially in this case for a business that had one of its best years ever in '14.
The second item was the $429 million of income from discontinued ops, primarily associated with the gain of the sale of our Compression businesses. In addition to these 2 items, we also had $18 million of after tax costs associated with downsizing the business and mark-to-market adjustments related to currency hedges. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.3 billion, essentially flat with the year-ago period, although clearly down from the fourth quarter. Our North American Surface and V&M businesses, which represents the majority of our shorter-cycle businesses, were down 12% from the first quarter of '14 and 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This rate of decline will accelerate somewhat as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.
Consolidated segment operating income margins were 13.8 for the quarter, down sequentially but up by about 200 basis points from the first quarter of '14. As Jack touched on, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and you saw that show up in our first quarter results with SG&A down 10% versus year-ago quarter.
Operating EPS was $0.91, which is well above the year-ago quarter, although particularly down from the record level of earnings in the fourth quarter of '14. We now expect this to be the high point of operating EPS for the year given the macro conditions we are facing.
Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '14. The decline of revenue is attributable to the relatively low level of '14 bookings. Operating income margin came in at 9%, more than double the year-ago quarter, due largely to execution excellence as well as higher price backlog. The margin declined sequentially as expected, reflecting the seasonality of first quarter revenues. We expect Q1 to represent the low point for revenues for the year. Q2 margin should come down a bit from Q1 levels due to mix before increasing in Q3 and 4.
Surface revenues were essentially flat in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the year-ago period but declined sequentially from what was a record level fourth quarter of '14. Again, I don't think the sequential quarter revenue decline comes as a surprise to anyone. The North American business for Surface, which accounted for most of its shorter cycle businesses, was down 13% from the year-ago quarter and down 28% from the preceding quarter.
Surface operating income margin was 16.9% during the first quarter, which is flat with the year-ago quarter and down only moderately from the fourth quarter of '14. That's better than we had expected and reflects the success of this group in working very hard to mitigate the decline in orders and pricing pressure for this segment's shorter-cycle business. Q1 should represent the high point in quarterly revenues and margins for the year, as Surface's North American business begins to feel the full brunt of the activity decline in Q2.
Drilling revenues were higher than the somewhat depressed levels in the first quarter of '14 but clearly down on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting both the impact of a declining backlog for new equipment and a 16% decline in aftermarket revenues caused by the depressed level of North American and offshore rig activity.
As is the case with our Surface business, Q1 may very well represent the high point for the quarterly revenues for Drilling this year. Operating income margin was 18.6%, which is more than 800 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of '14. I want to recognize our Drilling team for the significant improvements they've made in execution over the past 12 months.
Q1 should be the high point in quarterly margins for this year, as the declining base of new equipment revenue and lower services revenue take their toll on margins.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the fourth quarter of '14. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the market as well as the relatively light orders for this segment in '14.
The North American business for V&M, which represents most of its shorter-cycle business, was down about 10% as compared to the preceding and year-ago quarters due to the weakness in North America. This decline will accelerate in coming quarters, as distributors continue to work off their excess inventories. However, as Scott mentioned, this will increase probably quicker than activity once that level of inventory is reached by our distributors.
Operating income margin in V&M was 10.5%, a sharp decline from the year-ago period and the preceding quarter. The decline in margin reflects the impact of weak orders in '14 and the destocking of distributor inventories. Hopefully, this is the low point in quarterly margins for V&M, as cost reductions help mitigate the impact of low volume.
Corporate expense declined by $14 million from year-ago levels and $12 million sequentially, reflecting our strategic shift to lower cost operating model, which began in early '14.
Despite the customary increase in working capital during the first quarter, the company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt to total cap ratio of 14%, which positions us well to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Cameron's CapEx totaled $89 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to $105 million in the first quarter of '14. We acquired almost 4 million shares during the first quarter of '15. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were about 192 million, and we have 298 million remaining under our authorization.
Let me now turn to our '15 outlook. To put it very simply, not much has changed for overall '15 as compared to what we told you on our Investor Call in January. Even though we executed extremely well during the first quarter, we continue to see significant headwinds from the cyclical downturn being experienced. We expect to ship about $5.7 billion of our year-end backlog in '15, consistent with what we thought in January. And as a reminder, we indicated our shorter-cycle business generated $4.4 billion of revenue in '14, and this will clearly come down in '15.
On our previous call, we indicated our overall consolidated margin could contract slightly less than 170 basis points. As we sit here today, we expect our focus on superior execution will result in a contraction in our consolidated operating income margin that is substantially less than we expected at the beginning of the year, although it still will be down from '14's level.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments. In our Subsea segment, we now expect $2 billion of Subsea's ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15 as compared to $2.1 billion we expected at the start of the year. Quarterly income -- operating income margins for Subsea will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still believe the full year margin will be substantially higher than the 6.7% in '14 and could approach 10% for '15.
In our Surface segment, we now expect $800 million of its ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15, and that was $750 million when we started the year. While Surface is significantly exposed in North America, approximately 60% of its '14 revenues, this business has a strong international footprint. And we think that, combined with our strong market share in North America, will help moderate the decline in revenue, as you might otherwise expect.
Operating income margin will show some variability from quarter-to-quarter and will clearly be under pressure all year, but we will offset some of that pressure through further cost reductions. Still, for the full year, operating income margin will be moderately below the 17.7% we posted in '14, which is what we said on our January call.
In our Drilling segment, we now expect $2.1 billion of Drilling's ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15, and that is compared to $2 billion that we expected at the beginning of the year. However, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more weakness than we had expected in our service business, which in '14 represented $963 million of revenues, as more land and deepwater rigs are idled than we expected in January.
Operating income margins for Drilling will vary from quarter-to-quarter due to mix. But the full year margin will comfortably exceed the 15.5% of '14, stronger than we had expected at the beginning of the year due to the strength of our execution.
In our Valves & Measurement segment, 2015 shipments from the ""beginning of the year"" backlog remains about $850 million. Operating income margin will remain under significant pressure all year and will bounce around from one quarter to the next. Full year operating income margin will be well below last year's level, but we think it will remain in double digits.
A few other '15 items to mention. As shown in this -- corporate expenses, as shown in this segment presentation, should approximate $110 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $130 million due to the strategic restructuring of our corporate overhead functions. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Intersegment revenue should approximate $200 million, and the corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Both of these numbers are higher than our previous forecast, as we continue to leverage cross-segment marketing and manufacturing opportunities. Our operational tax rates should approximate 23% for the year, our CapEx should be between $300 million and $350 million and our noncontrolling interest should be about $50 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Today, in North America, our share of that business and really around the pressure control equipment for the frac-ing operations; tree systems, frac trees, frac manifolds and frac valves is about 40%. So it's been a pretty incredible ride. In fact, we used to provide valves to a lot of the regional service providers for that service back in 2010 and '11. And it became evident to us that customers really wanted to deal with the folks that are designing it, building it and servicing it day in, day out. And that's what this platform does. And it's more than just the valves. It's really tying in the tree systems and the flow back systems that becomes a very efficient platform that customers are seeing with Cameron. Our measure is about 99% uptime in the performance of our equipment. That blows away anything else that is out there in the market. So you see in this downturn, we're still penetrating market share. Pricing pressure is there for sure. Not every customer out there is going to appreciate maybe some of the efficiency gains that we can provide them.

Just to add to kind of the global context of subsea. Brazil is off, right? And there's major issues in Brazil with the corruption and the management changes. And you're just not going to get the activity levels in Brazil that we've had historically. And so that's probably the single biggest impairment. The Libra project in Brazil will ultimately go forward. We hope to see very -- the preliminary award for that in 2016. But absent of that, Brazil just doesn't move forward with a whole lot and they were the big drivers of subsea obviously. With that, excluding Brazil, we think the Gulf of Mexico moves forward at a reasonable pace. And then West Africa really is kind of anybody's guess in terms of when projects get sanctioned there, but there are some really large ones. That, again, we'll see significant cost decreases as they continue to ask the supply base for reductions there and work through that standardization effort."

We love the fact that it's helping our customers look differently at these projects and find ways to move them forward with lower cost and maybe higher return recoveries. And that's enabling -- I think it's going to be a huge enabler towards advancing that cycle recovery. So when you think of onshore, a lot of discussion around how quickly it can come back just because you can bring rigs back quicker, you can deploy assets and people quicker to the onshore plays. The onshore U.S. has been an incredible platform for growth for us with our CAMSHALE package. It's extremely competitive. We don't feel we have any equals in that field. We are going to continue to push the pedal on execution in that piece of the business. As Chuck said, our team has done a tremendous job of delivering the margin improvement but also managing the cost structure for the reality of where we're at.

Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results f",987,"Thanks, Scott. Cameron today reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding the items identified in our press release, of $0.91 for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 30% as compared to the $0.70 we earned in the first quarter 2014. Results for the first quarter 2015 included a sizable gain on the sale of our Centrifugal business and a charge for the impairment of goodwill on our Process Systems business. Chuck will provide the detail on those items.
Cameron executed well over the first 3 months of the year, and that helped to offset the seasonal first quarter weakness that we had expected. In particular, we saw accelerated benefits from our efforts to lower our fundamental cost structure and improve operational efficiency. Relative to year-ago quarter, both our Subsea and Drilling segments delivered sharp increases in operational income as they continue to successfully execute on their backlogs.
During the first quarter, operating income in our Surface segment remained relatively unchanged as cost reduction efforts and excellent execution mitigated the decline in orders for the segment's shorter-cycle business.
Operating income in our Valves & Measurement segment was down considerably, reflecting the impact of weak orders in 2014 and the destocking of distributor inventories, which I don't think comes as a surprise to anyone.
A big contributor to the company's first quarter results was the ongoing fundamental change in our cost structure that we began to implement in early 2014. This resulted in a significant decline in SG&A expense relative to the year-ago quarter. It's important to note that we are not talking about a short-term reaction to the downturn in the energy cycle. Rather, we are making systematic changes in the way we manage the entire Cameron enterprise at every level of the organization, from the corporate office all the way through each of our business. So clearly, we saw the benefit of this in our first quarter, and we expect there will be more to come.
Now I like to offer some commentary on what we were seeing in the markets we serve, and I'll start with the onshore markets. The sharp decline in customer spending has impacted and will continue -- and continue to impact our Surface, Drilling and V&M segments this year. As expected and certainly as indicated by the declining rig counts, the industry-wide downturn in spending is hitting North America much harder than our international markets. And the result is predictable, as you saw in our Q1 orders for these 3 segments, which are down sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter.
That said, I will also add that our North America customer base is broad and mostly populated with IOCs, major independents and major drilling contractors, all of which we see as a positive in this environment. These strong customer relationships often enable Cameron to gain share in a downturn, which we have already seen several examples of.
And please remember that Cameron has also a very large international onshore presence, which is contracting at a slower rate than North America. In fact, some markets could even expand in 2014 -- in 2015; the Middle East in particular.
As for the offshore deepwater markets, our Subsea, Drilling and V&M segments are all exposed to the pullback in spending we are witnessing in offshore as well, with the slowdown posing more of an intermediate-term challenge to our Drilling and V&M businesses. We all know that capital spending in the drilling markets has dropped off sharply. However, if we're looking for a silver lining in this market, I would say that the scrapping of the older rigs is a positive for some form of eventual new-build recovery. I would also say that we are hopeful that the new orders in the services part of our Drilling business will continue to be a bit more resilient than the equipment side of the business, as was the case in the first quarter.
As for subsea projects, all of us in this business have been challenged by industry-wide pressure to improve the economics of deepwater developments. At OneSubsea, we are witnessing this pressure firsthand. Specifically, almost every prospective project we are tracking has gone through or is going through some sort of second or third round of analysis and reengineering to reduce both scope and price. Scott Rowe in his prepared remarks will cite a recent example of our success in this regard.
The good news is that the products and services we offer through our OneSubsea joint venture are targeted to help our customers achieve their objectives of improving the returns on their deepwater projects, specifically by focusing on reservoir productivity and optimization. That's part of the reason that Subsea delivered strong operating income and new orders in the first quarter.
Having said all of that, I must also say that the speed of the cyclical downturn continues to create significant uncertainty across all the markets we serve. This is especially true in relation to the shorter-cycle businesses, which include services. Although broadly speaking, we'd expect the percentage decline in order rate of services to be generally lower than for new equipment. And as you've heard us say before, we really don't think there's much to be gained by speculating about the depth and duration of this cycle. Instead, our focus will be to stay very close to our customers to ensure that we are advancing and investing in the most cost-efficient solutions for their operations, not compromise on our commitment to service and execution excellence, aggressively manage our cost structure to the reality of the business and be opportunistic towards expanding our core platforms.
Cameron has a very broad offering of products and services and a global footprint. This profile positions us to weather this downturn and emerge as an even stronger, formidable company over the longer term.
Now I would turn the discussion over to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer."

Cameron's new orders and backlog for the first quarter of 2015 declined sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the reduced activity levels across the industry that Jack just outlined for you. That should come as a surprise to no one. The first quarter book-to-bill ratios were below 1 for all 4 segments. In particular, Subsea was 0.89, Surface was 0.83, Drilling was 0.37 and V&M was 0.91. Nevertheless, the bright spot in orders was in our Subsea segment, where the dollar value of orders was 30% above the year-ago quarter and 8% above the fourth quarter of 2014. This segment received orders for 23 subsea trees in total, which is more than double the order rate in Q1 of 2014. The strength of the orders was due in part to the booking of a sizable Subsea Systems order for the BP West Nile Delta Taurus Libra development.
This is a contract valued at a couple hundred million dollars to supply subsea systems for a major gas project, offshore, Egypt. The order includes 10 large floor gas trees and related Subsea Systems. This project is a great example of customer-supplier collaboration. Specifically, OneSubsea work close with BP to optimize technology while significantly reducing costs, which allowed the project to move forward. The project is being executed on a fast-track schedule, utilizing a standardized horizontal gas tree and control system, and first deliveries are expected in Q1 of 2016.
The project has 2 key characteristics that are typical of the kinds of subsea projects that we believe will continue to be sanctioned. First, it includes an element of standardization that substantially reduce the cost to the operator without compromising our commitment to improving our returns in this business. Second, it is driven by a compelling need to address local energy demand. As a result of this award and in consideration of other probable large awards that we are pursuing, we are reaffirming our previous guidance that new orders in our Subsea segment for 2015 will be at or above the levels reported in 2014.
Patience and persistence, in addition to technical excellence, is a virtue in this business. The value proposition of our OneSubsea business remains as strong as ever, as demonstrated by our latest award and by the progress reports we provided in March on 2 existing subsea processing projects that are enabling our customers to significantly increase the recoveries.
I have the privilege to be in the -- our Norway facility last month when we handed over the world's first subsea compression system to the Statoil senior management team. This system will ultimately increase the recovery rate of Gullfaks South Brent reservoir by more than 22 million barrels of oil equivalents.
Additionally, Chevron recently commissioned a subsea boosting system for the Jack and St. Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico. This system is expected to yield an improvement of 10% to 30% recovery, which equates to 50 billion to 150 billion barrels of additional oil recovery -- sorry, 150 million barrels of additional oil recovery over the life of the project. OneSubsea now has more than 20 boosting projects in operation today, generating substantial value to our customers.
In our other 3 segments, orders were down on a sequential quarter basis and as compared to the first quarter of 2014. On a consolidated basis, orders for service-related activities have proved to be more resilient than equipment orders, with the percent decline less than half of the decline in the new orders.
Chuck will walk you through our guidance for each of the 4 segments, but I think it's worth reminding you of the ways that we are managing each of our businesses through the down cycle.
The Surface segment is well positioned as the market leader to continue to outperform on a relative basis due in part to its sizable presence in international markets, where activity levels have not decreased as much as in North America, and its CAMSHALE offering. As many of you know, CAMSHALE is a comprehensive and innovative pressure control system for shale deposits and which continues to set a high standard for the industry in driving efficiency and cost reduction. CAMSHALE also gives us a platform that can be easily levered to gain incremental business. The Surface segment performed better than our expectations in the first quarter, due in part to strong operations and cost control.
Our Subsea segment, and really OneSubsea specifically, continues to build on the Pore to Process approach that will help operators improve their overall recovery in their deepwater developments, where an increase in production of even 5% or 10% can generate significant incremental returns. We continue to have meaningful discussions with operators as to how we can help them optimize cost and production. Our boosting technology is exceeding our expectations of reliability and improved recovery.
Our Drilling division will take the opportunity of the downturn to continue to invest in the build-out of our comprehensive deepwater drilling offering. We're in the process of delivering over 17 complete jack-up drilling equipment packages. Our focus in Drilling will be on conforming to evolving regulations, driving reliability and efficiency to new levels and standardizing our drilling offering.
Additionally, we are enhancing our service offering to provide the best, long-term support for drilling contractors.
Our Valves & Measurement business touches everything we do at Cameron in every segment of our business. Cameron valves are sold through distributors and direct to customers under 20 premier brand names and are recognized worldwide as offering unsurpassed quality and technical performance.
We will leverage the breadth and knowledge within the enterprise to ensure that Valves & Measurement performs to its full potential during this business cycle. This business is currently being impacted significantly by distributor destocking, but this business will respond quickly when the market in North America begins to stabilize.
Across the entire Cameron enterprise, we continue to be proactive in our approach to managing our relationships with our customers and in managing our cost structure. We have a highly engaged team and we have a relentless drive towards excellence. Our segment performed -- our segments performed well during the first quarter while under significant pressure from the market and our customers. We fully expect to remain proactive in our cost measures and our ability to execute in the downturn.
In this cycle, we are absolutely focused on driving technical solutions that will bring cost reduction and efficiencies to our customers. We announced a new Vice President of Marketing and Technology in the quarter, and we are committing more money to R&D this year than ever before. The activities and programs that we are implementing now will position Cameron for long-term success and outperformance throughout this cycle. Chuck?"

First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. The first was $538 million of after tax noncash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in o",1759,"Thanks, Scott. First, just a word about the unusual items that impacted the quarter. The first was $538 million of after tax noncash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill in our Process Systems business. We've previously flagged this issue in our 10-K when we said the gap between the fair value determined under accounting guidance and the carrying value of this business was pretty narrow. As part of our routine annual review of goodwill, which occurred during the first quarter, we noted that the market outlook had gotten worse since year-end, which led us to conclude that an impairment charge was required under accounting rules, and so we recorded it. It is ironic somehow how accounting -- sometimes how accounting rules work, especially in this case for a business that had one of its best years ever in '14.
The second item was the $429 million of income from discontinued ops, primarily associated with the gain of the sale of our Compression businesses. In addition to these 2 items, we also had $18 million of after tax costs associated with downsizing the business and mark-to-market adjustments related to currency hedges. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.3 billion, essentially flat with the year-ago period, although clearly down from the fourth quarter. Our North American Surface and V&M businesses, which represents the majority of our shorter-cycle businesses, were down 12% from the first quarter of '14 and 19% from the fourth quarter of '14. This rate of decline will accelerate somewhat as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.
Consolidated segment operating income margins were 13.8 for the quarter, down sequentially but up by about 200 basis points from the first quarter of '14. As Jack touched on, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and you saw that show up in our first quarter results with SG&A down 10% versus year-ago quarter.
Operating EPS was $0.91, which is well above the year-ago quarter, although particularly down from the record level of earnings in the fourth quarter of '14. We now expect this to be the high point of operating EPS for the year given the macro conditions we are facing.
Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '14. The decline of revenue is attributable to the relatively low level of '14 bookings. Operating income margin came in at 9%, more than double the year-ago quarter, due largely to execution excellence as well as higher price backlog. The margin declined sequentially as expected, reflecting the seasonality of first quarter revenues. We expect Q1 to represent the low point for revenues for the year. Q2 margin should come down a bit from Q1 levels due to mix before increasing in Q3 and 4.
Surface revenues were essentially flat in the first quarter of '15 as compared to the year-ago period but declined sequentially from what was a record level fourth quarter of '14. Again, I don't think the sequential quarter revenue decline comes as a surprise to anyone. The North American business for Surface, which accounted for most of its shorter cycle businesses, was down 13% from the year-ago quarter and down 28% from the preceding quarter.
Surface operating income margin was 16.9% during the first quarter, which is flat with the year-ago quarter and down only moderately from the fourth quarter of '14. That's better than we had expected and reflects the success of this group in working very hard to mitigate the decline in orders and pricing pressure for this segment's shorter-cycle business. Q1 should represent the high point in quarterly revenues and margins for the year, as Surface's North American business begins to feel the full brunt of the activity decline in Q2.
Drilling revenues were higher than the somewhat depressed levels in the first quarter of '14 but clearly down on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting both the impact of a declining backlog for new equipment and a 16% decline in aftermarket revenues caused by the depressed level of North American and offshore rig activity.
As is the case with our Surface business, Q1 may very well represent the high point for the quarterly revenues for Drilling this year. Operating income margin was 18.6%, which is more than 800 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of '14. I want to recognize our Drilling team for the significant improvements they've made in execution over the past 12 months.
Q1 should be the high point in quarterly margins for this year, as the declining base of new equipment revenue and lower services revenue take their toll on margins.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the fourth quarter of '14. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the market as well as the relatively light orders for this segment in '14.
The North American business for V&M, which represents most of its shorter-cycle business, was down about 10% as compared to the preceding and year-ago quarters due to the weakness in North America. This decline will accelerate in coming quarters, as distributors continue to work off their excess inventories. However, as Scott mentioned, this will increase probably quicker than activity once that level of inventory is reached by our distributors.
Operating income margin in V&M was 10.5%, a sharp decline from the year-ago period and the preceding quarter. The decline in margin reflects the impact of weak orders in '14 and the destocking of distributor inventories. Hopefully, this is the low point in quarterly margins for V&M, as cost reductions help mitigate the impact of low volume.
Corporate expense declined by $14 million from year-ago levels and $12 million sequentially, reflecting our strategic shift to lower cost operating model, which began in early '14.
Despite the customary increase in working capital during the first quarter, the company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt to total cap ratio of 14%, which positions us well to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Cameron's CapEx totaled $89 million in the first quarter of '15 as compared to $105 million in the first quarter of '14. We acquired almost 4 million shares during the first quarter of '15. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were about 192 million, and we have 298 million remaining under our authorization.
Let me now turn to our '15 outlook. To put it very simply, not much has changed for overall '15 as compared to what we told you on our Investor Call in January. Even though we executed extremely well during the first quarter, we continue to see significant headwinds from the cyclical downturn being experienced. We expect to ship about $5.7 billion of our year-end backlog in '15, consistent with what we thought in January. And as a reminder, we indicated our shorter-cycle business generated $4.4 billion of revenue in '14, and this will clearly come down in '15.
On our previous call, we indicated our overall consolidated margin could contract slightly less than 170 basis points. As we sit here today, we expect our focus on superior execution will result in a contraction in our consolidated operating income margin that is substantially less than we expected at the beginning of the year, although it still will be down from '14's level.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments. In our Subsea segment, we now expect $2 billion of Subsea's ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15 as compared to $2.1 billion we expected at the start of the year. Quarterly income -- operating income margins for Subsea will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still believe the full year margin will be substantially higher than the 6.7% in '14 and could approach 10% for '15.
In our Surface segment, we now expect $800 million of its ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15, and that was $750 million when we started the year. While Surface is significantly exposed in North America, approximately 60% of its '14 revenues, this business has a strong international footprint. And we think that, combined with our strong market share in North America, will help moderate the decline in revenue, as you might otherwise expect.
Operating income margin will show some variability from quarter-to-quarter and will clearly be under pressure all year, but we will offset some of that pressure through further cost reductions. Still, for the full year, operating income margin will be moderately below the 17.7% we posted in '14, which is what we said on our January call.
In our Drilling segment, we now expect $2.1 billion of Drilling's ""beginning of the year"" backlog to ship in '15, and that is compared to $2 billion that we expected at the beginning of the year. However, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more weakness than we had expected in our service business, which in '14 represented $963 million of revenues, as more land and deepwater rigs are idled than we expected in January.
Operating income margins for Drilling will vary from quarter-to-quarter due to mix. But the full year margin will comfortably exceed the 15.5% of '14, stronger than we had expected at the beginning of the year due to the strength of our execution.
In our Valves & Measurement segment, 2015 shipments from the ""beginning of the year"" backlog remains about $850 million. Operating income margin will remain under significant pressure all year and will bounce around from one quarter to the next. Full year operating income margin will be well below last year's level, but we think it will remain in double digits.
A few other '15 items to mention. As shown in this -- corporate expenses, as shown in this segment presentation, should approximate $110 million, which is lower than our previous guidance of $130 million due to the strategic restructuring of our corporate overhead functions. Interest expense should approximate $140 million. Intersegment revenue should approximate $200 million, and the corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Both of these numbers are higher than our previous forecast, as we continue to leverage cross-segment marketing and manufacturing opportunities. Our operational tax rates should approximate 23% for the year, our CapEx should be between $300 million and $350 million and our noncontrolling interest should be about $50 million.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Today, in North America, our share of that business and really around the pressure control equipment for the fracking operations; tree systems, frac trees, frac manifolds and frac valves is about 40%. So it's been a pretty incredible ride. In fact, we used to provide valves to a lot of the regional service providers for that service back in 2010 and '11. And it became evident to us that customers really wanted to deal with the folks that are designing it, building it and servicing it day in, day out. And that's what this platform does. And it's more than just the valves. It's really tying in the tree systems and the flow back systems that becomes a very efficient platform that customers are seeing with Cameron. Our measure is about 99% uptime in the performance of our equipment. That blows away anything else that is out there in the market. So you see in this downturn, we're still penetrating market share.

And you're just not going to get the activity levels in Brazil that we've had historically. And so that's probably the single biggest impairment. The Libra project in Brazil will ultimately go forward. We hope to see very -- the preliminary award for that in 2016. But absent of that, Brazil just doesn't move forward with a whole lot and they were the big drivers of subsea obviously. With that, excluding Brazil, we think the Gulf of Mexico moves forward at a reasonable pace.

So I just wonder how you think about your own business outlook between those 2 buckets. Where do you think the greatest potential is, let's say, over the next 12 to 18 months or maybe the next 2 to 3 years? I'll let you define the time frame. But I was very intrigued by the 50 million to 150 million barrel recovery from Jack/St. Malo, for example.

And many of our customers are weighted to -- some have heavier deepwater opportunities that they're anxious to get back in play. And we love our OneSubsea joint venture. We love the fact that it's helping our customers look differently at these projects and find ways to move them forward with lower cost and maybe higher return recoveries. And that's enabling -- I think it's going to be a huge enabler towards advancing that cycle recovery. So when you think of onshore, a lot of discussion around how quickly it can come back just because you can bring rigs back quicker, you can deploy assets and people quicker to the onshore plays. The onshore U.S. has been an incredible platform for growth for us with our CAMSHALE package. It's extremely competitive. We don't feel we have any equals in that field. We are going to continue to push the pedal on execution in that piece of the business. As Chuck said, our team has done a tremendous job of delivering the margin improvement but also managing the cost structure for the reality of where we're at.

And so over time, we actually want to grow that. We want to grow that mix. And we want to diversify it substantially away from installation and commissioning. But that downturn in Q1 really was timing with where we were with projects."

The company generated solid second quarter earnings and orders despite the significant challenges in today's markets. Specifically, we reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding other costs, of $0.83 for the second quarter of 2",554,"Thank you, Scott. The company generated solid second quarter earnings and orders despite the significant challenges in today's markets. Specifically, we reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding other costs, of $0.83 for the second quarter of 2015 compared to the $0.95 we earned in the second quarter of 2014.
Our financial results reflect a strong execution across the enterprise, specifically driven by our Subsea and Drilling segments. In addition, we continue to realize the benefits from our systemic cost-reduction programs across the Cameron enterprise that resulted in a 16% decline in our SG&A expense from a year ago.
Cyclical downturn continues to create uncertainty across all of the markets we serve, especially in relation to our shorter-cycle businesses. Broadly speaking, that uncertainty has caused demand to remain muted. Additionally, we continue to seek pricing pressure across all of our business segments.
Onshore markets have continued to be weak in North America, but we are seeing some evidence that the cycle maybe approaching a trough. One reason we say that is that we have seen a deceleration in the rate of order declines in our onshore North America businesses. Specifically, orders for North American onshore declined only 9% from Q1 to Q2 as compared to a roughly 40% decline from Q4 to Q1. As we've previously said, international markets approved to be a bit more resilient, and we actually saw an uptick in new orders internationally from our Surface systems businesses from Q1 to Q2.
When we look at the offshore markets, we continue to see demand for drilling products contract sharply when we compared to the year-ago quarter. That said, we did see a sequential quarter uptick in our orders for our Drilling Systems business.
In our Subsea business, the story is much more positive this quarter, with orders up both sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period. That both timing and scope of Deepwater production systems remains a question, our OneSubsea continues to see a healthy profit lift for Subsea processing awards. Strength of the prospect lift in our OneSubsea joint venture is a reflection of the competitive advantages of our offering. And again, more broadly, as both producers and suppliers collaborate to lower capital costs, increased recovery and reduce the cost per barrel, we believe many of these projects should ultimately move forward.
I have to take a step back and think about the bigger picture for Cameron, we're very fortunate to have a diverse offering of products and services that allows us to participate in the broader markets, both onshore and offshore, that make up our customer spending. To put a finer point on it, this means that Cameron is poised to benefit regardless of which particular and market recovers first.
We're encouraged by what we think are early signs of moderation in the pace of the decline in customer spending. As we have said previously, in the current environment, we remain focused on the things that we can control: Ongoing systemic reduction in our cost structure, excellence in execution, creating and maintaining strong customer relationships, growing our core platforms and steady investment in new technology. We believe this focus will ensure that the company generates long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
I'll now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Scott?"

More briefly after Jack's comment on the company's quarterly financial performance, we did execute very well.

More briefly after Jack's comment on the company's quarterly financial performance, we did execute very well. The organization did what it needed to do in this challenging environment, we made our decisions, we moved quickly, we're doing what we need to do and we did all of this while embracing our customers during this difficult time.
While Chuck walk you to the details of our earnings, but I do want to talk about a bit about of orders. The headline here is that on a consolidated basis, orders increased 15% sequentially. In our Subsea segment, orders were 32% above the first quarter of 2015, and the book-to-bill ratio for the Subsea segment was well above 1.
Clearly, OneSubsea has maintained good momentum through this cyclical downturn. Second quarter accomplishments include: A $330 million award for Subsea production equipment for our project offshore North Africa; our front-end engineering design contract with Woodside for proposed floating LNG development, Offshore Northwest Australia. Woodside order's particularly exciting for us, because it's the first contact we have won under the frame agreement we signed with them a year ago, and we expect more to come under this agreement; the signing of an alliance agreement with Subsea 7 to further round out the OneSubsea portfolio. The alliance will work closely with our clients to optimize the Subsea production hardware and the Subsea on vocals, risers and full lines and cost-effective solutions for operators. This is a further link in the chain of our Pore to Process approach that aimed at reducing development costs for our customers and as importantly, improving the recovery factor in Deepwater developments.
Additionally, the signing of the agreement with Chevron to form a joint industry program to develop Subsea technology for 20K applications. This is a natural migration of Cameron's high pressure technology that we have already developed and deployed in our Drilling and Surface businesses.
And finally, as we're announcing today, a significant award within the quarter for a Subsea boosting system in the Gulf of Mexico. We'll provide more details on this award in upcoming press release.
Looking at our other segments. Orders were also up on a sequential basis for Surface and Drilling by 5% and 23%, respectively. The increase in surface was driven by international new equipment orders. The increase in drilling was aided by gains in services and new equipment, including several jack-up orders. 
Orders in Valves & Measurement declined sequentially by about 5%, which is broadly reflective of what we are seeing in terms of overall demand.
In the execution front, our operation teams are performing well within the context of what is happening in this marketplace, with our customers and the competition. Specifically, we continue to execute our downturn playbook that we had put together last year outlining a program to build better customer relations, develop technology for the future, optimize our internal processes and drive down our cost structure.
Let me sight a few examples on this. As the first playbook relates to customers, I will say that we are having the kinds of discussions today that we would never had a year ago. Discussions that are much more collaborative and often coming much earlier in the life of the cycle of a project. Customers and suppliers are working together to eliminate some of the inefficiencies that crept into the business in the area of high oil prices. Many of our customer discussions are about finding specific ways to improve operational efficiencies and to improve the return on capital for their investments. Clearly, operators today realized that collaboration with suppliers has the potential to unlock new and creative approaches that will save money and generate returns in this market. Our ultimate objective in this discussion is an outcome that reduces cost for the customer while enabling Cameron to gain share and maintain margin. In other words, a win-win situation.
A playbook in relation to new technology is essentially this, a commitment to maintain our R&D spending throughout the cycle. We believe that technology spending is essential for us to retain our competitive advantage. We've seen some of these results with our recent accomplishments. First, the world's first gas compressor -- wet gas compression for which we won an OTC Spotlight award; mark for high available to control pod for BOPs, which also won an OTC Spotlight award; the industry's first and only 13.58 [ph] 25K [ph] blowout preventer in the first to market with the 25K surface production system. A joint technology program between OneSubsea and Helix to engineer and manufacture a 15K intervention riser system as well as a 20K joint industry program with Chevron that I mentioned a moment ago.
The last element of our downturn playbook is a companywide effort to reduce a fundamental cost structure. This effort started prior to the downturn and has helped us minimize the margin impact on our businesses. Essentially, we have taken a fresh look at everything we do and challenged ourselves to drive efficiency throughout our organization. 
As a practical matter, and what this means is that we are streamlining internal processes and organizations. We're significantly reducing the cost structure of the organization through reorganization, improved processes and leveraging the entire Cameron enterprise. One visible example of this is the 16% reduction in our SG&A, as Jack cited earlier. We will continue to do what we need to do to rightsize our business and this environment while creating a scalable model that will allow us to grow profitably -- will allow us to grow more profitably than in past up cycles when the recovery ultimately does come.
Again, overall market conditions are challenging but we are seeing signs of activity stabilizing in North America, and that will help our onshore-focused businesses, which include Surface, Valves & Measurement and portions of our Drilling segment; recover relatively quickly once we see activity levels actually increase.
Our Subsea segment is making steady progress in demonstrating how we can help customers improve recoveries. For this reason, we reiterate our view that Subsea orders will be at or above 2014 order levels, with the back half of for the year weighted to the fourth quarter.
We believe the breadth of our portfolio will allow us to take advantage of the marketplace, despite the shape or style of the recovery. We remain committed to our multiyear margin improvement program, and we believe that our ability to generate solid results thus far during a tough market is a clear indication that we are on the right path.
On that note, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
19839,295311490,836513,"Cameron International Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments: Subsea was up 4% sequentially; revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-to-",1072,"Thanks, Scott. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments: Subsea was up 4% sequentially; revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-to-quarter; revenues in Surface and V&M were down sequentially about 6% and 11%, respectively. The good news is that the pace of these declines in our shorter-cycle components of Surface and V&M seem to be moderating.
EBIT margins before other costs were 12.1% for the quarter, which is 50 basis points higher when compared to the year quarter -- year-ago quarter, down sequentially about 70 basis points. No surprise there, as our Surface business reflects the level of North American activity declines. However, it appears that surface margins may have bottomed in Q2. As both Jack and Scott mentioned, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and our second quarter results show further evidence of our progress in this regard.
Consolidated SG&A expense was down 16% versus a year-ago quarter and also modestly below the level of Q1. Operating EPS was $0.83, which was below the year-ago quarter and below the first quarter of this year. That's no surprise given the market conditions.
Excluding from operating earnings and our other costs amounting to $0.12 per share primarily for restructuring costs to valuation an ongoing currency and accelerated write-downs of underutilize assets. Now a few words about each segment.
Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the year-ago quarter due to the timing of project deliveries. That being said, revenues increased on a sequential basis as expected. Q1 represented the seasonal low point for Subsea revenues. Operating income margins came in at 10.2%, almost 400 basis points above the year-ago quarter and also above Q1, with improved execution and cost reduction.
Surface revenues were down versus the year-ago quarter and on a sequential quarter basis, due largely to the weakness in the shorter-cycle North American market. The North American revenues for Surface, which accounted for -- which account for most of the shorter-cycle businesses, were down 41% from the year-ago quarter and down 19% from the preceding quarter. Our international market actually grew on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.
The operating income margin for Surface was 13.5%. Q2 margin reflects continued weakness in activity levels in North America as well as pricing pressure. Operating income margin for Surface in Q2 was also negatively impacted by FX losses, which lowered the margin by 80 basis points. For sake of clarity, what I'm referring to is FX losses represent balance sheet remeasurement of our net monetary positions in that segment.
In drilling, no surprise on the revenue front. Revenues were 6% below the level of a year-ago, but essentially flat sequentially. Decline in revenues versus the year-ago quarter was driven by our shorter-cycle services businesses as the steep production activity levels have clearly affected our drilling customers' spending patterns. The operating income margin in drilling was 16.6%, which is almost 400 basis points above the year-ago quarter and clearly shows the improved execution of this business. The Q2 margin was down on a sequential quarter basis, due primarily to FX losses, which lowered Drillings operating income margin by approximately 100 basis points.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined sharply in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the first quarter '15. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the North American market. North American revenues for V&M, which represents most of its shorter-cycle businesses, were down about 19% as compared to the preceding quarter and 33% down from the year-ago quarter. As Scott mentioned, we've begun to see signs that the North American portion of this business has began to stabilize.
Operating income margin in V&M was 11.5%, which was modestly up from the level of Q1 as expected. Net sequential quarter improvement is attributable to cost-reduction efforts.
The Q2 margin was well below the level of year-ago, reflecting the impact of the destocking of distributor inventories in North America. Corporate expense declined by $15 million from year-ago levels, reflecting our strategic shift to a lower-cost operating model. The company ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion, a net debt to cap ratio of 17%. Cameron's overall liquidity gives us significant flexibility to deal with the uncertainties presented by this downcycle, execute on our strategic initiatives and position ourselves for growth.
Cameron's CapEx was $41 million in the second quarter as compared to $73 million in the second quarter '14. As of the end of the second quarter '15, approximately $285 million remained under our share repurchase program.
Now let's turn to outlook. Overall, Q2 revenue -- overall revenues in Q3 and 4 [indiscernible] around the levels of Q2. As far as overall EBIT margin goes, Q3 should remain around the level of Q2 before we see a slight uptick in Q4.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments.
Our Subsea segment, we expect to see revenues in the second half of '15 that are well above first half levels, with Subsea's operating income margin for the second half topping 10%. In our Surface segment, we are likely to see second half revenues that are somewhat lower than half 1. We believe that Q2 is likely to be the low point for Surface margins this year and could see slight increases for Q3 and 4.
In our Drilling segment, second half revenues are likely to be moderately below half 1 levels, maybe around 10% lower. We think the operating income margin will increase in each of the remaining quarters and could approach 20% in Q4. In our Valves & Measurement segment, second half revenues are likely to be somewhat below half 1, with quarterly revenues not bearing materially from the level of Q2.
A few other '15 items to mention. Corporate expenses should be approximately $100 million for the year, which is $10 million lower than our previous guidance of $110 million, interest expense should approximate $140 million and our segment revenue should approximate $200 million. The corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Our operating tax rate should approximate 23%, our CapEx will be in the approximate range from $300 million to $350 million and noncontrolling interest should be around $50 million.
With that, Scott, let's open up for questions."

Really, with the OneSubsea formation, right, we've always said we want to optimize the Pore to Process approach for Deepwater developments. And really, this, i just 1 link in the chain to do that, right? So originally, we brought the reservoir and the SBS together with Summer J and Cameron, then we went to light a field just because we saw tremendous opportunities in light of field so we partnered with Helix who is leading that. And really, the focus there and the focus in the beginning was always around driving more out of Deepwater development. So improving recovery rates and helping operators get more out of existing assets. And announced today in this environment where cost is really the largest process, we do think there's opportunities between the SBS, the production system and the surf equipment to drive costs down and improve the installability of what we're putting on the seafloor. So I think it's really for us, it's a natural progression. Again, we've said from the beginning, we really want to work on helping operators from Pore to Process, and this is a nice next step for us."

And Doug and his team are absolutely focused on what are the markets and where do we want to play, how do we have a sales force that can connect our products to those markets, investing in technology in the valve portfolio and then making sure that his team is aligned around all of those goals within there. So I just think it's -- I mean,, at the corporate side, right, we've talked about large SG&A and transforming what we're doing on the corporate side. And those initiatives are going well and we take those off in earnest just under a year ago, and we're really moving toward driving some -- leveraging the entire Cameron enterprise across our functional spending."

So we feel very good about that. When you think of Deepwater versus onshore recovery rates, in the Deepwater, the best wells are still in the teens that maybe a 20%, whereas onshore, you're getting upwards of 30% to 50% recovery. So the goal is to convert Deepwater wells and get them ultimately to look something like the onshore wells. And we think we can do that by putting energy on the seafloor and being able to intervene in those wells on a regular basis to help stimulate production. So there's not 1 magic number, there's not a benchmark we've talked about, but when we think in sit down with operators and really start to understand what their reservoir characteristics are, we ultimately think that we can improve the recovery rates, and we talked about different solutions to do that."

And going back through, all of their assumptions that built their model and then also putting standardized solutions there that the drive costs down, putting energy on the seafloor and potentially changing the way the SBS looks like on the seafloor.

Our financial results reflect a strong execution across the enterprise, specifically driven by our Subsea and Drilling segments. In addition, we continue to realize the benefits from our systemic cost-reduction programs across the Cameron enterprise that resulted in a 16% decline in our SG&A expense from a year ago.
Cyclical downturn continues to create uncertainty across all of the markets we serve, especially in relation to our shorter-cycle businesses. Broadly speaking, that uncertainty has caused demand to remain muted. Additionally, we continue to see pricing pressure across all of our business segments.
Onshore markets have continued to be weak in North America, but we are seeing some evidence that the cycle may be approaching a trough. One reason we say that is that we have seen a deceleration in the rate of order declines in our onshore North America businesses. Specifically, orders for North American onshore declined only 9% from Q1 to Q2 as compared to a roughly 40% decline from Q4 to Q1. As we've previously said, international markets have proved to be a bit more resilient, and we actually saw an uptick in new orders internationally from our Surface Systems businesses from Q1 to Q2.
When we look at the offshore markets, we continue to see demand for drilling products contract sharply when we compared to the year-ago quarter. That said, we did see a sequential quarter uptick in our orders for our Drilling Systems business.
In our Subsea business, the story is much more positive this quarter, with orders up both sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period. And while both timing and scope of deepwater production systems remains a question, our OneSubsea continues to see a healthy prospect list for Subsea processing awards. Strength of the prospect list in our OneSubsea joint venture is a reflection of the competitive advantages of our offering. And again, more broadly, as both producers and suppliers collaborate to lower capital cost, increased recovery and reduce the cost per barrel, we believe many of these projects should ultimately move forward.
Now to take a step back and think about the bigger picture for Cameron, we're very fortunate to have a diverse offering of products and services that allows us to participate in the broader markets, both onshore and offshore, that make up our customer spending. To put a finer point on it, this means that Cameron is poised to benefit regardless of which particular end market recovers first.
We're encouraged by what we think are early signs of moderation in the pace of the decline in customer spending. As we have said previously, in the current environment, we remain focused on the things that we can control: ongoing systemic reduction in our cost structure, excellence in execution, creating and maintaining strong customer relationships, growing our core platforms and steady investment in new technology. We believe this focus will ensure that the company generates long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
I will now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Scott?"

The organization did what it needed to do in this challenging environment. We made hard decisions. We moved quickly. We're doing what we need to do, and we did all of this while embracing our customers during this difficult time.
I'll let Chuck walk you through the details of our earnings, but I do want to talk a bit about Cameron's orders. The headline here is that on a consolidated basis, orders increased 15% sequentially. In our Subsea segment, orders were 32% above the first quarter of 2015, and the book-to-bill ratio for the Subsea segment was well above 1. Clearly, OneSubsea has maintained good momentum through this cyclical downturn. Second quarter accomplishments include a $330 million award for subsea production equipment for a project offshore North Africa; a front-end engineering design contract with Woodside for a proposed floating LNG development offshore Northwest Australia. The Woodside order is particularly exciting for us because it's the first contract we have won under the frame agreement we signed with them a year ago, and we expect more to come under this agreement. 
The signing of an alliance agreement with Subsea 7 to further round out the OneSubsea portfolio. The alliance will work closely with our clients to optimize the subsea production hardware and the subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines and drive cost-effective solutions for operators. This is a further link in the chain of our Pore to Process approach that aimed at reducing development cost for our customers and, as importantly, improving the recovery factor in deepwater developments.
Additionally, the signing of the agreement with Chevron to form a joint industry program to develop subsea technology for 20K applications. This is a natural migration of Cameron's high-pressure technology that we have already developed and deployed in our Drilling and Surface businesses.
And finally, as we're announcing today, a significant award within the quarter for a subsea boosting system in the Gulf of Mexico. We'll provide more details on this award in an upcoming press release.
Looking at our other segments, orders were also up on a sequential basis for Surface and Drilling by 5% and 23%, respectively. The increase in Surface was driven by international new equipment orders. The increase in Drilling was aided by gains in services and new equipment, including several jack-up orders. 
Orders in Valves & Measurement declined sequentially by about 5%, which is broadly reflective of what we are seeing in terms of overall demand.
In the execution front, our operations teams are performing well within the context of what is happening in this marketplace, with our customers and the competition. Specifically, we continue to execute our downturn playbook that we had put together last year, outlining a program to build better customer relations, develop technology for the future, optimize our internal processes and drive down our cost structure.
Let me cite a few examples on this. As the first playbook relates to customers, I will say that we are having the kinds of discussions today that we would never had a year ago, discussions that are much more collaborative and often coming much earlier in the life of the cycle of a project. Customers and suppliers are working together to eliminate some of the inefficiencies that crept into the business in the era of high oil prices. Many of our customer discussions are about finding specific ways to improve operational efficiencies and to improve the return on capital for their investments. Clearly, operators today realize that collaboration with suppliers has the potential to unlock new and creative approaches that will save money and generate returns in this market. Our ultimate objective in this discussion is an outcome that reduces cost for the customer while enabling Cameron to gain share and maintain margin, in other words, a win-win situation.
The playbook in relation to new technology is essentially this, a commitment to maintain our R&D spending throughout the cycle. We believe that technology spending is essential for us to retain our competitive advantages. We've seen some of these results with our recent accomplishments: first, the world's first gas compressor -- wet gas compressor for which we won an OTC Spotlight award; Mark IV High Availability Control POD for BOPs, which also won an OTC Spotlight award; the industry's first and only 13-5/8"" 25K blowout preventer and the first to market with a 25K surface production system; a joint technology program between OneSubsea and Helix to engineer and manufacture a 15K intervention riser system; as well as a 20K joint industry program with Chevron that I mentioned a moment ago.
The last element of our downturn playbook is our company-wide effort to reduce our fundamental cost structure. This effort started prior to the downturn and has helped us minimize the margin impact on our businesses. Essentially, we have taken a fresh look at everything we do and challenged ourselves to drive efficiency throughout our organization. As a practical matter, what this means is that we are streamlining internal processes and organizations. We're significantly reducing the cost structure of the organization through reorganization, improved processes and leveraging the entire Cameron enterprise. One visible example of this is the 16% reduction in our SG&A, as Jack cited earlier. We will continue to do what we need to do to rightsize our business in this environment while creating a scalable model that will allow us to grow profitably -- will allow us to grow more profitably than in past up-cycles when the recovery ultimately does come.
Again, overall market conditions are challenging, but we are seeing signs of activity stabilizing in North America, and that will help our onshore-focused businesses, which include Surface, Valves & Measurement and portions of our Drilling segment, recover relatively quickly once we see activity levels actually increase.
Our Subsea segment is making steady progress in demonstrating how we can help customers improve recoveries. For this reason, we reiterate our view that Subsea orders will be at or above 2014 order levels, with the back half of the year weighted to the fourth quarter.
We believe the breadth of our portfolio will allow us to take advantage of the marketplace despite the shape or style of the recovery. We remain committed to our multiyear margin improvement program, and we believe that our ability to generate solid results thus far during a tough market is a clear indication that we are on the right path.
On that note, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
19839,295311490,836898,"Cameron International Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Cameron International Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter of this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments. Subsea was up 4% sequentially. Revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-",1075,"Thanks, Scott. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter of this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments. Subsea was up 4% sequentially. Revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Revenues in Surface and V&M were down sequentially about 6% and 11%, respectively. The good news is that the pace of the declines in our shorter-cycle components of Surface and V&M seem to be moderating.
EBIT margins before other costs were 12.1% for the quarter, which is 50 basis points higher when compared to the year quarter -- year-ago quarter, down sequentially about 70 basis points. No surprise there as our Surface business reflects the level of North American activity declines. However, it appears that Surface margins may have bottomed in Q2. As both Jack and Scott mentioned, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and our second quarter results show further evidence of our progress in this regard.
Consolidated SG&A expense was down 16% versus year-ago quarter and also modestly below the level of Q1. Operating EPS was $0.83, which is below the year-ago quarter and below the first quarter of this year. That's no surprise given the market conditions. Excluding -- excluded from operating earnings are other costs amounting to $0.12 per share primarily for restructuring cost, devaluation of the Angolan currency and accelerated write-downs of underutilized assets. 
Now a few words about each segment. Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the year-ago quarter due to the timing of project deliveries. That being said, revenues increased on a sequential basis as expected. Q1 represented the seasonal low point for Subsea revenues. Operating income margin came in at 10.2%, almost 400 basis points above the year-ago quarter and also above Q1 due to improved execution and cost reduction. 
Surface revenues were down versus the year-ago quarter and on a sequential quarter basis due largely to the weakness in the shorter-cycle North American market. The North American revenues for Surface, which accounted for -- which account for most of the shorter-cycle businesses, were down 41% from the year-ago quarter and down 19% from the preceding quarter. Our international market actually grew on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.  The operating income margin for Surface was 13.5%. Q2 margin reflects continued weakness in activity levels in North America as well as pricing pressure. Operating income margin for Surface in Q2 was also negatively impacted by FX losses, which lowered the margin by 80 basis points. For sake of clarity, what I'm referring to as FX losses represent balance sheet remeasurement of our net monetary positions in that segment.
In Drilling, no surprise on the revenue front. Revenues were 6% below the level of a year ago but essentially flat sequentially. The decline in revenues versus the year-ago quarter was driven by our shorter-cycle services businesses as the steep reduction activity levels have clearly affected our Drilling customers' spending patterns. The operating income margin in Drilling was 16.6%, which is almost 400 basis points above the year-ago quarter and clearly shows the improved execution in this business. The Q2 margin was down on a sequential quarter basis due primarily to FX losses, which lowered Drilling's operating income margin by approximately 100 basis points.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined sharply in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the first quarter '15. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the North American market. North American revenues for V&M, which represent most of its shorter-cycle businesses, were down about 19% as compared to the preceding quarter and 33% down from the year-ago quarter. As Scott mentioned, we've begun to see signs that the North American portion of this business has begun to stabilize. Operating income margin in V&M was 11.5%, which is modestly up from the level of Q1 as expected. Net sequential quarter improvement is attributable to cost-reduction efforts. The Q2 margin was well below the level of a year ago, reflecting the impact of the de-stocking of distributor inventories in North America. Corporate expense declined by $15 million from year-ago levels, reflecting our strategic shift to a lower-cost operating model. The company ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 17%. Cameron's overall liquidity gives us significant flexibility to deal with the uncertainties presented by this down-cycle, execute on our strategic initiatives and position ourselves for growth.
Cameron's CapEx was $41 million in the second quarter as compared to $73 million in the second quarter '14. As of the end of the second quarter '15, approximately $285 million remained under our share repurchase program.
Now let's turn to outlook. Overall revenues in Q3 and 4 should hover around the levels of Q2. As far as overall EBIT margin goes, Q3 should remain around the level of Q2 before we see a slight uptick in Q4.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments.  In our Subsea segment, we expect to see revenues in the second half of '15 that are well above first half levels, with Subsea's operating income margin for the second half topping 10%. In our Surface segment, we are likely to see second half revenues that are somewhat lower than half 1. We believe that Q2 is likely to be the low point for Surface margins this year and could see slight increases for Q3 and 4. In our Drilling segment, second half revenues are likely to be moderately below half 1 levels, maybe around 10% lower. We think the operating income margin will increase in each of the remaining quarters and could approach 20% in Q4. In our Valves & Measurement segment, second half revenues are likely to be somewhat below half 1, with quarterly margins not varying materially from the level of Q2.
A few other '15 items to mention. Corporate expenses should be approximately $100 million for the year, which is $10 million lower than our previous guidance of $110 million. Interest expense should approximate $140 million, and our segment revenues should approximate $200 million. The corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Our operating tax rate should approximate 23%. Our CapEx will be in the approximate range from $300 million to $350 million, and noncontrolling interest should be around $50 million.
With that, Scott, let's open up for questions."

And we can have meaningful discussions with operators around what we think their developments can do and what the potential on that. So we feel very good about that. When we think of deepwater versus onshore recovery rates, in the deepwater, the best wells are still in the teens to maybe 20%, whereas onshore, you're getting upwards of 30% to 50% recovery. So the goal is to convert deepwater wells and get them ultimately to look something like the onshore wells. We think we can do that by putting energy on the seafloor and being able to intervene in those wells on a regular basis to help stimulate production. So there's not one magic number.

And it's not necessarily around cost reduction, but it's really around what their rate of return is and their hurdle rate internally. That's adjusted for all the risk factors and the macro environment with oil pricing and political or geographic and political risks. And so what we're doing is sitting down with teams with the IOCs and say, okay, well, let us look at this one, and maybe you've got a wrong assumption there on pump life or a different assumption on flow assurance and going back through all their assumptions that built their model and then also putting standardized solutions there that will drive costs down, putting energy on the seafloor and potentially changing the way the SPS looks like on the seafloor. Now with Subsea 7, right, we now have the ability to talk about the handover and the interfaces on the SURF side and the installability of that system. And so now we can drive -- we can talk about bringing cost down and bringing recovery rates up, which ultimately generates higher IRR, which is really what the IOCs are after."

The company generated solid second quarter earnings and orders despite the significant challenges in today's markets. Specifically, we reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding other costs, of $0.83 for the second quarter of 2015 compared to the $0.95 we earned in the second quarter of 2014.
Our financial results reflect a strong execution across the enterprise, specifically driven by our Subsea and Drilling segments. In addition, we continue to realize the benefits from our systemic cost-reduction programs across the Cameron enterprise that resulted in a 16% decline in our SG&A expense from a year ago.
Cyclical downturn continues to create uncertainty across all of the markets we serve, especially in relation to our shorter-cycle businesses. Broadly speaking, that uncertainty has caused demand to remain muted. Additionally, we continue to see pricing pressure across all of our business segments.
Onshore markets have continued to be weak in North America, but we are seeing some evidence that the cycle may be approaching a trough. One reason we say that is that we have seen a deceleration in the rate of order declines in our onshore North America businesses. Specifically, orders for North American onshore declined only 9% from Q1 to Q2 as compared to a roughly 40% decline from Q4 to Q1. As we've previously said, international markets have proved to be a bit more resilient, and we actually saw an uptick in new orders internationally from our Surface Systems businesses from Q1 to Q2.
When we look at the offshore markets, we continue to see demand for drilling products contract sharply when we compared to the year-ago quarter. That said, we did see a sequential quarter uptick in our orders for our Drilling Systems business.
In our Subsea business, the story is much more positive this quarter, with orders up both sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period. And while both timing and scope of deepwater production systems remains a question, our OneSubsea continues to see a healthy prospect list for Subsea processing awards. Strength of the prospect list in our OneSubsea joint venture is a reflection of the competitive advantages of our offering. And again, more broadly, as both producers and suppliers collaborate to lower capital cost, increased recovery and reduce the cost per barrel, we believe many of these projects should ultimately move forward.
Now to take a step back and think about the bigger picture for Cameron, we're very fortunate to have a diverse offering of products and services that allows us to participate in the broader markets, both onshore and offshore, that make up our customer spending. To put a finer point on it, this means that Cameron is poised to benefit regardless of which particular end market recovers first.
We're encouraged by what we think are early signs of moderation in the pace of the decline in customer spending. As we have said previously, in the current environment, we remain focused on the things that we can control: ongoing systemic reduction in our cost structure, excellence in execution, creating and maintaining strong customer relationships, growing our core platforms and steady investment in new technology. We believe this focus will ensure that the company generates long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
I will now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Scott?"

The organization did what it needed to do in this challenging environment. We made hard decisions. We moved quickly. We're doing what we need to do, and we did all of this while embracing our customers during this difficult time.
I'll let Chuck walk you through the details of our earnings, but I do want to talk a bit about Cameron's orders. The headline here is that on a consolidated basis, orders increased 15% sequentially. In our Subsea segment, orders were 32% above the first quarter of 2015, and the book-to-bill ratio for the Subsea segment was well above 1. Clearly, OneSubsea has maintained good momentum through this cyclical downturn. Second quarter accomplishments include a $330 million award for subsea production equipment for a project offshore North Africa; a front-end engineering design contract with Woodside for a proposed floating LNG development offshore Northwest Australia. The Woodside order is particularly exciting for us because it's the first contract we have won under the frame agreement we signed with them a year ago, and we expect more to come under this agreement. 
The signing of an alliance agreement with Subsea 7 to further round out the OneSubsea portfolio. The alliance will work closely with our clients to optimize the subsea production hardware and the subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines and drive cost-effective solutions for operators. This is a further link in the chain of our Pore to Process approach that aimed at reducing development cost for our customers and, as importantly, improving the recovery factor in deepwater developments.
Additionally, the signing of the agreement with Chevron to form a joint industry program to develop subsea technology for 20K applications. This is a natural migration of Cameron's high-pressure technology that we have already developed and deployed in our Drilling and Surface businesses.
And finally, as we're announcing today, a significant award within the quarter for a subsea boosting system in the Gulf of Mexico. We'll provide more details on this award in an upcoming press release.
Looking at our other segments, orders were also up on a sequential basis for Surface and Drilling by 5% and 23%, respectively. The increase in Surface was driven by international new equipment orders. The increase in Drilling was aided by gains in services and new equipment, including several jack-up orders. 
Orders in Valves & Measurement declined sequentially by about 5%, which is broadly reflective of what we are seeing in terms of overall demand.
In the execution front, our operations teams are performing well within the context of what is happening in this marketplace, with our customers and the competition. Specifically, we continue to execute our downturn playbook that we had put together last year, outlining a program to build better customer relations, develop technology for the future, optimize our internal processes and drive down our cost structure.
Let me cite a few examples on this. As the first playbook relates to customers, I will say that we are having the kinds of discussions today that we would never had a year ago, discussions that are much more collaborative and often coming much earlier in the life of the cycle of a project. Customers and suppliers are working together to eliminate some of the inefficiencies that crept into the business in the era of high oil prices. Many of our customer discussions are about finding specific ways to improve operational efficiencies and to improve the return on capital for their investments. Clearly, operators today realize that collaboration with suppliers has the potential to unlock new and creative approaches that will save money and generate returns in this market. Our ultimate objective in this discussion is an outcome that reduces cost for the customer while enabling Cameron to gain share and maintain margin, in other words, a win-win situation.
The playbook in relation to new technology is essentially this, a commitment to maintain our R&D spending throughout the cycle. We believe that technology spending is essential for us to retain our competitive advantages. We've seen some of these results with our recent accomplishments: first, the world's first gas compressor -- wet gas compressor for which we won an OTC Spotlight award; Mark IV High Availability Control POD for BOPs, which also won an OTC Spotlight award; the industry's first and only 13-5/8"" 25K blowout preventer and the first to market with a 25K surface production system; a joint technology program between OneSubsea and Helix to engineer and manufacture a 15K intervention riser system; as well as a 20K joint industry program with Chevron that I mentioned a moment ago.
The last element of our downturn playbook is our company-wide effort to reduce our fundamental cost structure. This effort started prior to the downturn and has helped us minimize the margin impact on our businesses. Essentially, we have taken a fresh look at everything we do and challenged ourselves to drive efficiency throughout our organization. As a practical matter, what this means is that we are streamlining internal processes and organizations. We're significantly reducing the cost structure of the organization through reorganization, improved processes and leveraging the entire Cameron enterprise. One visible example of this is the 16% reduction in our SG&A, as Jack cited earlier. We will continue to do what we need to do to rightsize our business in this environment while creating a scalable model that will allow us to grow profitably -- will allow us to grow more profitably than in past up-cycles when the recovery ultimately does come.
Again, overall market conditions are challenging, but we are seeing signs of activity stabilizing in North America, and that will help our onshore-focused businesses, which include Surface, Valves & Measurement and portions of our Drilling segment, recover relatively quickly once we see activity levels actually increase.
Our Subsea segment is making steady progress in demonstrating how we can help customers improve recoveries. For this reason, we reiterate our view that Subsea orders will be at or above 2014 order levels, with the back half of the year weighted to the fourth quarter.
We believe the breadth of our portfolio will allow us to take advantage of the marketplace despite the shape or style of the recovery. We remain committed to our multiyear margin improvement program, and we believe that our ability to generate solid results thus far during a tough market is a clear indication that we are on the right path.
On that note, I'll turn it over to Chuck."

Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter of this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments. Subsea was up 4% sequentially. Revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-",1075,"Thanks, Scott. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter of this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments. Subsea was up 4% sequentially. Revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Revenues in Surface and V&M were down sequentially about 6% and 11%, respectively. The good news is that the pace of the declines in our shorter-cycle components of Surface and V&M seem to be moderating.
EBIT margins before other costs were 12.1% for the quarter, which is 50 basis points higher when compared to the year quarter -- year-ago quarter, down sequentially about 70 basis points. No surprise there as our Surface business reflects the level of North American activity declines. However, it appears that Surface margins may have bottomed in Q2. As both Jack and Scott mentioned, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and our second quarter results show further evidence of our progress in this regard.
Consolidated SG&A expense was down 16% versus year-ago quarter and also modestly below the level of Q1. Operating EPS was $0.83, which is below the year-ago quarter and below the first quarter of this year. That's no surprise given the market conditions. Excluding -- excluded from operating earnings are other costs amounting to $0.12 per share primarily for restructuring cost, devaluation of the Angolan currency and accelerated write-downs of underutilized assets. 
Now a few words about each segment. Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the year-ago quarter due to the timing of project deliveries. That being said, revenues increased on a sequential basis as expected. Q1 represented the seasonal low point for Subsea revenues. Operating income margin came in at 10.2%, almost 400 basis points above the year-ago quarter and also above Q1 due to improved execution and cost reduction. 
Surface revenues were down versus the year-ago quarter and on a sequential quarter basis due largely to the weakness in the shorter-cycle North American market. The North American revenues for Surface, which accounted for -- which account for most of the shorter-cycle businesses, were down 41% from the year-ago quarter and down 19% from the preceding quarter. Our international market actually grew on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.  The operating income margin for Surface was 13.5%. Q2 margin reflects continued weakness in activity levels in North America as well as pricing pressure. Operating income margin for Surface in Q2 was also negatively impacted by FX losses, which lowered the margin by 80 basis points. For sake of clarity, what I'm referring to as FX losses represent balance sheet remeasurement of our net monetary positions in that segment.
In Drilling, no surprise on the revenue front. Revenues were 6% below the level of a year ago but essentially flat sequentially. The decline in revenues versus the year-ago quarter was driven by our shorter-cycle services businesses as the steep reduction activity levels have clearly affected our Drilling customers' spending patterns. The operating income margin in Drilling was 16.6%, which is almost 400 basis points above the year-ago quarter and clearly shows the improved execution in this business. The Q2 margin was down on a sequential quarter basis due primarily to FX losses, which lowered Drilling's operating income margin by approximately 100 basis points.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined sharply in comparison to the year-ago quarter and the first quarter '15. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the North American market. North American revenues for V&M, which represent most of its shorter-cycle businesses, were down about 19% as compared to the preceding quarter and 33% down from the year-ago quarter. As Scott mentioned, we've begun to see signs that the North American portion of this business has begun to stabilize. Operating income margin in V&M was 11.5%, which is modestly up from the level of Q1 as expected. Net sequential quarter improvement is attributable to cost-reduction efforts. The Q2 margin was well below the level of a year ago, reflecting the impact of the de-stocking of distributor inventories in North America. Corporate expense declined by $15 million from year-ago levels, reflecting our strategic shift to a lower-cost operating model. The company ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 17%. Cameron's overall liquidity gives us significant flexibility to deal with the uncertainties presented by this down-cycle, execute on our strategic initiatives and position ourselves for growth.
Cameron's CapEx was $41 million in the second quarter as compared to $73 million in the second quarter '14. As of the end of the second quarter '15, approximately $285 million remained under our share repurchase program.
Now let's turn to outlook. Overall revenues in Q3 and 4 should hover around the levels of Q2. As far as overall EBIT margin goes, Q3 should remain around the level of Q2 before we see a slight uptick in Q4.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments.  In our Subsea segment, we expect to see revenues in the second half of '15 that are well above first half levels, with Subsea's operating income margin and the second half topping 10%. In our Surface segment, we are likely to see second half revenues that are somewhat lower than half 1. We believe that Q2 is likely to be the low point for Surface margins this year and could see slight increases for Q3 and 4. In our Drilling segment, second half revenues are likely to be moderately below half 1 levels, maybe around 10% lower. We think the operating income margin will increase in each of the remaining quarters and could approach 20% in Q4. In our Valves & Measurement segment, second half revenues are likely to be somewhat below half 1, with quarterly margins not varying materially from the level of Q2.
A few other '15 items to mention. Corporate expenses should be approximately $100 million for the year, which is $10 million lower than our previous guidance of $110 million. Interest expense should approximate $140 million, and our segment revenues should approximate $200 million. The corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Our operating tax rate should approximate 23%. Our CapEx will be in the approximate range from $300 million to $350 million, and noncontrolling interest should be around $50 million.
With that, Scott, let's open up for questions."

And really, the focus there and the focus at the beginning was always around driving more out of deepwater development, so improving recovery rates and helping operators get more out of existing assets. And then now, today, in this environment where cost is really the largest focus, we do think there's opportunities between the SPS, right, the production system and the SURF equipment to drive cost down and improve the installability of what we're putting on the seafloor. So I think it's -- really, for us, it's a natural progression.

When we think of deepwater versus onshore recovery rates, in the deepwater, the best wells are still in the teens to maybe 20%, whereas onshore, you're getting upwards of 30% to 50% recovery. So the goal is to convert deepwater wells and get them ultimately to look something like the onshore wells. We think we can do that by putting energy on the seafloor and being able to intervene in those wells on a regular basis to help stimulate production. So there's not one magic number.

And so that's really the -- what we're trying to do there is get a stronghold with the Woodside organization and particularly, the northwest shelf of Australia to leverage what we have there as infrastructure already. And then that life of field and that services should come through at real nice margins over the long time."

The company generated solid second quarter earnings and orders despite the significant challenges in today's markets. Specifically, we reported fully diluted earnings per share, excluding other costs, of $0.83 for the second quarter of 2015 compared to the $0.95 we earned in the second quarter of 2014.
Our financial results reflect a strong execution across the enterprise, specifically driven by our Subsea and Drilling segments. In addition, we continue to realize the benefits from our systemic cost-reduction programs across the Cameron enterprise that resulted in a 16% decline in our SG&A expense from a year ago.
Cyclical downturn continues to create uncertainty across all of the markets we serve, especially in relation to our shorter-cycle businesses. Broadly speaking, that uncertainty has caused demand to remain muted. Additionally, we continue to see pricing pressure across all of our business segments.
Onshore markets have continued to be weak in North America, but we are seeing some evidence that the cycle may be approaching a trough. One reason we say that is that we have seen a deceleration in the rate of order declines in our onshore North America businesses. Specifically, orders for North American onshore declined only 9% from Q1 to Q2 as compared to a roughly 40% decline from Q4 to Q1. As we've previously said, international markets have proved to be a bit more resilient, and we actually saw an uptick in new orders internationally from our Surface Systems businesses from Q1 to Q2.
When we look at the offshore markets, we continue to see demand for drilling products contract sharply when we compared to the year ago quarter. That said, we did see a sequential quarter uptick in our orders for our Drilling Systems business.
In our Subsea business, the story is much more positive this quarter, with orders up both sequentially and as compared to the year ago period. And while both timing and scope of deepwater production systems remains a question, our OneSubsea continues to see a healthy prospect list for Subsea processing awards. Strength of the prospect list in our OneSubsea joint venture is a reflection of the competitive advantages of our offering. And again, more broadly, as both producers and suppliers collaborate to lower capital cost, increased recovery and reduce the cost per barrel, we believe many of these projects should ultimately move forward.
Now to take a step back and think about the bigger picture for Cameron, we're very fortunate to have a diverse offering of products and services that allows us to participate in the broader markets, both onshore and offshore, that make up our customer spending. To put a finer point on it, this means that Cameron is poised to benefit regardless of which particular end market recovers first.
We're encouraged by what we think are early signs of moderation in the pace of the decline in customer spending. As we have said previously, in the current environment, we remain focused on the things that we can control: ongoing systemic reduction in our cost structure, excellence in execution, creating and maintaining strong customer relationships, growing our core platforms and steady investment in new technology. We believe this focus will ensure that the company generates long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
I will now turn over the discussion to Scott Rowe, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Scott?"

The organization did what it needed to do in this challenging environment. We made hard decisions. We moved quickly. We're doing what we need to do, and we did all of this while embracing our customers during this difficult time.
I'll let Chuck walk you through the details of our earnings, but I do want to talk a bit about Cameron's orders. The headline here is that on a consolidated basis, orders increased 15% sequentially. In our Subsea segment, orders were 32% above the first quarter of 2015, and the book-to-bill ratio for the Subsea segment was well above 1. Clearly, OneSubsea has maintained good momentum through this cyclical downturn. Second quarter accomplishments include a $330 million award for subsea production equipment for a project offshore North Africa; a front-end engineering design contract with Woodside for a proposed floating LNG development offshore Northwest Australia. The Woodside order is particularly exciting for us because it's the first contract we have won under the frame agreement we signed with them a year ago, and we expect more to come under this agreement. 
The signing of an alliance agreement with Subsea 7 to further round out the OneSubsea portfolio. The alliance will work closely with our clients to optimize the subsea production hardware and the subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines and drive cost-effective solutions for operators. This is a further link in the chain of our Pore to Process approach that aimed at reducing development cost for our customers and, as importantly, improving the recovery factor in deepwater developments.
Additionally, the signing of the agreement with Chevron to form a joint industry program to develop subsea technology for 20K applications. This is a natural migration of Cameron's high-pressure technology that we have already developed and deployed in our Drilling and Surface businesses.
And finally, as we're announcing today, a significant award within the quarter for a subsea boosting system in the Gulf of Mexico. We'll provide more details on this award in an upcoming press release.
Looking at our other segments, orders were also up on a sequential basis for Surface and Drilling by 5% and 23%, respectively. The increase in Surface was driven by international new equipment orders. The increase in Drilling was aided by gains in services and new equipment, including several jack-up orders. 
Orders in Valves & Measurement declined sequentially by about 5%, which is broadly reflective of what we are seeing in terms of overall demand.
In the execution front, our operations teams are performing well within the context of what is happening in this marketplace, with our customers and the competition. Specifically, we continue to execute our downturn playbook that we had put together last year, outlining a program to build better customer relations, develop technology for the future, optimize our internal processes and drive down our cost structure.
Let me cite a few examples on this. As the first playbook relates to customers, I will say that we are having the kinds of discussions today that we would never had a year ago, discussions that are much more collaborative and often coming much earlier in the life of the cycle of a project. Customers and suppliers are working together to eliminate some of the inefficiencies that crept into the business in the era of high oil prices. Many of our customer discussions are about finding specific ways to improve operational efficiencies and to improve the return on capital for their investments. Clearly, operators today realize that collaboration with suppliers has the potential to unlock new and creative approaches that will save money and generate returns in this market. Our ultimate objective in this discussion is an outcome that reduces cost for the customer while enabling Cameron to gain share and maintain margin, in other words, a win-win situation.
The playbook in relation to new technology is essentially this, a commitment to maintain our R&D spending throughout the cycle. We believe that technology spending is essential for us to retain our competitive advantages. We've seen some of these results with our recent accomplishments: first, the world's first gas compressor -- wet gas compressor for which we won an OTC Spotlight award; Mark IV High Availability Control POD for BOPs, which also won an OTC Spotlight award; the industry's first and only 13-5/8"" 25K blowout preventer and the first to market with a 25K surface production system; a joint technology program between OneSubsea and Helix to engineer and manufacture a 15K intervention riser system; as well as a 20K joint industry program with Chevron that I mentioned a moment ago.
The last element of our downturn playbook is our company-wide effort to reduce our fundamental cost structure. This effort started prior to the downturn and has helped us minimize the margin impact on our businesses. Essentially, we have taken a fresh look at everything we do and challenged ourselves to drive efficiency throughout our organization. As a practical matter, what this means is that we are streamlining internal processes and organizations. We're significantly reducing the cost structure of the organization through reorganization, improved processes and leveraging the entire Cameron enterprise. One visible example of this is the 16% reduction in our SG&A, as Jack cited earlier. We will continue to do what we need to do to rightsize our business in this environment while creating a scalable model that will allow us to grow profitably -- will allow us to grow more profitably than in past up-cycles when the recovery ultimately does come.
Again, overall market conditions are challenging, but we are seeing signs of activity stabilizing in North America, and that will help our onshore-focused businesses, which include Surface, Valves & Measurement and portions of our Drilling segment, recover relatively quickly once we see activity levels actually increase.
Our Subsea segment is making steady progress in demonstrating how we can help customers improve recoveries. For this reason, we reiterate our view that Subsea orders will be at or above 2014 order levels, with the back half of the year weighted to the fourth quarter.
We believe the breadth of our portfolio will allow us to take advantage of the marketplace despite the shape or style of the recovery. We remain committed to our multiyear margin improvement program, and we believe that our ability to generate solid results thus far during a tough market is a clear indication that we are on the right path.
On that note, I'll turn it over to Chuck."

Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter of this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments. Subsea was up 4% sequentially. Revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-",1087,"Thanks, Scott. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially flat with the first quarter of this year, reflecting a mixed pattern among our 4 segments. Subsea was up 4% sequentially. Revenues in drilling were basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Revenues in Surface and V&M were down sequentially about 6% and 11%, respectively. The good news is that the pace of the declines in our shorter-cycle components of Surface and V&M seem to be moderating.
EBIT margins before other costs were 12.1% for the quarter, which is 50 basis points higher when compared to the year quarter -- year ago quarter, down sequentially about 70 basis points. No surprise there as our Surface business reflects the level of North American activity declines. However, it appears that Surface margins may have bottomed in Q2. As both Jack and Scott mentioned, we've been working on fundamentally lowering our cost structure since early '14, and our second quarter results show further evidence of our progress in this regard.
Consolidated SG&A expense was down 16% versus year ago quarter and also modestly below the level of Q1. Operating EPS was $0.83, which is below the year ago quarter and below the first quarter of this year. That's no surprise given the market conditions. Excluding -- excluded from operating earnings are other costs amounting to $0.12 per share primarily for restructuring cost, devaluation of the Angolan currency and accelerated write-downs of underutilized assets. 
Now a few words about each segment. Subsea revenues declined from the levels of the year ago quarter due to the timing of project deliveries. That being said, revenues increased on a sequential basis as expected. Q1 represented the seasonal low point for Subsea revenues. Operating income margin came in at 10.2%, almost 400 basis points above the year ago quarter and also above Q1 due to improved execution and cost reduction. 
Surface revenues were down versus the year ago quarter and on a sequential quarter basis due largely to the weakness in the shorter-cycle North American market. The North American revenues for Surface, which accounted for -- which account for most of the shorter-cycle businesses, were down 41% from the year ago quarter and down 19% from the preceding quarter. Our international market actually grew on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The operating income margin for Surface was 13.5%. Q2 margin reflects continued weakness in activity levels in North America as well as pricing pressure. Operating income margin for Surface in Q2 was also negatively impacted by FX losses, which lowered the margin by 80 basis points. For sake of clarity, what I'm referring to as FX losses represent balance sheet remeasurement of our net monetary positions in that segment.
In Drilling, no surprise on the revenue front. Revenues were 6% below the level of a year ago but essentially flat sequentially. The decline in revenues versus the year ago quarter was driven by our shorter-cycle services businesses as the steep reduction activity levels have clearly affected our Drilling customers' spending patterns. The operating income margin in Drilling was 16.6%, which is almost 400 basis points above the year ago quarter and clearly shows the improved execution in this business. The Q2 margin was down on a sequential quarter basis due primarily to FX losses, which lowered Drilling's operating income margin by approximately 100 basis points.
In our V&M segment, revenues declined sharply in comparison to the year ago quarter and the first quarter '15. Again, this should come as no surprise to anyone given the weakness in the North American market. North American revenues for V&M, which represent most of its shorter-cycle businesses, were down about 19% as compared to the preceding quarter and 33% down from the year ago quarter. As Scott mentioned, we've begun to see signs that the North American portion of this business has begun to stabilize. Operating income margin in V&M was 11.5%, which is modestly up from the level of Q1 as expected. Net sequential quarter improvement is attributable to cost-reduction efforts. The Q2 margin was well below the level of a year ago, reflecting the impact of the de-stocking of distributor inventories in North America. Corporate expense declined by $15 million from year ago levels, reflecting our strategic shift to a lower-cost operating model. The company ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $1.7 billion and a net debt-to-cap ratio of 17%. Cameron's overall liquidity gives us significant flexibility to deal with the uncertainties presented by this down-cycle, execute on our strategic initiatives and position ourselves for growth.
Cameron's CapEx was $41 million in the second quarter as compared to $73 million in the second quarter '14. As of the end of the second quarter '15, approximately $285 million remained under our share repurchase program.
Now let's turn to outlook. Overall revenues in Q3 and 4 should hover around the levels of Q2. As far as overall EBIT margin goes, Q3 should remain around the level of Q2 before we see a slight uptick in Q4.
On that note, let's look at each of the 4 segments. In our Subsea segment, we expect to see revenues in the second half of '15 that are well above first half levels, with Subsea's operating income margin and the second half topping 10%. In our Surface segment, we are likely to see second half revenues that are somewhat lower than half 1. We believe that Q2 is likely to be the low point for Surface margins this year and could see slight increases for Q3 and 4. In our Drilling segment, second half revenues are likely to be moderately below half 1 levels, maybe around 10% lower. We think the operating income margin will increase in each of the remaining quarters and could approach 20% in Q4. In our Valves & Measurement segment, second half revenues are likely to be somewhat below half 1, with quarterly margins not varying materially from the level of Q2.
A few other '15 items to mention. Corporate expenses should be approximately $100 million for the year, which is $10 million lower than our previous guidance of $110 million. Interest expense should approximate $140 million, and our segment revenues should approximate $200 million. The corresponding amount of intercompany operating income to eliminate would be roughly $50 million. Our operating tax rate should approximate 23%. Our CapEx will be in the approximate range from $300 million to $350 million, and noncontrolling interest should be around $50 million.
With that, Scott, let's open up for questions."

Really, with the OneSubsea formation, right, we've always said we want to optimize the Pore to Process approach for deepwater developments. And really, this is just one link in the chain to do that, right? So originally, we brought the reservoir and the SPS together with Schlumberger and Cameron, then we went to life of field just because we saw tremendous opportunities in life of field, so we partnered with Helix who is leading that. And really, the focus there and the focus at the beginning was always around driving more out of deepwater development, so improving recovery rates and helping operators get more out of existing assets. And then now, today, in this environment where cost is really the largest focus, we do think there's opportunities between the SPS, right, the production system and the SURF equipment to drive cost down and improve the installability of what we're putting on the seafloor. So I think it's -- really, for us, it's a natural progression. Again, we've said from the beginning we really want to work on helping operators from Pore to Process, and this is a nice next step for us."

I think, again, thinking about Pore to Process and how do we help operators in this time.

But currently, the downstream segment is doing very well, and it's robust, and we've been able to grow that this year. We do see opportunities midstream internationally, and we ultimately believe that the rewiring in North America is not complete and that as activity does increase in North America, you see our Distributed Valves pick up quickly. Then also you get the midstream effect there as you're rewiring production to get from where that's developed to the refining basins."

And I'll just add that the beauty of OneSubsea, right, and having a partner like Schlumberger is we do have a team that really understands the reservoir and understands the flow aspects and flow assurance side of that. And we can have meaningful discussions with operators around what we think their developments can do and what the potential are on that. So we feel very good about that. When we think of deepwater versus onshore recovery rates, in the deepwater, the best wells are still in the teens to maybe 20%, whereas onshore, you're getting upwards of 30% to 50% recovery. So the goal is to convert deepwater wells and get them ultimately to look something like the onshore wells. We think we can do that by putting energy on the seafloor and being able to intervene in those wells on a regular basis to help stimulate production. So there's not one magic number. There's not a benchmark we talk about, but when we think and sit down with operators and really start to understand what their reservoir characteristics are, we ultimately think that we can improve their recovery rates, and we talk about different solutions to do that."

That's adjusted for all the risk factors and the macro environment with oil pricing and political or geographic and political risks. And so what we're doing is sitting down with teams with the IOCs and say, okay, well, let us look at this one, and maybe you've got a wrong assumption there on pump life or a different assumption on flow assurance and going back through all their assumptions that built their model and then also putting standardized solutions there that will drive costs down, putting energy on the seafloor and potentially changing the way the SPS looks like on the seafloor. Now with Subsea 7, right, we now have the ability to talk about the handover and the interfaces on the SURF side and the installability of that system.
