As we begin our call, I, as always, want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding customer service in 2014. Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financ",942,"Thank you, operator, and welcome to the year ending earnings call for GameStop. As we begin our call, I, as always, want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding customer service in 2014. Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, our EVP of Strategic Business and Brand Development; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.
In 2014, we saw many aspects of our strategic plan come to fruition, and I am very proud of the dedication and execution of our entire team. One of our goals was to maximize our brick-and-mortar stores and our NexGen video game hardware and software launches were dominant, as we delivered all-time high in market share of 28% on hardware and 46% on software. All the investment in PowerUp Rewards, unique content, execution and customer service paid off with this generation. We expect that to continue.
Non-GAAP digital receipts climbed 31% year-over-year and digital is a solid growth story for us. We delivered this year $948 million of digital revenues. If you go back and look at our 2010 investor day, we forecast $1.5 billion by 2015, and though we will not reach that target, our growth is comparable or ahead of most publishers. Rob will discuss our digital market share and our progress in that business with you.
Pre-owned showed growth of 2.6% in a declining software market and maintained healthy margins. You will recall that last year, we introduced the value category as our strategy to gain share in new games sold below $20 as well as growing our pre-owned category. I am pleased to report that our market share in this category grew by 2%, indicating that our buying to inventory out of the market and away from our competitors. Let me state once again that competitors who have entered the pre-owned market have not heard our market-leading position, but have helped create greater awareness among consumers.
Technology Brands had a spectacular year. On this strategy, I'm pleased to report that have exceeded our initial commitments laid out last year. After only 2 years, our Technology Brands strategy is producing real results, and we now expect that business to contribute over $1.4 billion in sales and $170 million in operating earnings by 2019. Our internal rate of return on acquisitions and new real estate exceeds our internal targets, and we believe we are the most productive dealer for both AT&T and Apple.
Our partnership with AT&T is particularly productive. After only 2 years, we are their second largest and fastest growing dealer and we have done multiple acquisitions in the past year. Our Cricket stores are also growing, although not as fast. Even our GameStop Technology Institute in Austin is partnered with AT&T's high-speed fiber connections, as you may have read about in the AT&T annual report.
Apple is also a great partner, and with the 3 acquisitions we have made, we are now their largest independent dealer. We believe there is a solid business model to place Simply Mac stores in secondary markets that do not have Apple retail and take share from existing big boxes.
The end result of this activity is a record high gross margin rate of 29.9%. In the last 7 years, we have increased our gross margin rate from 25.8% to 29.9%.
As many of you know, we recently completed our third investor survey in the last 5 years. One of the points of feedback that we got in that survey is that we need to set achievable financial targets. Rob will cover our guidance with you, but I wanted to point out in that spirit that given the way this console cycle has played out, modeling software growth has been challenging. For 2015, we have looked at every model available from analysts, software publishers and industry sources. Analyzing all of this information and comparing it with our internal data, our team has forecast our new software growth for 2015 at 4% to 6%, a number we believe to be realistic for our business.
The final pillar of our strategic plan is disciplined capital allocation. Outside of any investment opportunities that are more accretive then buybacks, we intend to return our free cash to shareholders. During 2014, we repurchased $330 million of stock and paid out $149 million in dividends. We currently have an authorization of $500 million on our share repurchase plan, and we recently increased our dividend by 9% to $1.44 per share.
As we look ahead to the future, we are excited. Our video game business has a solid growth rate, and we have been successful in building our market share, loyalty programs and reputation, which will serve as a springboard for our future growth. Our digital and tech plans initiatives give us great growth vehicles and our preowned business will always be a strong foundation.
Before I turn over to the team, I do want to make one important point. At GameStop, only one thing remains constant, our focus on the ongoing transformation of the company. At the heart of GameStop's evolution is a story of driving commitment to change, the relentless pursuit of innovation and the deep understanding of the consumer marketplace. One good example of our ongoing transformation is that nonphysical gaming products will represent 20% of our revenues this year. Mike Hogan has been running our business development process for several years and we have asked him to discuss this topic later in the call.
Thank you for your support of GameStop, and I will pass the call on to Rob."

Today, I'd like to take you through 4 major points. First, I will very briefly recap our results for fiscal 2014. Next, I'd like to discuss our 2015 guidance, focusing on software growth.

Next, I'd like to discuss our 2015 guidance, focusing on software growth. Third, I'll provide some information about digital from both a market and a GameStop perspective. And lastly, I will provide additional color and metrics on our Technology Brands segment.
So let's begin with the 2014 recap on Slide 2. Overall, results were in line with our expectations. Sales decreased 5.6% in the fourth quarter, but increased 2.8% for the year. Excluding FX, sales decreased to 2.8% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.4% for the year. Apple [indiscernible] sales declined 1.8% for the quarter, but increased 3.4% for the year. Gross margins expanded 50 basis points for the year, resulting in a 29.9% margin rate, which is our highest annual gross margin rate and the highest gross profit dollar we have achieved in our history.
Operating earnings increased 7.7% for the quarter and increased 7.8% for the year. Non-GAAP net income increased 5.9% for the quarter and 10.2% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS increased 13.2% for the quarter, despite a $0.05 negative impact from FX rates and increased 15.3% for the year despite an $0.08 negative impact from FX.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.6% for the year, up from 21% the prior year due to the growth of Tech Brands, which carries a higher SG&A rate.
Now let's look at sales for some of the categories on Slide 3. As expected, hardware declined 30.2% in the quarter with the top comp given the console launches in the same period last year, but hardware grew 17.3% for the year. Software grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter, but was down 11.3% for the year. We are now seeing NexGen software consistently exceed prior gen on a monthly basis, and it's great to note that we ended the year with our highest market share ever in hardware and software.
pre-owned revenue was down 1.7% in the quarter, but increased 1% excluding currency. pre-owned revenue grew 2.6% for the year despite the decline in new software and the effect of currency headwinds. pre-owned margin rates for the quarter were comparable to the prior year, and the full year we are up 100 basis points from 2013. As we close the fiscal year, we made an adjustment to GAAP digital revenues to convert Kongregate spread and mobile revenue from a [indiscernible] to commission basis with an impact of approximately $15 million.
We closed a net of 251 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened 266 Technology Brands stores. In 2014, we repurchased 333 million in stock or 8.4 million shares at an average price of $39.50, and we paid out $149 million in dividend. We generated free cash flow with $334 million, which was below our guidance range due primarily to the timing of payments associated with income taxes and other liabilities of approximately $60 million when comparing fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013. We also had increases in accounts receivable associated with the Tech Brands business of approximately $20 million.
The last thing I'd like to cover on 2014 is how the market performed relative to industry projections. As you can see on Slide 4, in 2014 in the North America and physical and digital console market was expected to total approximately $16.7 billion, implying about 13% growth over 2013.
Hardware exceeded expectations by about $500 million due to strong NexGen sales. Physical software fell short of expectations by about $800 million, which, as you can see, is entirely due to the fall off of the old gen. And digital fell a little short of growth expectations. In total, the console market grew 9% to $16 billion versus the 13% increase that had been predicted. What's important to note here is that the shortfall in physical software was caused by the fall off in old gen software sales but was not caused by a greater than expected shift to digital which came in below industry expectations.
Now, I'll move on to 2015 guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we are guiding the EPS ranging from $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2015, an increase of between 3% and 10%. Full year revenues are forecast to range between down 1% and positive 4%, with same-store sales ranging from positive 1% to 6%. We anticipate a foreign currency exchange impact of approximately $300 million to $400 million in sales and between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for fiscal 2015.
Looking at the first quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues to range from negative 2% to positive 1% and same-store sales of positive 2.5% to 5.5%. We expect earnings per share to be in a range between $0.53 and $0.60 per share. For purposes of your models, the average number of shares outstanding we used in our guidance is 109 million shares for the first quarter and the full year, as we do not assume any share buyback in our guidance. This is 2 million shares more than the consensus models, and that has an impact of approximately $0.07 per share for the year. We project free cash flow for fiscal 2015 to range between $400 million and $500 million, with the largest variable being the number of Technology Brand stores and the CapEx and receivables to support that.
The next slide shows you the major puts and takes of sales in 2015. Foreign currency exchange impacts could essentially wipe out all of our comp store sales gains expected for the year.
I'll let you go off the slide for a minute. We compared our revenue expectations by category for 2015 to the average of the analysts' models. We are fairly consistent with the exception of new software growth. We are estimating new software growth in 2015 to be between 4% and 6% based on our current visibility into the title lineup. The consensus estimate for new software growth is over 11%, which we believe is overly optimistic. Last year, we shared with you our projection that the console market would grow 10% to 15% in 2015. The decline in old gen software in 2014 occurred faster than we or the market expected and following those results, we project declines in old gen hardware and software of more than 50% in 2015. We see moderate growth in new gen hardware over 50% growth in new gen software and growth in digital of more than 10%.
Moving on with some greater depth on digital. Based on all of the sources we had used over the last couple of years to build the market model, we believe DSE Intelligence is the leading third-party resource in the console digital space. This Spring, DSE will be publishing some insightful data on what happened in the digital market in 2014. We have some of that data that we can reveal today. The number one digital complement to address is the adoption rate the full game downloads. Slide 7 shows some key statistics based on DSE data, which analyzes the AAA games sold in 2014. You can see that DSC estimates that of the total number of AAA video games sold last year, 12% were downloaded and 88% were physical. Of the 12% downloaded, it is estimated that 60% were given away in hardware bundles. That means about 5% of AAA titles were downloads but were actually paid for by consumers. DSE estimates that full game downloads of AAA titles paid for by consumers made up only 2% of the total physical and digital software market. DSC also provided us some data on the estimates of the DLC market for 2014. Overlaying our DLC sales on to DSC's estimate of market shares, we calculate that we have approximately 42% of the market, in line with our overall software share. Hopefully, on our next call, we can take DSC's published data and our data and provide even greater clarity. Now let's move on to a discussion about Technology Brands.
Slide 8 it shows our performance in technology transfer fiscal '14. As you can see, revenues totaled $329 million. Operating earnings were $33 million, with an operating margin of 10%. Tech Brands added $0.19 to earnings per share. We believe this was an incredibly successful first full year with 5% of our consolidated operating margin coming from a new segment.
The next slide shows the average internal rate of return target for the Tech Brands store we opened or acquired in 2014. As you can see, we acquired 16 dealers with a combined targeted IRR of 23%. We opened 123 white space stores with a combined IRR of 27%. Between acquisitions and new stores, our aggregate targeted IRR is 24%. As we seek new white space stores or new acquisitions, the minimum targeted hurdle rate is 20%. Keep in mind our weighted average cost of capital is 10.6%. As I've said in the past, our targeted IRR is far in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. The potential RadioShack stores, which we are negotiating, have a pro forma IRR of 25%. The performance of our new and acquired tech brands stores in 2014 was very strong, as they outperformed their pro formas by 114%. This is due to our ability to drive productivity and customer conversions, particularly in stores we acquire from other resellers. We are projecting growth of 350 to 550 Technology Brands stores to 2015 to include white space stores, acquisitions and conversions of GameStop stores.
The last slide provides updated guidance on where we see the Tech Brands business growing in the next 5 years. As you can see, and as Paul mentioned, we believe we can grow this business to over $1.4 billion in revenues by the end of 2019 and almost $170 million in operating earnings. The CAGRs demonstrate robust growth for several years.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

Good afternoon. Very exciting time for GameStop at this stage of the console cycle as we continue to do dominate the video game market around the world, grow our differentiated position and market share and branch into exciting areas that leverage our retail and digital expertise. The focus of my comments today will be on the current console software environment, our plans to continued growth in our digital business and the expansion of Technology Brands.
To date, this has been a strong launch, and GameStop has gained on every front as compared to the last launch. The PS4 Xbox One category hardware unit sales are 56% higher than PS3 Xbox 360 over the same period of time following the launch. GameStop has gained significant hardware share with our unit sales up 145%.
In software, we have a commanding 46% market share of PS4 Xbox One software with unit sales of 92% over the last launch cycle. And so far in 2015, we continue to dominate the new generation of software with our Xbox One and PS4 software market share at 52%, up 440 basis points over the same time frame in 2014.
We believe that new software sales were impacted in the latter part of 2014, as many games were given away as subsidized marketing incentives in next-generation hardware bundles. According to NPD, these 3 digital games reduced the total physical next-generation software market by $250 million. We also believe, based on our discussions with publishers and platform holders, that these pack and programs will be significantly reduced in 2015.
We're excited about the innovation that are coming to the new consoles in 2015. Key titles include the just launched Battlefield Hard Line from Electronic Arts, the soon to be launched Mortal Kombat X and Batman Arkham Knight from Warner Bros., Man, FIFA and Star Wars Battlefront from Electronic arts, Halo 5 from Microsoft and Call of Duty's next installment from Activision.
We leverage our close relationship for the publishers to drive differentiation. For instance, 2 weeks ago, we had a very successful launch of Battlefield hard-line. Working closely with EA, we provided each U.S. associate with the opportunity to play the actual game 4 days prior to its launch. They were able to share their experience through both social media and with our customers during the weekend and during the crucial midnight opening. Clearly, we have the most informed associates on the night of the launch. In terms of our pre-owned business, it returned to growth in 2014, and we expect it to accelerate in 2015 driven by new software growth. As the NexGen cycle takes hold, we are seeing more of our pre-owned sales shift into PS4 and Xbox One. Additionally, as publishers continue to transition from legacy to new, it positions GameStop as the destination location for older games and systems.
In addition, we continue to drive new forms of payment to make GameStop the most simple and affordable place for gamer's favorite technology. In addition to the PowerUp rewards credit card, which has generated over $225 million of credits so far, we also added Apple Pay and a gift card exchange program to provide customers with even more ways to afford the technology that they want.
Turning to our digital business. We matched the growth of our publishing partners by generating $948 million of digital receipts at a growth rate of 31%. Key digital drivers continue to be our dominant share of downloadable content, digital sales of full game downloads, our sale of subscriptions and points cards, Digital Game Informer and our fast-growing steam PC download business. Our important enrollment in digital value chain is a discovery and affordability of digital content, and we've spoken often about our success regarding digital adoption with our customers. As Rob mentioned, based on data from DSC Intelligence, we had a 42% market share in 2014 of all of the downloadable add-on contents sold. We accomplished this because our knowledgeable associates, many of whom have actually played the downloadable add-on content, helped customers discover and purchase this very content.
We expect to provide a similar benefit for full game downloads, both the AAA games and for indie games. We are a key player in the digital value chain and we have plans in place to be full participants in all facets of digital gaming similar to what we have done in add-on downloadable content.
And in mobile, our Kongregate service continues to publish profitable mobile games. We expect to publish 15 to 20 games this year and grow our mobile revenue by 80%. It's important to note that 2 of our most important digital initiatives, our mobile and PC publishing and our digital magazine, Game Informer, are led by 2 of the most influential women of gaming, Emily Graer, the cofounder of Kongregate, and Cathy Preston, the publisher of Game Informer.
Finally, as Rob shared, we are very pleased with the returns that were getting on our Technology Brands businesses. We have close, exclusive relationships with AT&T and Apple that allows us to participate in consumer-friendly offering such as the next program in our Spring Mobile stores and iPhone warranty replacement in our Simply Mac stores. These partners also offset a portion of our construction cost. The growth of 350 to 550 stores that Rob talked about will come from 4 main sources. First, white space development. Working with AT&T and Apple, we have identified sites that will support the new AT&T, Cricket or Simply Mac store and we are leveraging our real estate expertise to identify and procure the best growth state available.
Second, mergers and acquisitions. Working closely with our partners, we continue to look at opportunities to acquire new stores. On average, we see at least a 30% increase in productivity and acquire stores through stronger execution.
Third, GameStop real estate conversions. As we continue to rationalize the GameStop asset base, we are identifying locations where we can convert GameStop real estate into AT&T, Cricket or Simply Mac locations. We target stores that we can transfer significant sales to nearby GameStop locations. This is our most profitable asset move and we plan on executing 70 to 100 of these conversions this year.
Finally, RadioShack conversions. We procured 163 leases from the RadioShack bankruptcy trust and we are currently in the process of converting most of these leases into AT&T stores. We were very selective in picking the top stores that had great lease terms, strong visibility and can work consistent with our partners' needs. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Hogan for his comments."

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our business development process in the areas in which we continue to explore new growth opportunities. We initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new prospects that could leverage 4 GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value.
GameStop has been the unquestioned leader in gaming for many years, but we are successfully expanding our influence to become a family of specialty retail brands that make the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Our early efforts were primarily focused on expansion into digital gaming and produced opportunities such as the acquisition of Kongregate, which continues to perform very well for us.
Since our acquisition in 2010, Kongregate revenue has grown at a 75% compound annual growth rate. Kongregate has launched a number of successful mobile games such as Tyrant, Game of Thrones and Adventure Capitalist and PowerUp Rewards has proven instrumental in driving awareness and customer acquisition.
This is in addition to our internally developed opportunities such as the sale of downloadable content in our stores and on gamestop.com. As Tony mentioned, GameStop now has an estimated 42% share for downloadable content sales.
In recent years, we have expanded our focus to include a broader array of adjacent categories in which we believe our core competencies of real estate, consumer relationships, retail execution, buy-sell-trade and disciplined capital allocation can be brought to bear. Our biggest recent success was the formation and expansion of our Technology Brands business unit, which includes our AT&T wireless, Cricket and Simply Mac stores. The businesses leverage core GameStop competencies and in return have given us new leadership such as Jason Ellis and Steve Bain and category expertise in wireless and in Apple retail. As we have discussed, this business unit is projected to reach $1.5 billion of sales by 2019.
We remain focused on exploring and exploiting new opportunities with significant total addressable markets that provide growth and leverage our strengths. For example, the wireless category roughly $185 billion in the U.S., we are now one of AT&T's largest and most productive dealers. The Apple product's ecosystem, which exceeds $50 billion in the U.S., we are now the #1 Apple specialist retailer. And most recently, the market for video game, movie and pop culture licensed merchandise which is estimated to be over $20 billion worldwide, we see it as a great opportunity to offer a wider array of attractive products to our PowerUp members, both in-store and online. We expect to quickly become the market leader here as well as we utilize our brand, store footprint, multichannel selling capabilities and PowerUp Rewards. We will provide updates on this initiative throughout the year.
Our efforts to date have offered significant, new, diversified platforms for GameStop. It is worth noting that in 2014, our business outside physical video games totaled $1.6 billion or approximately 16% of total revenue, and we expect it to grow to at least $2 billion or more than 20% of revenue in 2015.
We are very pleased with the progress today and are investing in these platforms to drive continued growth, but we are actively seeking additional growth platforms as well. We are exploring acquisition and partnership opportunities that leverage GameStop's core competencies and provide great value and growth for our shareholders both in the U.S. and in our international markets.
Finally, a few quick thoughts on PowerUp Rewards. PowerUp membership grew 13% in 2014 and is now over 30 million members in the U.S. International membership grew 30% and is now 10.7 million members. PowerUp represents 74% of total spend and on average, members spend 3x more than nonmembers. Average annual spend per member grew 5% to $323 per year in 2014. We continue to expand and innovate to enhance the appeal for our members. One example is our PowerUp Rewards credit card which was launched last fall. Today, we have been able to grant over $225 million of new credit to our members, which will support new purchases such as the growth of next-generation hardware and software.
I will now turn it back over to Paul."

So when we look at the attach rates, we will typically attack about 30% to 40% of add-on downloadable content to a title when it launches, and that tends to be fairly consistent, regardless of genre. There are obviously some price point differences, so if you have downloadable content at a higher price, you get a slightly lower attach rate, but essentially, it's a very strong attach rate.

And were you to seek contribution -- or where do you see contribution from this segment over the mid to longer term?

It's September 2013 when we first engaged with the Spring Mobile and AT&T, we've expanded the door count from 90 to 361. So it's really the hyper growth pace. And are very productive year of AT&T and they see us not only as one of the largest and the fastest growing, but we're also one of the most productive and consistently scored as one of the highest, if not the highest in customer service ranking. So that's allowed us to have an opportunity to help them consolidate the market. As we've mentioned earlier, we did 16 acquisitions, and on average, when we do an acquisition, we see a 30% increase in the business which is obviously good for us and good for AT&T. And I think you asked about markets where we were helping AT&T enter into where they may not be, and we've opened 123 stores and really white space areas like metro locations and secondary markets. And then from a long-term growth perspective, I think Rob, you mentioned that we're going from $33 million of operating earnings to $170 million in 2019.

As the learnings from the PC digital side that you asked about, what we see right now what we see is incredible increase taking place in the PC side, as people are coming in to the -- as people are coming into the business. I think it's important to remember that on the PC side business, historically, it's always been DRM limitations that have a significant restriction on pre-owned. And so you really didn't have the residual value that you do on the console side of the business. So I think that that's one important thing that you have to realize about the console side of the business is that, that $20 residual is in the mind of the customer is really an important piece of the business."

We're speaking in terms of dollars. And you may think about it -- that we have to overcome the price point on the Xbox One for the entire of the year relative to where it's not in November I think of last year, and pretty much held there through the fourth quarter. So that would imply a slightly larger increase in units for that. And again, we don't forecast any sort of price declines on hardware until we absolutely know something and we don't know anything right now. So you asked about 2016 Tech Brands targets, and what I would say to you is at the beginning of last year, when we laid out our 2016 goals for tech brands with respect to revenue, we were in very early days of the next program. And as we discussed in the past, the next program, as Paul just mentioned it a few minutes ago changes the dynamics of how we recognize revenue. So I would think intense more of what we talked about today on a long-term basis, that almost $1.5 billion in revenue by the end of '19. And I would say to you that, that is formed base upon how the programs work today and they move around. For us, what we're more focused on is the operating profit. And we'll see that growth as we go from the $33 million that we did this year up to the target that we laid out for you for '19. I'd rather not specifically say how that might have changed to target we previously laid out for '16. Candidly I don't have that information in front of me."

As we begin our call, I, as always, want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding customer service in 2014. Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financ",946,"Thank you, operator, and welcome to the year ending earnings call for GameStop. As we begin our call, I, as always, want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding customer service in 2014. Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, our EVP of Strategic Business and Brand Development; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.
In 2014, we saw many aspects of our strategic plan come to fruition, and I am very proud of the dedication and execution of our entire team. One of our goals was to maximize our brick-and-mortar stores and our next gen video game hardware and software launches were dominant, as we delivered all-time high market share of 28% on hardware and 46% on software. All the investment in PowerUp Rewards, unique content, execution and customer service paid off with this generation. We expect that to continue.
Non-GAAP digital receipts climbed 31% year-over-year and digital is a solid growth story for us. We delivered this year $948 million of digital revenues. If you go back and look at our 2010 Investor Day, we forecast $1.5 billion by 2015, and though we will not reach that target, our growth is comparable or ahead of most publishers. Rob will discuss our digital market share and our progress in that business with you.
Pre-owned showed growth of 2.6% in a declining software market and maintained healthy margins. You will recall that last year, we introduced the value category as our strategy to gain share in new games sold below $20 as well as growing our pre-owned category. I am pleased to report that our market share in this category grew by 2%, indicating that our buying took inventory out of the market and away from our competitors. Let me state once again that competitors who have entered the pre-owned market have not heard our market-leading position, but have helped create greater awareness among consumers.
Technology Brands had a spectacular year. On this strategy, I am pleased to report that we have exceeded our initial commitments laid out last year. After only 2 years, our Technology Brands strategy is producing real results, and we now expect that business to contribute over $1.4 billion in sales and $170 million in operating earnings by 2019. Our internal rate of return on acquisitions and new real estate exceeds our internal targets, and we believe we are the most productive dealer for both AT&T and Apple.
Our partnership with AT&T is particularly productive. After only 2 years, we are their second largest and fastest growing dealer and we have done multiple acquisitions in the past year. Our Cricket stores are also growing, although not as fast. Even our GameStop Technology Institute in Austin is partnered with AT&T on high-speed fiber connections, as you may have read about in the AT&T annual report.
Apple is also a great partner, and with the 3 acquisitions we have made, we are now their largest independent dealer. We believe there is a solid business model to place Simply Mac stores in secondary markets that do not have Apple retail and take share from existing big boxes.
The end result of all this activity is a record high gross margin rate of 29.9%. In the last 7 years, we have increased our gross margin rate from 25.8% to 29.9%.
As many of you know, we recently completed our third investor survey in the last 5 years. One of the points of feedback that we got in that survey is that we need to set achievable financial targets. Rob will cover our guidance with you, but I wanted to point out in that spirit that given the way this console cycle has played out, modeling software growth has been challenging. For 2015, we have looked at every model available from analysts, software publishers and industry sources. Analyzing all of this information and comparing it with our internal data, our team has forecast our new software growth for 2015 at 4% to 6%, a number we believe to be realistic for our business.
The final pillar of our strategic plan is disciplined capital allocation. Outside of any investment opportunities that are more accretive than buybacks, we intend to return our free cash to shareholders. During 2014, we repurchased $333 million of stock and paid out $149 million in dividends. We currently have an authorization of $500 million on our share repurchase plan, and we recently increased our dividend by 9% to $1.44 per share.
As we look ahead to the future, we are excited. Our video game business has a solid growth rate, and we have been successful in building our market share, loyalty programs and reputation, which will serve as a springboard for our future growth. Our digital and Tech Brands initiatives give us great growth vehicles and our pre-owned business will always be a strong foundation.
Before I turn it over to the team, I want to make one important point. At GameStop, only one thing remains constant, our focus on the ongoing transformation of the company. At the heart of GameStop's evolution is a story of driving commitment to change, the relentless pursuit of innovation and the deep understanding of the consumer marketplace. One good example of our ongoing transformation is that nonphysical gaming products will represent 20% of our revenues this year. Mike Hogan has been running our business development process for several years and we have asked him to discuss this topic later in the call.
Thank you for your support of GameStop, and I will pass the call on to Rob."

Today, I'd like to take you through 4 major points. First, I will very briefly recap our results for fiscal 2014. Next, I'd like to discuss our 2015 guidance, focusing on software growth.

Next, I'd like to discuss our 2015 guidance, focusing on software growth. Third, I'll provide some information about digital from both a market and a GameStop perspective. And lastly, I will provide additional color and metrics on our Technology Brands segment.
So let's begin with the 2014 recap on Slide 2. Overall results were in line with our expectations. Sales decreased 5.6% in the fourth quarter but increased 2.8% for the year. Excluding FX, sales decreased 2.8% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.3% for the year. Apple store sales declined 1.8% for the quarter but increased 3.4% for the year. Gross margins expanded 50 basis points for the year, resulting in a 29.9% margin rate, which is our highest annual gross margin rate and the highest gross profit dollars we've achieved in our history.
Operating earnings increased 7.7% for the quarter and increased 7.8% for the year. Non-GAAP net income increased 5.9% for the quarter and 10.2% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS increased 13.2% for the quarter, despite a $0.05 negative impact from FX rates, and increased 15.3% for the year, despite an $0.08 negative impact from FX.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.6% for the year, up from 21% the prior year due to the growth of Tech Brands, which carries a higher SG&A rate.
Now let's look at sales for some of the categories on Slide 3. As expected, hardware declined 30.2% in the quarter with a tough comp, given the console launches in the same period last year, but hardware grew 17.3% for the year. Software grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter but was down 11.3% for the year. We are now seeing next gen software consistently exceed prior gen on a monthly basis, and it's great to note that we ended the year with our highest market share ever in hardware and software.
Pre-owned revenue was down 1.7% in the quarter but increased 1% excluding currency. Pre-owned revenue grew 2.6% for the year despite the decline in new software and the effect of currency headwinds. Pre-owned margin rates for the quarter were comparable to the prior year and the full year, were up 100 basis points from 2013. As we close the fiscal year, we made an adjustment to GAAP digital revenues to convert Kongregate spread and mobile revenue from a growth to a commission basis with an impact of approximately $15 million.
We closed a net of 251 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened 266 Technology Brands stores. In 2014, we repurchased $333 million in stock or 8.4 million shares at an average price of $39.50, and we paid out $149 million in dividends. We generated free cash flow of $334 million, which was below our guidance range due primarily to the timing of payments associated with income taxes and other liabilities of approximately $60 million when comparing fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013. We also had increases in accounts receivable associated with the Tech Brands business of approximately $20 million.
The last thing I'd like to cover on 2014 is how the market performed relative to industry projections. As you can see on Slide 4, in 2014, the North American physical and digital console market was expected to total approximately $16.7 billion, implying about 13% growth over 2013.
Hardware exceeded expectations by about $500 million due to strong next gen sales. Physical software fell short of expectations by about $800 million, which, as you can see, is entirely due to the fall off of the old gen. And digital fell a little short of growth expectations. In total, the console market grew 9% to $16 billion versus the 13% increase that had been predicted. What's important to note here is that the shortfall in physical software was caused by the fall off in old gen software sales but was not caused by a greater-than-expected shift to digital which came in below industry expectations.
Now I'll move on to 2015 guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we are guiding the EPS ranging from $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2015, an increase of between 3% and 10%. Full year revenues are forecast to range between down 1% and positive 4%, with same-store sales ranging from positive 1% to 6%. We anticipate a foreign currency exchange impact of approximately $300 million to $400 million in sales and between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for fiscal 2015.
Looking at the first quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues to range from negative 2% to positive 1% and same-store sales of positive 2.5% to 5.5%. We expect earnings per share to be in a range between $0.53 and $0.60 per share. For purposes of your models, the average number of shares outstanding we used in our guidance is 109 million shares for the first quarter and the full year, as we do not assume any share buyback in our guidance. This is 2 million shares more than the consensus models, and that has an impact of approximately $0.07 per share for the year. We project free cash flow for fiscal 2015 to range between $400 million and $500 million, with the largest variable being the number of Technology Brands stores and the CapEx and receivables to support that.
The next slide shows you the major puts and takes of sales in 2015. Foreign currency exchange impacts could essentially wipe out all of our comp store sales gains expected for the year.
Let me go off the slide for a minute. We've compared our revenue expectations by category for 2015 to the average of the analysts' models. We are fairly consistent, with the exception of new software growth. We are estimating new software growth in 2015 to be between 4% and 6% based on our current visibility into the title lineup. The consensus estimate for new software growth is over 11%, which we believe is overly optimistic. Last year, we shared with you our projection that the console market would grow 10% to 15% in 2015. The decline in old gen software in 2014 occurred faster than we or the market expected, and following those results, we project declines in old gen hardware and software of more than 50% in 2015. We see moderate growth in new gen hardware, over 50% growth in new gen software and growth in digital of more than 10%.
Moving on to some greater depth on digital. Based on all of the sources we had used over the last couple of years to build the market model, we believe DFC Intelligence is the leading third-party resource in the console digital space. This spring, DFC will be publishing some insightful data on what happened in the digital market in 2014. We have some of that data that we can reveal today. The number one digital component to address is the adoption rate of full game downloads. Slide 7 shows some key statistics based on DFC data, which analyzes the AAA games sold in 2014. You can see that DFC estimates that of the total number of AAA video games sold last year, 12% were downloaded and 88% were physical. Of the 12% downloaded, it is estimated that 60% were given away in hardware bundles. That means about 5% of AAA titles were downloads but were actually paid for by consumers. DFC estimates that full game downloads of AAA titles paid for by consumers made up only 2% of the total physical and digital software market. DFC also provided us some data on their estimate of the DLC market for 2014. Overlaying our DLC sales on to DFC's estimate of market sales, we calculate that we had approximately 42% of the market, in line with our overall software share. Hopefully, on our next call, we can take DFC's published data and our data and provide even greater clarity. Now let's move on to a discussion about Technology Brands.
Slide 8 shows our performance in Technology Brands for fiscal '14. As you can see, revenues totaled $329 million. Operating earnings were $33 million, with an operating margin of 10%. Tech Brands added $0.19 to earnings per share. We believe this was an incredibly successful first full year, with 5% of our consolidated operating margin coming from a new segment.
The next slide shows the average internal rate of return target for the Tech Brands stores we opened or acquired in 2014. As you can see, we acquired 16 dealers with a combined targeted IRR of 23%. We opened 123 white space stores, with a combined IRR of 27%. Between acquisitions and new stores, our aggregate targeted IRR is 24%. As we seek new white space stores or new acquisitions, the minimum targeted hurdle rate is 20%. Keep in mind our weighted average cost of capital is 10.6%. As I've said in the past, our targeted IRR is far in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. The potential RadioShack stores, which we are negotiating, have a pro forma IRR of 25%. The performance of our new and acquired Tech Brands stores in 2014 was very strong, as they outperformed their pro formas by 114%. This is due to our ability to drive productivity and customer conversions, particularly in stores we acquire from other resellers. We are projecting growth of 350 to 550 Technology Brands stores in 2015 to include white space stores, acquisitions and conversions of GameStop stores.
The last slide provides updated guidance on where we see the Tech Brands business growing in the next 5 years. As you can see and as Paul mentioned, we believe we can grow this business to over $1.4 billion in revenues by the end of 2019 and almost $170 million in operating earnings. The CAGRs demonstrate robust growth for several years.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

Good afternoon. It's a very exciting time for GameStop at this stage of the console cycle as we continue to dominate the video game market around the world, grow our differentiated position and market share and branch into exciting areas that leverage our retail and digital expertise. The focus of my comments today will be on the current console software environment, our plans to continue growth in our digital business and the expansion of Technology Brands.
To date, this has been a strong launch, and GameStop has gained on every front as compared to the last launch. The PS4-Xbox One category hardware unit sales are 56% higher than PS3-Xbox 360 over the same period of time following the launch. GameStop has gained significant hardware share with our unit sales up 145%.
In software, we have a commanding 46% market share of PS4-Xbox One software, with unit sales up 92% over the last launch cycle. And so far in 2015, we continue to dominate the new generation of software with our Xbox One and PS4 software market share at 52%, up 440 basis points over the same time frame in 2014.
We believe that new software sales were impacted in the latter part of 2014, as many games were given away as subsidized marketing incentives in next-generation hardware bundles. According to NPD, these free digital games reduced the total physical next-generation software market by $250 million. We also believe, based on our discussions with publishers and platform holders, that these tuck-in programs will be significantly reduced in 2015.
We're excited about the innovation that's coming to the new consoles in 2015. Key titles include the just launched Battlefield Hardline from Electronic Arts, the soon to be launched Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight from Warner Bros., Madden, FIFA and Star Wars Battlefront from Electronic Arts, Halo 5 from Microsoft and Call of Duty's next installment from Activision.
We leverage our close relationships with the publishers to drive differentiation. For instance, 2 weeks ago, we had a very successful launch of Battlefield Hardline. Working closely with EA, we provided each U.S. associate with the opportunity to play the actual game 4 days prior to its launch. They were able to share their experience through both social media and with our customers during the weekend and during the crucial midnight opening. Clearly, we have the most informed associates on the night of the launch. In terms of our pre-owned business, it returned to growth in 2014, and we expect it to accelerate in 2015 driven by new software growth. As the next gen cycle takes hold, we are seeing more of our pre-owned sales shift into PS4 and Xbox One. Additionally, as publishers continue to transition from legacy to new, it positions GameStop as the destination location for older games and systems.
In addition, we continue to drive new forms of payment to make GameStop the most simple and affordable place for gamers' favorite technology. In addition to the PowerUp Rewards credit card, which has generated over $225 million of credits so far, we've also added Apple Pay and a gift card exchange program to provide customers with even more ways to afford the technology that they want.
Turning to our digital business. We matched the growth of our publishing partners by generating $948 million of digital receipts at a growth rate of 31%. Key digital drivers continue to be our dominant share of downloadable content, digital sales of full game downloads, our sale of subscriptions and points cards, Digital Game Informer and our fast-growing Steam PC download business. Our important role in the digital value chain is the discovery and affordability of digital content, and we have spoken often about our success in driving digital adoption with our customers. As Rob mentioned, based on data from DFC Intelligence, we had a 42% market share in 2014 of all of the downloadable add-on contents sold. We accomplished this because our knowledgeable associates, many of whom have actually played the downloadable add-on content, helped customers discover and purchase this great content.
We expect to provide a similar benefit for full game downloads, both for AAA games and for indie games. We are a key player in the digital value chain and we have plans in place to be full participants in all facets of digital gaming, similar to what we have done in add-on downloadable content.
And in mobile, our Kongregate service continues to publish profitable mobile games. We expect to publish 15 to 20 games this year and grow our mobile revenue by 80%. It's important to note that 2 of our most important digital initiatives, our mobile and PC publishing and our digital magazine, Game Informer, are led by 2 of the most influential women in gaming, Emily Greer, the cofounder of Kongregate, and Cathy Preston, the publisher of Game Informer.
Finally, as Rob shared, we are very pleased with the returns that we are getting on our Technology Brands businesses. We have close, exclusive relationships with AT&T and Apple that allow us to participate in consumer-friendly offering such as the next program in our Spring Mobile stores and iPhone warranty replacement in our Simply Mac stores. These partners also offset a portion of our construction cost. The growth of 350 to 550 stores that Rob talked about will come from 4 main sources. First, white space development. Working with AT&T and Apple, we have identified sites that will support a new AT&T, Cricket or Simply Mac store, and we are leveraging our real estate expertise to identify and procure the best real estate available.
Second, mergers and acquisitions. Working closely with our partners, we continue to look at opportunities to acquire new stores. On average, we see at least a 30% increase in productivity in acquired stores through stronger execution.
Third, GameStop real estate conversions. As we continue to rationalize the GameStop asset base, we are identifying locations where we can convert GameStop real estate into AT&T, Cricket or Simply Mac locations. We target stores that we can transfer significant sales to nearby GameStop locations. This is our most profitable asset move and we plan on executing 70 to 100 of these conversions this year.
Finally, RadioShack conversions. We procured 163 leases from the RadioShack bankruptcy trust and we are currently in the process of converting most of these leases into AT&T stores. We were very selective in picking the top stores that had great lease terms, strong visibility and were consistent with our partners' needs.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Hogan for his comments."

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our business development process and the areas in which we continue to explore new growth opportunities. We initiated a robust business development process a number of years a",702,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Paul asked me to comment briefly on our business development process and the areas in which we continue to explore new growth opportunities. We initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new prospects that could leverage core GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value.
GameStop has been the unquestioned leader in gaming for many years, but we are successfully expanding our influence to become a family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Our early efforts were primarily focused on expansion into digital gaming and produced opportunities such as the acquisition of Kongregate, which continues to perform very well for us.
Since our acquisition in 2010, Kongregate revenue has grown at a 75% compound annual growth rate. Kongregate has launched a number of successful mobile games such as Tyrant, Game of Thrones and Adventure Capitalist, and PowerUp Rewards has proven instrumental in driving awareness and customer acquisition.
This is in addition to our internally developed opportunities such as the sale of downloadable content in our stores and on gamestop.com. As Tony mentioned, GameStop now has an estimated 42% share for downloadable content sales.
In recent years, we have expanded our focus to include a broader array of adjacent categories in which we believe our core competencies of real estate, consumer relationships, retail execution, buy-sell-trade and disciplined capital allocation can be brought to bear. Our biggest recent success was the formation and expansion of our Technology Brands business unit, which includes our AT&T Wireless, Cricket and Simply Mac stores. These businesses leverage core GameStop competencies and in return, have given us new leadership such as Jason Ellis and Steve Bain and category expertise in wireless and in Apple retail. As we have discussed, this business unit is projected to reach $1.5 billion of sales by 2019.
We remain focused on exploring and exploiting new opportunities with significant total addressable markets that provide growth and leverage our strengths. For example, the wireless category, roughly $185 billion in the U.S., we are now one of AT&T's largest and most productive dealers. The Apple product's ecosystem, which exceeds $50 billion in the U.S., we are now the #1 Apple specialist retailer. And most recently, the market for video game, movie and pop culture licensed merchandise, which is estimated to be over $20 billion worldwide, we see it as a great opportunity to offer a wider array of attractive products to our PowerUp members, both in-store and online. We expect to quickly become the market leader here as well as we utilize our brand, store footprint, multichannel selling capabilities and PowerUp Rewards. We will provide updates on this initiative throughout the year.
Our efforts to date have delivered significant, new, diversified growth platforms for GameStop. It is worth noting that in 2014, our business outside physical video games totaled $1.6 billion or approximately 16% of total revenue, and we expect it to grow to at least $2 billion or more than 20% of revenue in 2015.
We are very pleased with the progress today and are investing in these platforms to drive continued growth, but we are actively seeking additional growth platforms as well. We are exploring acquisition and partnership opportunities that leverage GameStop's core competencies and provide great value and growth for our shareholders both in the U.S. and in our international markets.
Finally, a few quick thoughts on PowerUp Rewards. PowerUp membership grew 13% in 2014 and is now over 30 million members in the U.S. International membership grew 30% and is now 10.7 million members. PowerUp represents 74% of total spend and on average, members spend 3x more than nonmembers. Average annual spend per member grew 5% to $323 per year in 2014. We continue to expand and innovate to enhance the appeal for our members. One example is our PowerUp Rewards credit card, which is launched last fall. To date, we've been able to grant over $225 million of new credit to our members, which will support new purchases such as the growth of next-generation hardware and software.
I will now turn it back over to Paul."

So when we look at attach rates, we will typically attach about 30% to 40% of add-on downloadable content to a title when it launches, and that tends to be fairly consistent, regardless of genre. There are obviously some price point differences, so if you have downloadable content at a higher price, you get a slightly lower attach rate, but essentially, it's a very strong attach rate. And again, that really is our associates who are selling that at the time of launch that drives our 42% market share."

I was wondering if I could touch upon some of the increased efforts you folks have had been placing on additional product distribution capabilities and opportunities. Specifically, it seems that phone distribution has picked up momentum, largely due to your partnership with AT&T including the Cricket brand. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on the pace of the business, the specific drivers for growth. For example, are you seeing an opportunity to work with AT&T in consolidating their distribution strategy, tapping additional markets where they may not have an active footprint? And were you to seek contribution from -- or where do you expect to see contribution from this segment over the mid to longer term? And then as a second question, AT&T seems to be on the verge of closing a pretty large transaction with DIRECTV. Should that deal happen, hypothetically, what type of additional opportunities could you see with a new product segment, given your partnership with the carrier?"

Since September 2013, when we first engaged with Spring Mobile and AT&T, we've expanded the store -- the door count from 90 to 361. So it's really the hyper growth pace. And we're a very productive dealer for AT&T and they see us that way. Not only are we one of the largest and the fastest growing, but we're also one of the most productive and consistently scored as one of the highest, if not the highest, in customer service ranking. So that's allowed us to have an opportunity to help them consolidate the market. As we've mentioned earlier, we did 16 acquisitions, and on average, when we do an acquisition, we see a 30% increase in the business which is obviously good for us and good for AT&T. And I think you asked about markets where we were helping AT&T enter into where they may not be, and we've opened 123 stores in really true white space areas like metro locations and secondary markets. And then from a long-term growth perspective, I think, Rob, you mentioned that we're going from $33 million of operating earnings to $170 million in 2019.

And again, we don't forecast any sort of price declines on hardware until we absolutely know something and we don't know anything right now. So you asked about 2016 Tech Brands targets, and what I would say to you is at the beginning of last year, when we laid out our 2016 goals for Tech Brands with respect to revenue, we were in very early days of the next program. And as we've discussed in the past, the next program, Paul just mentioned it a few minutes ago, changes the dynamics of how we recognize revenue. So I would think in terms more of what we talked about today on a long-term basis, that's that almost $1.5 billion in revenue by the end of '19. And I would say to you that, that is formed based upon how the programs work today and they move around. For us, what we're more focused on is the operating profit. And we'll see that growth as we go from the $33 million that we did this year up to the target that we laid out for you for '19.

As we begin our call, I, as always, want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding customer service in 2014.

As we begin our call, I, as always, want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding customer service in 2014. Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, our EVP of Strategic Business and Brand Development; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.
In 2014, we saw many aspects of our strategic plan come to fruition, and I am very proud of the dedication and execution of our entire team. One of our goals was to maximize our brick-and-mortar stores and our next gen video game hardware and software launches were dominant, as we delivered all-time high market share of 28% on hardware and 46% on software. All the investment in PowerUp Rewards, unique content, execution and customer service paid off with this generation. We expect that to continue.
Non-GAAP digital receipts climbed 31% year-over-year and digital is a solid growth story for us. We delivered this year $948 million of digital revenues. If you go back and look at our 2010 Investor Day, we forecast $1.5 billion by 2015, and though we will not reach that target, our growth is comparable or ahead of most publishers. Rob will discuss our digital market share and our progress in that business with you.
Pre-owned showed growth of 2.6% in a declining software market and maintained healthy margins. You will recall that last year, we introduced the value category as our strategy to gain share in new games sold below $20 as well as growing our pre-owned category. I am pleased to report that our market share in this category grew by 2%, indicating that our buying took inventory out of the market and away from our competitors. Let me state once again that competitors who have entered the pre-owned market have not hurt our market-leading position, but have helped create greater awareness among consumers.
Technology Brands had a spectacular year. On this strategy, I am pleased to report that we have exceeded our initial commitments laid out last year. After only 2 years, our Technology Brands strategy is producing real results, and we now expect that business to contribute over $1.4 billion in sales and $170 million in operating earnings by 2019. Our internal rate of return on acquisitions and new real estate exceeds our internal targets, and we believe we are the most productive dealer for both AT&T and Apple.
Our partnership with AT&T is particularly productive. After only 2 years, we are their second largest and fastest growing dealer and we have done multiple acquisitions in the past year. Our Cricket stores are also growing, although not as fast. Even our GameStop Technology Institute in Austin is partnered with AT&T on high-speed fiber connections, as you may have read about in the AT&T annual report.
Apple is also a great partner, and with the 3 acquisitions we have made, we are now their largest independent dealer. We believe there is a solid business model to place Simply Mac stores in secondary markets that do not have Apple retail and take share from existing big boxes.
The end result of all this activity is a record high gross margin rate of 29.9%. In the last 7 years, we have increased our gross margin rate from 25.8% to 29.9%.
As many of you know, we recently completed our third investor survey in the last 5 years. One of the points of feedback that we got in that survey is that we need to set achievable financial targets. Rob will cover our guidance with you, but I wanted to point out in that spirit that given the way this console cycle has played out, modeling software growth has been challenging. For 2015, we have looked at every model available from analysts, software publishers and industry sources. Analyzing all of this information and comparing it with our internal data, our team has forecast our new software growth for 2015 at 4% to 6%, a number we believe to be realistic for our business.
The final pillar of our strategic plan is disciplined capital allocation. Outside of any investment opportunities that are more accretive than buybacks, we intend to return our free cash to shareholders. During 2014, we repurchased $333 million of stock and paid out $149 million in dividends. We currently have an authorization of $500 million on our share repurchase plan, and we recently increased our dividend by 9% to $1.44 per share.
As we look ahead to the future, we are excited. Our video game business has a solid growth rate, and we have been successful in building our market share, loyalty programs and reputation, which will serve as a springboard for our future growth. Our digital and Tech Brands initiatives give us great growth vehicles and our pre-owned business will always be a strong foundation.
Before I turn it over to the team, I want to make one important point. At GameStop, only one thing remains constant: our focus on the ongoing transformation of the company. At the heart of GameStop's evolution is a story of driving commitment to change, the relentless pursuit of innovation and the deep understanding of the consumer marketplace. One good example of our ongoing transformation is that nonphysical gaming products will represent 20% of our revenues this year. Mike Hogan has been running our business development process for several years and we have asked him to discuss this topic later in the call.
Thank you for your support of GameStop, and I will pass the call on to Rob."

Today, I'd like to take you through 4 major points. First, I will very briefly recap our results for fiscal 2014. Next, I'd like to discuss our 2015 guidance, focusing on software growth.

Next, I'd like to discuss our 2015 guidance, focusing on software growth. Third, I'll provide some information about digital from both a market and a GameStop perspective. And lastly, I will provide additional color and metrics on our Technology Brands segment.
So let's begin with the 2014 recap on Slide 2. Overall results were in line with our expectations. Sales decreased 5.6% in the fourth quarter but increased 2.8% for the year. Excluding FX, sales decreased 2.8% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.3% for the year. Comparable store sales declined 1.8% for the quarter but increased 3.4% for the year. Gross margins expanded 50 basis points for the year, resulting in a 29.9% margin rate, which is our highest annual gross margin rate and the highest gross profit dollars we've achieved in our history.
Operating earnings increased 7.7% for the quarter and increased 7.8% for the year. Non-GAAP net income increased 5.9% for the quarter and 10.2% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS increased 13.2% for the quarter, despite a $0.05 negative impact from FX rates, and increased 15.3% for the year, despite an $0.08 negative impact from FX.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.6% for the year, up from 21% the prior year due to the growth of Tech Brands, which carries a higher SG&A rate.
Now let's look at sales for some of the categories on Slide 3. As expected, hardware declined 30.2% in the quarter with a tough comp, given the console launches in the same period last year, but hardware grew 17.3% for the year. Software grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter but was down 11.3% for the year. We are now seeing next gen software consistently exceed prior gen on a monthly basis, and it's great to note that we ended the year with our highest market share ever in hardware and software.
Pre-owned revenue was down 1.7% in the quarter but increased 1% excluding currency. Pre-owned revenue grew 2.6% for the year despite the decline in new software and the effect of currency headwinds. Pre-owned margin rates for the quarter were comparable to the prior year and the full year, were up 100 basis points from 2013. As we close the fiscal year, we made an adjustment to GAAP digital revenues to convert Kongregate Kred and mobile revenue from a [indiscernible] to a commission basis with an impact of approximately $15 million.
We closed a net of 251 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened 266 Technology Brands stores. In 2014, we repurchased $333 million in stock or 8.4 million shares at an average price of $39.50, and we paid out $149 million in dividends. We generated free cash flow of $334 million, which was below our guidance range due primarily to the timing of payments associated with income taxes and other liabilities of approximately $60 million when comparing fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013. We also had increases in accounts receivable associated with the Tech Brands business of approximately $20 million.
The last thing I'd like to cover on 2014 is how the market performed relative to industry projections. As you can see on Slide 4, in 2014, the North American physical and digital console market was expected to total approximately $16.7 billion, implying about 13% growth over 2013.
Hardware exceeded expectations by about $500 million due to strong next gen sales. Physical software fell short of expectations by about $800 million, which, as you can see, is entirely due to the fall off of the old gen. And digital fell a little short of growth expectations. In total, the console market grew 9% to $16 billion versus the 13% increase that had been predicted. What's important to note here is that the shortfall in physical software was caused by the fall off in old gen software sales but was not caused by a greater-than-expected shift to digital which came in below industry expectations.
Now I'll move on to 2015 guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we are guiding the EPS ranging from $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2015, an increase of between 3% and 10%. Full year revenues are forecast to range between down 1% and positive 4%, with same-store sales ranging from positive 1% to 6%. We anticipate a foreign currency exchange impact of approximately $300 million to $400 million in sales and between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for fiscal 2015.
Looking at the first quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues to range from negative 2% to positive 1% and same-store sales of positive 2.5% to 5.5%. We expect earnings per share to be in a range between $0.53 and $0.60 per share. For purposes of your models, the average number of shares outstanding we used in our guidance is 109 million shares for the first quarter and the full year, as we do not assume any share buyback in our guidance. This is 2 million shares more than the consensus models, and that has an impact of approximately $0.07 per share for the year. We project free cash flow for fiscal 2015 to range between $400 million and $500 million, with the largest variable being the number of Technology Brands stores and the CapEx and receivables to support that [ph].
The next slide shows you the major puts and takes of sales in 2015. Foreign currency exchange impacts could essentially wipe out all of our comp store sales gains expected for the year.
Let me go off the slide for a minute. We've compared our revenue expectations by category for 2015 to the average of the analysts' models. We are fairly consistent, with the exception of new software growth. We are estimating new software growth in 2015 to be between 4% and 6% based on our current visibility into the title lineup. The consensus estimate for new software growth is over 11%, which we believe is overly optimistic. Last year, we shared with you our projection that the console market would grow 10% to 15% in 2015. The decline in old gen software in 2014 occurred faster than we or the market expected, and following those results, we project declines in old gen hardware and software of more than 50% in 2015. We see moderate growth in new gen hardware, over 50% growth in new gen software and growth in digital of more than 10%.
Moving on to some greater depth on digital. Based on all of the sources we had used over the last couple of years to build the market model, we believe DFC Intelligence is the leading third-party resource in the console digital space. This spring, DFC will be publishing some insightful data on what happened in the digital market in 2014. We have some of that data that we can reveal today. The number one digital component to address is the adoption rate of full game downloads. Slide 7 shows some key statistics based on DFC data, which analyzes the AAA games sold in 2014. You can see that DFC estimates that of the total number of AAA video games sold last year, 12% were downloaded and 88% were physical. Of the 12% downloaded, it is estimated that 60% were given away in hardware bundles. That means about 5% of AAA titles were downloads but were actually paid for by consumers. 
DFC estimates that full game downloads of AAA titles paid for by consumers made up only 2% of the total physical and digital software market. DFC also provided us some data on their estimate of the DLC market for 2014. Overlaying our DLC sales on to DFC's estimate of market sales, we calculate that we had approximately 42% of the market, in line with our overall software share. Hopefully, on our next call, we can take DFC's published data and our data and provide even greater clarity. Now let's move on to a discussion about Technology Brands.
Slide 8 shows our performance in Technology Brands for fiscal '14. As you can see, revenues totaled $329 million. Operating earnings were $33 million, with an operating margin of 10%. Tech Brands added $0.19 to earnings per share. We believe this was an incredibly successful first full year, with 5% of our consolidated operating margin coming from a new segment.
The next slide shows the average internal rate of return target for the Tech Brands stores we opened or acquired in 2014. As you can see, we acquired 16 dealers with a combined targeted IRR of 23%. We opened 123 white space stores, with a combined IRR of 27%. Between acquisitions and new stores, our aggregate targeted IRR is 24%. As we seek new white space stores or new acquisitions, the minimum targeted hurdle rate is 20%. Keep in mind our weighted average cost of capital is 10.6%. As I've said in the past, our targeted IRR is far in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. The potential RadioShack stores, which we are negotiating, have a pro forma IRR of 25%. 
The performance of our new and acquired Tech Brands stores in 2014 was very strong, as they outperformed their pro formas by 114%. This is due to our ability to drive productivity and customer conversions, particularly in stores we acquire from other resellers. We are projecting growth of 350 to 550 Technology Brands stores in 2015 to include white space stores, acquisitions and conversions of GameStop stores.
The last slide provides updated guidance on where we see the Tech Brands business growing in the next 5 years. As you can see and as Paul mentioned, we believe we can grow this business to over $1.4 billion in revenues by the end of 2019 and almost $170 million in operating earnings. The CAGRs demonstrate robust growth for several years.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

Good afternoon. It's a very exciting time for GameStop at this stage of the console cycle as we continue to dominate the video game market around the world, grow our differentiated position and market share and branch into exciting areas that leverage our retail and digital expertise. The focus of my comments today will be on the current console software environment, our plans to continue growth in our digital business and the expansion of Technology Brands.
To date, this has been a strong launch, and GameStop has gained on every front as compared to the last launch. The PS4-Xbox One category hardware unit sales are 56% higher than PS3-Xbox 360 over the same period of time following the launch. GameStop has gained significant hardware share with our unit sales up 145%.
In software, we have a commanding 46% market share of PS4-Xbox One software, with unit sales up 92% over the last launch cycle. And so far in 2015, we continue to dominate the new generation of software with our Xbox One and PS4 software market share at 52%, up 440 basis points over the same time frame in 2014.
We believe that new software sales were impacted in the latter part of 2014, as many games were given away as subsidized marketing incentives in next-generation hardware bundles. According to NPD, these free digital games reduced the total physical next-generation software market by $250 million. We also believe, based on our discussions with publishers and platform holders, that these pack-in programs will be significantly reduced in 2015.
We're excited about the innovation that's coming to the new consoles in 2015. Key titles include the just launched Battlefield Hardline from Electronic Arts, the soon to be launched Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight from Warner Bros., Madden, FIFA and Star Wars Battlefront from Electronic Arts, Halo 5 from Microsoft and Call of Duty's next installment from Activision.
We leverage our close relationships with the publishers to drive differentiation. For instance, 2 weeks ago, we had a very successful launch of Battlefield Hardline. Working closely with EA, we provided each U.S. associate with the opportunity to play the actual game 4 days prior to its launch. They were able to share their experience through both social media and with our customers during the weekend and during the crucial midnight opening. Clearly, we have the most informed associates on the night of the launch. In terms of our pre-owned business, it returned to growth in 2014, and we expect it to accelerate in 2015 driven by new software growth. As the next gen cycle takes hold, we are seeing more of our pre-owned sales shift into PS4 and Xbox One. Additionally, as publishers continue to transition from legacy to new, it positions GameStop as the destination location for older games and systems.
In addition, we continue to drive new forms of payment to make GameStop the most simple and affordable place for gamers' favorite technology. In addition to the PowerUp Rewards credit card, which has generated over $225 million of credit so far, we've also added Apple Pay and a gift card exchange program to provide customers with even more ways to afford the technology that they want.
Turning to our digital business. We matched the growth of our publishing partners by generating $948 million of digital receipts at a growth rate of 31%. Key digital drivers continue to be our dominant share of downloadable content, digital sales of full game downloads, our sale of subscriptions and points cards, Digital Game Informer and our fast-growing Steam PC download business. 
Our important role in the digital value chain is the discovery and affordability of digital content, and we have spoken often about our success in driving digital adoption with our customers. As Rob mentioned, based on data from DFC Intelligence, we had a 42% market share in 2014 of all of the downloadable add-on contents sold. We accomplished this because our knowledgeable associates, many of whom have actually played the downloadable add-on content, helped customers discover and purchase this great content.
We expect to provide a similar benefit for full game downloads, both for AAA games and for indie games. We are a key player in the digital value chain and we have plans in place to be full participants in all facets of digital gaming, similar to what we have done in add-on downloadable content.
And in mobile, our Kongregate service continues to publish profitable mobile games. We expect to publish 15 to 20 games this year and grow our mobile revenue by 80%. It's important to note that 2 of our most important digital initiatives, our mobile and PC publishing and our digital magazine, Game Informer, are led by 2 of the most influential women in gaming, Emily Greer, the cofounder of Kongregate, and Cathy Preston, the publisher of Game Informer.
Finally, as Rob shared, we are very pleased with the returns that we are getting on our Technology Brands businesses. We have close, exclusive relationships with AT&T and Apple that allow us to participate in consumer-friendly offering such as the next program in our Spring Mobile stores and iPhone warranty replacement in our Simply Mac stores. These partners also offset a portion of our construction cost. The growth of 350 to 550 stores that Rob talked about will come from 4 main sources: First, white space development. Working with AT&T and Apple, we have identified sites that will support a new AT&T, Cricket or Simply Mac store, and we are leveraging our real estate expertise to identify and procure the best real estate available.
Second, mergers and acquisitions. Working closely with our partners, we continue to look at opportunities to acquire new stores. On average, we see at least a 30% increase in productivity in acquired stores through stronger execution.
Third, GameStop real estate conversions. As we continue to rationalize the GameStop asset base, we are identifying locations where we can convert GameStop real estate into AT&T, Cricket or Simply Mac locations. We target stores that we can transfer significant sales to nearby GameStop locations. This is our most profitable asset move and we plan on executing 70 to 100 of these conversions this year.
Finally, RadioShack conversions. We procured 163 leases from the RadioShack bankruptcy trust and we are currently in the process of converting most of these leases into AT&T stores. We were very selective in picking the top stores that had great lease terms, strong visibility and were consistent with our partners' needs.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Hogan for his comments."

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our business development process and the areas in which we continue to explore new growth opportunities. We initiated a robust business development process a number of years a",703,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Paul asked me to comment briefly on our business development process and the areas in which we continue to explore new growth opportunities. We initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new prospects that could leverage core GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value.
GameStop has been the unquestioned leader in gaming for many years, but we are successfully expanding our influence to become a family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Our early efforts were primarily focused on expansion into digital gaming and produced opportunities such as the acquisition of Kongregate, which continues to perform very well for us.
Since our acquisition in 2010, Kongregate revenue has grown at a 75% compound annual growth rate. Kongregate has launched a number of successful mobile games such as Tyrant, Game of Thrones and Adventure Capitalist, and PowerUp Rewards has proven instrumental in driving awareness and customer acquisition.
This is in addition to our internally developed opportunities such as the sale of downloadable content in our stores and on gamestop.com. As Tony mentioned, GameStop now has an estimated 42% share for downloadable content sales.
In recent years, we have expanded our focus to include a broader array of adjacent categories in which we believe our core competencies of real estate, consumer relationships, retail execution, buy-sell-trade and disciplined capital allocation can be brought to bear. Our biggest recent success was the formation and expansion of our Technology Brands business unit, which includes our AT&T Wireless, Cricket and Simply Mac stores. These businesses leverage core GameStop competencies and in return, have given us new leadership such as Jason Ellis and Steve Bain and category expertise in wireless and in Apple retail. As we have discussed, this business unit is projected to reach $1.5 billion of sales by 2019.
We remain focused on exploring and exploiting new opportunities with significant total addressable markets that provide growth and leverage our strengths. For example, the wireless category, roughly $185 billion in the U.S., we are now one of AT&T's largest and most productive dealers. The Apple product's ecosystem, which exceeds $50 billion in the U.S., we are now the #1 Apple specialist retailer. And most recently, the market for video game, movie and pop culture licensed merchandise, which is estimated to be over $20 billion worldwide, we see it as a great opportunity to offer a wider array of attractive products to our PowerUp members, both in-store and online. We expect to quickly become the market leader here as well as we utilize our brand, store footprint, multichannel selling capabilities and PowerUp Rewards. We will provide updates on this initiative throughout the year.
Our efforts to date have delivered significant, new, diversified growth platforms for GameStop. It is worth noting that in 2014, our business outside physical video games totaled $1.6 billion or approximately 16% of total revenue, and we expect it to grow to at least $2 billion or more than 20% of revenue in 2015.
We are very pleased with the progress to date and are investing in these platforms to drive continued growth, but we are actively seeking additional growth platforms as well. We are exploring acquisition and partnership opportunities that leverage GameStop's core competencies and provide great value and growth for our shareholders both in the U.S. and in our international markets.
Finally, a few quick thoughts on PowerUp Rewards. PowerUp membership grew 13% in 2014 and is now over 30 million members in the U.S. International membership grew 30% and is now 10.7 million members.

So when we look at attach rates, we will typically attach about 30% to 40% of add-on downloadable content to a title when it launches, and that tends to be fairly consistent, regardless of genre. There are obviously some price point differences, so if you have downloadable content at a higher price, you get a slightly lower attach rate, but essentially, it's a very strong attach rate.

I was wondering if I could touch upon some of the increased efforts you folks have had been placing on additional product distribution capabilities and opportunities.

I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on the pace of the business, the specific drivers for growth. For example, are you seeing an opportunity to work with AT&T in consolidating their distribution strategy, tapping additional markets where they may not have an active footprint? And were you to seek contribution from -- or where do you expect to see contribution from this segment over the mid- to longer term?

Not only are we one of the largest and the fastest growing, but we're also one of the most productive and consistently score as one of the highest, if not the highest, in customer service ranking. So that's allowed us to have an opportunity to help them consolidate the market. As we've mentioned earlier, we did 16 acquisitions, and on average, when we do an acquisition, we see a 30% increase in the business which is obviously good for us and good for AT&T. And I think you asked about markets where we were helping AT&T enter into where they may not be, and we've opened 123 stores in really true white space areas like metro locations and secondary markets.

I think it's important to remember that on the PC side of the business, historically, there's always been DRM limitations that have had a significant restriction on pre-owned. And so you really didn't have the residual value that you do in the console side of the business.

So that would imply a slightly larger increase in units for that. And again, we don't forecast any sort of price declines on hardware until we absolutely know something and we don't know anything right now. So you asked about 2016 Tech Brands targets, and what I would say to you is at the beginning of last year, when we laid out our 2016 goals for Tech Brands with respect to revenue, we were in very early days of the next program. And as we've discussed in the past, the next program, Paul just mentioned it a few minutes ago, changes the dynamics of how we recognize revenue. So I would think in terms more of what we talked about today on a long-term basis, that's that almost $1.5 billion in revenue by the end of '19. And I would say to you that, that is formed based upon how the programs work today and they move around. For us, what we're more focused on is the operating profit. And we'll see that growth as we go from the $33 million that we did this year up to the target that we laid out for you for '19. I'd rather not specifically say how that might have changed the target we previously laid out for '16. Candidly, I don't have that information in front of me."

We always start our call the same way, but let me just thank every single associate in our organization for extraordinary service and execution this quarter. This was a great quarter, and GameStop once again demonstrated that we will protect our family of associates, customers and investors going forward.
I want to welcome our cast of characters here today: Tony Bartel, our Chief Operating Officer; Rob Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Mauler, our President of International; Mike Hogan, our Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development; Mike , our President of U.S. Stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor and Public Relations.
Let me say it again: what a quarter, comps of 8.6%, new software growth of 9.6% and earnings per share growth of 15%.
Starting with core. I couldn't be prouder of our associates in stores and net associates around the world as GameStop grow market share to record levels. The base model of reserving games, providing unique content and trade currency and delivering midnight launches continues to differentiate us in the market. Digital growth was also tremendous at 17.2%, led by DLC, mobile and Steam cards. The big idea of offering every customer add-on digital content for their physical games continues to play well with publishers and gamers around the world. We are also seeing great growth at our Kongregate unit on mobile games and are targeting 12 games for publishing this year.
business had flattish growth with very high margins. As you know, new software took tech a little longer to grow last year as we overlapped the decline of old gen. A similar phenomenon is happening in our pre-owned business with next-gen pre-owned showing great growth as old gen declines. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the year excluding currency, and Tony Bartel will share details with you on our core business.
The Technology Brands business continues to make great strides. Jason Ellis and his team are up to 549 stores, and all 3 divisions continue to receive accolades from AT&T and Apple. We are very important to both AT&T and Apple as an extension of their brands and provider of new services and products.
As you know, we are heavily involved in the review of RadioShack real estate, and we are very active in the M&A markets with dealers across the country.
One of the most gratifying pieces of our success in Tech Brands is that we have accomplished a lot of growth while maintaining a very high rate of quality and a lower churn rate. Going back to our earliest conversations with AT&T and Apple, we made a commitment to grow the business, but only while we maintain a very high quality level of service and in-store experience, and we are accomplishing that. Tony will also share with you some color on Tech Brands.
Another piece of the business that is officially launching this year is our collectibles and licensed merchandise category, which gamers refer to as loot. We have learned a great deal about this fast-growing popular consumer segment from our Australian colleagues, who have been piloting the business model for 2 years. You may have noted that we have rolled collectibles sections in all our stores, with some receiving broader exposures than others. I have to salute our global merchandising team of Stockwell and Egan Still in Austria, Michael Vanderburg in Europe European and Bob in the United States for coming together to make this effort happen so quickly. You will see that we can effectively merchandise a video game and popular culture merchandise in our stores, along with game or show launches. Mike Mauler will give you color on collectibles and licensed merchandise, but we expect that business to grow to $500 million within 3 years, and it is off to a great start.
Our capital allocation strategy remains disciplined. We bought back over $46 million of stock this quarter at about $39 per share and expect to repurchase at least $200 million over the course of fiscal 2015. We will also pay a dividend of $1.44 this year, a healthy 3.6% yield before the call started, one of the highest in consumer retail.  As you know, we sought some debt last fall to fund our Tech Brands acquisition efforts, and our capital formula will remain disciplined and consistent. 
Guidance for the second quarter is from flat to mid-teens growth, and we increased our annual guidance by the share count reduction achieved through the shares we purchased during the first quarter. We learned in our investors survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so. Rob Lloyd will give you more color on our results and expectations.
It is interesting, when we first started talking about driving a highway of internal change here at GameStop a few years ago, we had no idea how rapidly our external space would change. The good news is that we have persevered and today find ourselves with an abundance of good business opportunities as we build a portfolio of specialty retail brands to take your affordable technologies affordable and simple. 
Here are a few key strategy points to remember about GameStop. 
We will continue to innovate and expand share in our growing videogame business, and publishers of all kinds are participating in that process.  We created the digital process for selling DLC Steam cards, full game downloads, Kongregate mobile publishing and many others. We will continue to create and innovate in the digital category to serve our customers.
PowerUp Rewards is a foundational backbone to the business at 40 million members. 
Technology Brands is a strong partnership with AT&T and Apple, and we can continue to be successful only to the extent that we serve their needs. 
New categories, like collectibles and others upcoming, will continue. 
We are very active in the M&A space as we continue to diversify the company, and our capital allocation will continue to be disciplined.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rob."

I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter. Here are the highlights. 
Overall results exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 3.2% in the quarter, driven by next-gen software growth. Comparable store sales increased 8.6%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 300 basis points. 
Gross margins declined 40 basis points on the strength of 10% new software growth and the resulting shift in sales mix.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, down from 24.1% in the prior year quarter due to leveraging the sales growth.
Operating earnings increased 17% for the quarter on the strength of our sales results. 
Interest expense increased $4.8 million due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. 
Net income increased 8.5%, and EPS increased 15.3%.
Foreign currency moves cost nearly $100 million in sales, but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales increased 400 basis points in the quarter, but increased 5.1% excluding FX because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and handheld units. 
Software sales grew 9.6%, or 15.8% excluding FX, driven by our market-leading position on strong new titles such as Mortal Kombat X, Battlefield Hard Line and Dying Light. 
Preowned revenue was down 3.4%, but actually increased 0.8% excluding FX. A 49.1% pre-owned margin rate for the quarter were 140 basis points higher than Q4 and comparable to the prior year quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 17.2%, or 23.3% excluding FX, to over 220 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC to Evolve and Mortal Kombat. GAAP digital revenues declined 18% year-over-year due to FX impact and because we now account for Kongregate on a commission basis Compared to a gross receipt basis in Q1 of last year.
Mobile revenues increased 33.9%, which is attributed to the 70% growth in our Technology Brands revenues, while the margins for the quarter increased due to margins -- margin improvements in Technology Brands from 36.2% in Q1 last year to 39.8%.
Tech Brands revenues totaled $102.2 million, up 70% from the first quarter of last year, and we ended the quarter with 549 Spring Mobile and Simply Mac stores. Tech Brands operating income was $3.1 million, which was down from $6 million a year ago due to added infrastructure costs of approximately $4 million to prepare for opening roughly 200 new stores over this coming summer. The number of store openings in the next 3 months is 4x the highest number of stores we had opened in any previous quarter, and we needed to hire and train store personnel and field management in order to ensure successful openings. These added infrastructure costs will also impact the second quarter. 
Some other data points are as follows. We closed a net of 40 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened a net of 65 Technology Brand stores. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $46.4 million in stock or 1.19 million shares at an average price of $39.03. And we paid the first quarter dividend at $0.36 per share.
Now I'd like to discuss second quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to be flat to positive 3% and revenues to range from a decline of 3% to flat year-over-year. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the second quarter of last year.
We expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically during the second quarter. The industry and GameStop will be comping Mario Kart 8 and Watch Dogs in May. On the other hand, Batman Knight in June does not have a significant comparison from last year. There are no major titles expected in July to compare to the Last of Us for next gen from last July.  Due to our over-indexing in market share on new titles, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the second quarter as the 2 biggest titles, 3 and Batman Knight, are not expected to sell through as many units as the 2 biggest titles of Q2 2014, Watch Dogs and Mario Kart.  According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Watch Dogs and Mario Kart were sold in the second quarter of last year. Our share of that helped drive a 16% increase in new software and 22% comps for us in the second quarter of 2014.  
Despite this decline, we still expect higher operating earnings compared to the prior year quarter due to the strength in other areas of our business.  We are guiding EPS for our second quarter to range from $0.21 to $0.25 per share. 
We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the second quarter of last year. And we will have approximately $0.03 per share in interest expense. 
You should model 108 million shares outstanding for the second quarter and 108.2 million shares outstanding for the full year based on buyback through the end of the second quarter.
After considering buybacks we've completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share to a higher range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

As Rob and Paul have already shared, Q1 was a strong quarter for GameStop and showed the power of our diversification efforts. We achieved a record Q1 market share, gained share in digital, met our pre-owned expectations and grew Technology Brands, all while maintaining high customer satisfaction levels.  
We remain focused on being the premier video game destination. And we drove 360 basis points of total video game market share growth during the quarter.  We increased our Xbox One and PS4 software share by 420 basis points to 54% and our new-gen hardware share by 260 basis points to 38.5%.  On a combined basis, GameStop sold 46% of all Xbox One and PS4 hardware and software combined during the quarter, up 610 basis points from last year.
We continue to gain share in a new cycle that is significantly outpacing previous launches. The month of April was even more impressive in the quarter as we captured 47.6 of all software sold. We sold 57% of all Xbox One and PS4 software during the month and nearly half of all the new gen hardware and software combined.
Our promotion that we recently ran show the power of our unique value proposition. During the month of April, we partnered with Microsoft to run a promotion where customers could buy a new Xbox One console for $275 with a trade-in of either a PS3 or an Xbox 360 console. We nearly doubled our Xbox One market share during the month, but more importantly, GameStop drove 2/3 of the 63% industry growth that Xbox One experienced during the month. We are providing unprecedented value that is fueling this cycle's growth.
We also gained share in digital receipts as we grew 17.2% after the impact of FX to outpace aggregate growth of our top 4 publishing partners. In the U.S., we grew 22.7% and we grew international 24.9% excluding FX. GameStop's full game AAA downloads more than tripled, and our downloadable content increased by 83% during the quarter. Based on information from BSa Intelligence, full game AAA digital downloads represented 3% of the total software market in the first quarter, and that specific segment was 40% smaller than the downloadable content category.  Games and catalog games are bigger than these categories combined, and we are developing plans that we will share on future calls to increase our shares in this important category. 
As we noted in our fourth quarter release, we are seeing far fewer digital tokens packed in the hardware, and we do not expect significant digital pack-ins for the balance of the year.
Kongregate continues to expand its mobile publishing efforts, increasing mobile revenue by 37% during the quarter and exceeding 40 million mobile game installs live to date. We are on track to launch 12 games this year.
Turning to pre-owned sales. Our growth of 4.8% excluding FX met our expectations as our pre-owned sales have a higher mix declining prior-gen software than our new business .  As you can see on Slide 7 in supplemental data provided on our website, our pre-owned business is outpacing our new business in both software categories, new gen and prior gen, besting new gen growth by 31 points and prior gen decline by 38 points. However, because we still have a higher mix of prior gen, our overall pre-owned growth is 13 points behind our new software growth.  As our new gen pre-owned inventory growth continues to build, we expect our full year pre-owned growth rate to be mid-single digits.
Finally, our Technology Brand division continues to expand. Our end-of-quarter store count of 549 stores is more than double our count at the end of Q1 2014. As Rob indicated, we are investing for significant growth over the summer when we plan to open approximately 200 stores. These stores are a combination of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and white space stores. In addition, we continue to be active in the acquisition market.  Technology Brands stores that have been open more than a year are growing earnings at a strong double-digit pace, and this gives us confidence to continue to invest in this fast growth concept. 
We are currently the largest and fastest growing Apple authorized reseller, the second largest and fastest growing AT&T authorized dealer and a top 5 Cricket dealer.  As impressive as that growth is, what is even more impressive is our ability to quickly ramp these businesses while still maintaining a high level of customer service. We are the most productive dealer in the AT&T network and remain in the top tier of all Apple authorized resellers. Our in the next program is driving traffic growth. The strength of our relationship with AT&T and Apple has allowed us to quickly become large national dealers in their respective networks as we continue to expand our retail footprint in a high service manner.
These relationships also provide us with opportunities to drive even growth. Our AT&T stores are ready to sell future AT&T products and services, and we are also assessing our GameStop stores for the services as well. And over 50% of the traffic that we receive at our Simply Mac locations offer high-margin Apple-certified services that we offer for all Apple products regardless of where they were purchased.  We are on track to open between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores later this year and grow our annual profits in this segment between 30% and 40%. 
And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Mauler to discuss another new growth opportunity."

GameStop's international businesses had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 6.9% same-store sales increase, record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q1 2014. We h",521,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 6.9% same-store sales increase, record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q1 2014. We have now entered our third consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth.
Along with growth in the pre-owned and digital categories, one significant global driver of GameStop same-store sales and profitability increase during the quarter was the expansion of our licensed merchandise and collectibles category, or what our customers like to call loot. Driven by exciting new products like Game of Thrones and Minecraft LEGO, this is our fastest-growing global category during the quarter and was accretive to our overall margin rate. 
As we have mentioned on previous calls, over the last several years, GameStop has focused on expanding its franchise marketing efforts, especially around the launch of major new releases. The global focus on selling related products that tie of software IP, such as Call of Duty, Batman or Pokémon, has helped increase the sales and gross margin per customer transaction and has also been met with enthusiastic demand from our customers, extending the consumer's experience with the brands they love.
Driven by the high demand for these types of products and feedback from our customers through PowerUp Rewards, our team in Australia piloted expanding the range of loot in all locations to include other gaming and pop-culture related products such as cards, boardgames, T-shirts and exclusive collectibles related to popular games, movies and TV shows.  With dedicated in-store sections and an expanded assortment, our sales and margin have increased rapidly. 
Finally, due to the success of our in-store loot expansion in Australia, we have also been testing over the past 5 months a stand-alone retail concept called sync pop-culture, which is devoted to this category. The initial pilots have been successful, and we ended the quarter with 6 stores.  Based on this success and key learning from our merchant teams worldwide coordinated their efforts for the initial launch of this product category in all 6,100 stores in the U.S. and Europe during this first quarter.  
As sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. This second wave of expansion will be completed by the end of the second quarter.  The expansion of this category have been met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers. And we expect continued strong sales growth in 2015 driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as recent release of the Avengers Age of Ultron, , Hunger Games and the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens, which is experiencing very strong pre-orders.
In North America, the entertainment collectible and licensed merchandise and category that we are competing in is approximately $11 billion annually and is very fragmented. We are excited about the opportunity to drive continued same-store sales growth and increasing relevance with our customers. And we expect this category to grow to a $500 million business globally for us over the next 3 years. Now I'll turn it over to Paul."

So I think what you're hearing on the 15% to 20%, as I've been listening, is that typically responds to a game for a specific time frame generally around the launch period."

The remainder obviously will be physical, and that industry has reached an equilibrium in terms of digital versus physical. Movies, I think, are around 42% based on some data that was put together for us by Tony . And then, the music industry is in the mid-40s in terms of a physical and digital split. And so the way that we approach of this is in thinking about our business, we have the most expensive form of media. We have the most established secondhand market. There's a little bit of one for book, there really isn't for music and movies anymore. Customers know that their games are worth $20 to $25. And our form of media is also the most difficult to download. So as you think about where the consumer might go, it just doesn't seem logical to us that they would extend digital adoption past the master point of any of those forms of media."

We always start our call the same way, but let me just thank every single associate in our organization for extraordinary service and execution this quarter. This was a great",1023,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the GameStop earnings call. We always start our call the same way, but let me just thank every single associate in our organization for extraordinary service and execution this quarter. This was a great quarter, and GameStop once again demonstrated that we will protect our family of associates, customers and investors going forward.
I want to welcome our cast of characters here today: Tony Bartel, our Chief Operating Officer; Rob Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Mauler, our President of International; Mike Hogan, our Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development; Mike Buskey, our President of U.S. Stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor and Public Relations.
Let me say it again. What a quarter, comps of 8.6%, new software growth of 9.6% and earnings per share growth of 15%.
Starting with core. I couldn't be prouder of our associates in stores and SSCs around the world as GameStop grew market share to record levels. The base model of reserving games, providing unique content and trade currency and delivering midnight launches continues to differentiate us in the market. Digital growth was also tremendous at 17.2%, led by DLC, mobile and Steam cards. The big idea of offering every customer add-on digital content for their physical games continues to play well with publishers and gamers around the world. We are also seeing great growth at our Kongregate unit on mobile games and are targeting 12 games for publishing this year.
Pre-owned business had flattish growth with very high margins. As you know, new software took a little longer to grow last year as we overlapped the decline of old gen. A similar phenomenon is happening in our pre-owned business with next-gen pre-owned showing great growth as old gen declines. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the year excluding currency. And Tony Bartel will share details with you on our core business.
The Technology Brands business continues to make great strides. Jason Ellis and his team are up to 549 stores, and all 3 divisions continue to receive accolades from AT&T and Apple. We are very important to both AT&T and Apple as an extension of their brands and provider of new services and products.
As you know, we are heavily involved in the review of RadioShack real estate, and we are very active in the M&A markets with dealers across the country. One of the most gratifying pieces of our success in Tech Brands is that we have accomplished a lot of growth while maintaining a very high rate of quality and a low churn rate. 
Going back to our earliest conversations with AT&T and Apple. We made a commitment to grow the business but only while we maintain a very high quality level of service and in-store experience, and we are accomplishing that. Tony will also share with you some color on Tech Brands.
Another piece of the business that is officially launching this year is our collectibles and licensed merchandise category, which gamers refer to as Loot. We have learned a great deal about this fast-growing popular consumer segment from our Australian colleagues, who have been piloting the business model for 2 years. You may have noted that we have rolled collectibles sections in all our stores, with some receiving broader exposures than others. I have to salute our global merchandising team of Shane Stockwell and Egan Steel [ph] in Austria, Michael van den Berg in Europe and Bob Puzon in the United States for coming together to make this effort happen so quickly. You will see that we can effectively merchandise video game and popular culture merchandise in our stores, along with game or show launches. Mike Mauler will give you color on collectibles and licensed merchandise. But we expect that business to grow to $500 million within 3 years, and it is off to a great start.
Our capital allocation strategy remains disciplined. We bought back over $46 million of stock this quarter at about $39 per share and expect to repurchase at least $200 million over the course of fiscal 2015. We will also pay a dividend of $1.44 this year, a healthy 3.6% yield before the call started, one of the highest in consumer retail. As you know, we sought some debt last fall to fund our Tech Brands acquisition efforts, and our capital formula will remain disciplined and consistent.
Guidance for the second quarter is for flat to mid-teens growth, and we increased our annual guidance by the share count reduction achieved through the shares we purchased during the first quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so. Rob Lloyd will give you more color on our results and expectations.
It is interesting, when we first started talking about driving a high rate of internal change here at GameStop a few years ago, we had no idea how rapidly our external space would change. The good news is that we have persevered and today find ourselves with an abundance of good business opportunities as we build a portfolio of specialty retail brands to make your affordable technologies affordable and simple.
Here are a few key strategy points to remember about GameStop. We will continue to innovate and expand share in our growing video game business, and publishers of all kinds are participating in that process. We created a digital process for selling DLC, Steam cards, full game downloads, Kongregate mobile publishing and many others. We will continue to create and innovate in the digital category to serve our customers.
PowerUp Rewards is a foundational backbone to the business at 40 million members. Technology Brands is a strong partnership with AT&T and Apple, and we can continue to be successful only to the extent that we serve their needs. New categories like collectibles and others upcoming will continue. We are very active in the M&A space as we continue to diversify the company, and our capital allocation will continue to be disciplined.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rob."
1342560,297541748,823073,"GameStop Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 28, 2015",2015-05-28,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter.

I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter. Here are the highlights.
Overall results exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 3.2% in the quarter, driven by next-gen software growth. Comparable store sales increased 8.6%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 300 basis points. Gross margins declined 40 basis points on the strength of 10% new software growth and the resulting shift in sales mix. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, down from 24.1% in the prior year quarter due to leveraging the sales growth. Operating earnings increased 17% for the quarter on the strength of our sales results. Interest expense increased $4.8 million due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Net income increased 8.5%, and EPS increased 15.3%. Foreign currency moves cost nearly $100 million in sales but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales increased 400 basis points in the quarter but increased 5.1% excluding FX because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and handheld units. Software sales grew 9.6%, or 15.8% excluding FX, driven by our market-leading position on strong new titles such as Mortal Kombat X, Battlefield Hardline and Dying Light. 
Preowned revenue was down 3.4% but actually increased 0.8% excluding FX. A 49.1% pre-owned margin rate for the quarter were 140 basis points higher than Q4 and comparable to the prior year quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 17.2%, or 23.3% excluding FX, to over 220 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Evolve and Mortal Kombat. GAAP digital revenues declined 18% year-over-year due to FX impact and because we now account for Kongregate on a commission basis compared to a gross receipt basis in Q1 of last year.
Mobile revenues increased 33.9%, which was attributed to the 70% growth in our Technology Brands revenues. Mobile margins for the quarter increased due to margins -- margin improvement in Technology Brands from 36.2% in Q1 last year to 39.8%.
Tech Brands revenues totaled $102.2 million, up 70% from the first quarter of last year, and we ended the quarter with 549 Spring Mobile and Simply Mac stores. Tech Brands operating income was $3.1 million, which was down from $6 million a year ago due to added infrastructure costs of approximately $4 million to prepare for opening roughly 200 new stores over this coming summer. The number of store openings in the next 3 months is 4x the highest number of stores we had opened in any previous quarter, and we needed to hire and train store personnel and field management in order to ensure successful openings. These added infrastructure costs will also impact the second quarter.
Some other data points are as follows. We closed a net of 40 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened a net of 65 Technology Brand stores.
In the quarter, we repurchased $46.4 million in stock or 1.19 million shares at an average price of $39.03. And we paid the first quarter dividend at $0.36 per share.
Now I'd like to discuss second quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to be flat to positive 3% and revenues to range from a decline of 3% to flat year-over-year. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the second quarter of last year.
We expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically during the second quarter. The industry and GameStop will be comping Mario Kart 8 and Watch Dogs in May. On the other hand, Batman: Arkham Knight in June does not have a significant comparison from last year. There are no major titles expected in July to compare to the Last of Us for next gen from last July. Due to our over-indexing in market share on new titles, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the second quarter as the 2 biggest titles, The Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight, are not expected to sell through as many units as the 2 biggest titles of Q2 2014, Watch Dogs and Mario Kart. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Watch Dogs and Mario Kart were sold in the second quarter of last year. Our share of that helped drive a 16% increase in new software and 22% comps for us in the second quarter of 2014.
Despite this decline, we still expect higher operating earnings compared to the prior year quarter due to the strength in other areas of our business. We are guiding EPS for our second quarter to range from $0.21 to $0.25 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the second quarter of last year. And we will have approximately $0.03 per share in interest expense.
You should model 108 million shares outstanding for the second quarter and 108.2 million shares outstanding for the full year based on buyback through the end of the second quarter. After considering buybacks we've completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share to a higher range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

As Rob and Paul have already shared, Q1 was a strong quarter for GameStop and showed the power of our diversification efforts. We achieved record Q1 market share, gained share in digital, met our pre-owned expectations and grew Technology Brands, all while maintaining high customer satisfaction levels.
We remain focused on being the premier video game destination. And we drove 360 basis points of total video game market share growth during the quarter. We increased our Xbox One and PS4 software share by 420 basis points to 54% and our new gen hardware share by 260 basis points to 38.5%. On a combined basis, GameStop sold 46% of all Xbox One and PS4 hardware and software combined during the quarter, up 610 basis points from last year.
We continue to gain share in a new cycle that is significantly outpacing previous launches. The month of April was even more impressive than the quarter as we captured 47.6 of all software sold. We sold 57% of all Xbox One and PS4 software during the month and nearly half of all the new gen hardware and software combined.
A promotion that we recently ran showed the power of our unique value proposition. During the month of April, we partnered with Microsoft to run a promotion where customers could buy a new Xbox One console for $275 with a trade-in of either a PS3 or an Xbox 360 console. We nearly doubled our Xbox One market share during the month, but more importantly, GameStop drove 2/3 of the 63% industry growth that Xbox One experienced during the month. We are providing unprecedented value that is fueling this cycle's growth.
We also gained share in digital receipts as we grew 17.2% after the impact of FX to outpace aggregate growth of our top 4 publishing partners. In the U.S., we grew 22.7% and we grew international 24.9% excluding FX. GameStop's full game AAA downloads more than tripled, and our downloadable content increased by 83% during the quarter. Based on information from DFC Intelligence, full game AAA digital downloads represented 3% of the total software market in the first quarter, and that specific segment was 40% smaller than the downloadable content category. Indie games and catalog games are bigger than both of these categories combined, and we are developing plans that we will share on future calls to increase our share in this important category.
As we noted in our fourth quarter release, we are seeing far fewer digital tokens packed in the hardware, and we do not expect significant digital pack-ins for the balance of the year.
Kongregate continued to expand its mobile publishing efforts, increasing mobile revenue by 37% during the quarter and exceeding 40 million mobile game installs live to date. We are on track to launch 12 games this year.
Turning to pre-owned sales. Our growth of 0.8% excluding FX met our expectations as our pre-owned sales have a higher mix of declining prior gen software than our new business has. As you can see on Slide 7 in supplemental data provided on our website, our pre-owned business is outpacing our new business in both software categories, new gen and prior gen, besting new gen growth by 31 points and prior gen decline by 38 points. However, because we still have a higher mix of prior gen, our overall pre-owned growth is 13 points behind our new software growth. As our new gen pre-owned inventory continues to build, we expect our full year pre-owned growth rate to be mid-single digits.
Finally, our Technology Brand division continues to expand. Our end-of-quarter store count of 549 stores is more than double our count at the end of Q1 2014. As Rob indicated, we are investing for significant growth over the summer when we plan to open approximately 200 stores. These stores are a combination of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and white space stores. In addition, we continue to be active in the acquisition market. Technology Brands stores that have been open more than a year are growing earnings at a strong double-digit pace, and this gives us confidence to continue to invest in this fast growth concept.
We are currently the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller, the second-largest and fastest-growing AT&T authorized dealer and a top 5 Cricket dealer. As impressive as that growth is, what is even more impressive is our ability to quickly ramp these businesses while still maintaining a high level of customer service. We are the most productive dealer in the AT&T network and remain in the top tier of all Apple authorized resellers. Our churn is down and the Next program is driving traffic growth. The strength of our relationship with AT&T and Apple has allowed us to quickly become large national dealers in their respective networks as we continue to expand our retail footprint in a high service manner.
These relationships also provide us with new opportunities to drive even greater growth. Our AT&T stores are ready to sell future AT&T products and services, and we are also assessing our GameStop stores for these services as well. And over 50% of the traffic that we receive at our Simply Mac locations offer high-margin Apple-certified services that we offer for all Apple products regardless of where they were purchased. We are on track to open between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores later this year and grow our annual profits in this segment between 30% and 40%.
And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Mauler to discuss another exciting new growth opportunity."

We h",527,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 6.9% same-store sales increase, record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q1 2014. We have now entered our third consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth.
Along with growth in the pre-owned and digital categories, one significant global driver of GameStop same-store sales and profitability increase during the quarter was the expansion of our licensed merchandise and collectibles category, or what our customers like to call Loot. Driven by exciting new products such as Zelda Monopoly, Game of Thrones: POP! Vinyl and Minecraft LEGO, this is our fastest-growing global category during the quarter and was accretive to our overall margin rate.
As we have mentioned on previous calls, over the last several years, GameStop has focused on expanding its franchise marketing efforts, especially around the launch of major new releases. The global focus on selling related products that tie to software IP, such as Call of Duty, Batman or Pokémon, has helped increase the sales and gross margin per customer transaction and has also been met with enthusiastic demand from our customers, extending the consumers' experience with the brands they love.
Driven by the high demand for these types of products and feedback from our customers through PowerUp Rewards, our team in Australia piloted expanding the range of Loot in all locations to include other gaming and pop culture related products such as cards, boardgames, T-shirts and exclusive collectibles related to popular games, movies and TV shows. With dedicated in-store sections and an expanded assortment, sales and margin have increased rapidly.
Finally, due to the success of our in-store Loot expansion in Australia, we have also been testing over the past 5 months a stand-alone retail concept called ZiNG Pop Culture, which is devoted to this category. The initial pilots have been successful, and we ended the quarter with 6 stores. Based on this success and key learnings, our merchant teams worldwide coordinated their efforts for the initial launch of this product category in all 6,100 stores in the U.S. and Europe during this first quarter.
As sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. This second wave of expansion will be completed by the end of the second quarter. The expansion of this category have been met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers. And we expect continued strong sales growth in 2015 driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as the recent release of the Avengers: Age of Ultron, Pixels, Hunger Games and the upcoming Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, which is experiencing very strong pre-orders.
In North America, the entertainment collectible and licensed merchandising category that we are competing in is approximately $11 billion annually and is very fragmented. We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales growth and increasing relevance with our customers. And we expect this category to grow to a $500 million business globally for us over the next 3 years.
Now I will turn it over to Paul."

And obviously, what we do there, we do a great job of helping people discover that content because it's great content but not a lot of people know about it. And then as we've talked about before, a lot of that content is actually purchased with trade credits at our stores. So we make it affordable. I think the same model applies to digital full game download as well. And so we'll continue to help people discover the full game download, and we're really -- we really are very customer-centric on this. But if they want to buy digital, we sell them digital. If they want to buy physical and get the residual benefit of being able to use -- for trade credit, we're going to sell them physical. Like I shared though, we have some exciting things planned that we will share in the future about what is a bigger category, which is indie and catalog games. And that's a much bigger category than both DLC and full game AAA downloads combined. So..."

Tony mentioned that we're -- what we're trying to do is give the customer what they want, whether that's digital or physical. And so we spent some time in the past few months, and we've talked to many of you about this, studying other forms of media and what the customer adoption has been in terms of digital versus physical. On the book side of the business, somewhere between 25%, 27% of the book business is now digital. The remainder, obviously, will be physical, and that industry has reached an equilibrium in terms of digital versus physical. Movies, I think, are around 42% based upon some data that was put together for us by Tony Wible. And then the music industry is in the mid-40s in terms of a physical and digital split. And so the way that we approach this is in thinking about our business, we have the most expensive form of media. We have the most established secondhand market. There's a little bit of one for books. There really isn't for music or movies anymore. Customers know that their games are worth $20 to $25. And our form of media is also the most difficult to download. So as you think about where the consumer might go, it just doesn't seem logical to us that they would extend digital adoption past the point of any of those other forms of media."

So we do believe that is sustainable. And then I think what you're seeing -- what you see in the digital category is in an increase of margin rate from the mid-60s to the high 70s is a function of how we have accounted for Kongregate differently this year. And I would say that, that business looks sustainable as well. The bulk of our revenues on the digital side of our business are now recorded on that commission basis, and so that -- we think that is the pattern. And then the category -- the other category is impacted by what Mike Mauler described with his commentary around the collectibles and the Loot merchandise. And as we continue to grow that business, we think that it's going to be beneficial for that category and for the business overall.

We always start our calls the same way, but let me just thank every single associate in our organization for extraordinary service and execution this quarter. This was a great quarter, and GameStop once again demonstrated that we will protect our family of associates, customers and investors going forward.
I want to welcome our cast of characters here today: Tony Bartel, our Chief Operating Officer; Rob Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Mauler, our President of International; Mike Hogan, our Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development; Mike Buskey, our President of U.S. Stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor and Public Relations.
Let me say it again. What a quarter, comps of 8.6%, new software growth of 9.6% and earnings per share growth of 15%.
Starting with the core. We couldn't be prouder of our associates in stores and SSCs around the world as GameStop grew market share to record levels. The base model of reserving games, providing unique content and trade currency and delivering midnight launches continues to differentiate us in the market. Digital growth was also tremendous at 17.2%, led by DLC, mobile and Steam cards. The big idea of offering every customer add-on digital content for their physical games continues to play well with publishers and gamers around the world. We are also seeing great growth at our Kongregate unit on mobile games and are targeting 12 games for publishing this year.
Pre-owned business had flattish growth with very high margins. As you know, new software took a little longer to grow last year as we overlapped the decline of old gen. A similar phenomenon is happening in our pre-owned business with next-gen pre-owned showing great growth as old gen declines. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the year excluding currency. And Tony Bartel will share details with you on our core business.
The Technology Brands business continues to make great strides. Jason Ellis and his team are up to 549 stores, and all 3 divisions continue to receive accolades from AT&T and Apple. We are very important to both AT&T and Apple as an extension of their brands and provider of new services and products.
As you know, we are heavily involved in the review of RadioShack real estate, and we are very active in the M&A markets with dealers across the country. One of the most gratifying pieces of our success in Tech Brands is that we have accomplished a lot of growth while maintaining a very high rate of quality and a low churn rate. 
Going back to our earliest conversations with AT&T and Apple. We made a commitment to grow the business but only while we maintained a very high quality level of service and in-store experience, and we are accomplishing that. Tony will also share with you some color on Tech Brands.
Another piece of the business that is officially launching this year is our collectibles and licensed merchandise category, which gamers refer to as Loot. We have learned a great deal about this fast-growing popular consumer segment from our Australian colleagues, who have been piloting the business model for 2 years. You may have noted that we have rolled collectibles sections in all our stores, with some receiving broader exposures than others. I have to salute our global merchandising team of Shane Stockwell and Egan Still [ph] in Austria, Michael van den Berg in Europe and Bob Puzon in the United States for coming together to make this effort happen so quickly. You will see that we can effectively merchandise video game and popular culture merchandise in our stores, along with game or show launches. Mike Mauler will give you color on collectibles and licensed merchandise. But we expect that business to grow to $500 million within 3 years, and it is off to a great start.
Our capital allocation strategy remains disciplined. We bought back over $46 million of stock this quarter at about $39 per share and expect to repurchase at least $200 million over the course of fiscal 2015. We will also pay a dividend of $1.44 this year, a healthy 3.6% yield before the call started, one of the highest in consumer retail. As you know, we sought some debt last fall to fund our Tech Brands acquisition efforts, and our capital formula will remain disciplined and consistent.
Guidance for the second quarter is for flat to mid-teens growth, and we increased our annual guidance by the share count reduction achieved through the shares repurchased during the first quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so. Rob Lloyd will give you more color on our results and expectations.
It is interesting, when we first started talking about driving a high rate of internal change here at GameStop a few years ago, we had no idea how rapidly our external space would change. The good news is that we have persevered and today find ourselves with an abundance of good business opportunities as we build a portfolio of specialty retail brands to make your affordable technologies affordable and simple.
Here are a few key strategy points to remember about GameStop. We will continue to innovate and expand share in our growing video game business, and publishers of all kinds are participating in that process. We created a digital process for selling DLC, Steam cards, full game downloads, Kongregate mobile publishing and many others. We will continue to create and innovate in the digital category to serve our customers.
PowerUp Rewards is a foundational backbone to the business at 40 million members. Technology Brands is a strong partnership with AT&T and Apple, and we can continue to be successful only to the extent that we serve their needs. New categories like collectibles and others upcoming will continue. We are very active in the M&A space as we continue to diversify the company, and our capital allocation will continue to be disciplined.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rob."
1342560,297541748,823104,"GameStop Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 28, 2015",2015-05-28,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter. Here are the highlights.Overall results exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operat",935,"Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter. Here are the highlights.
Overall results exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 3.2% in the quarter, driven by next-gen software growth. Comparable store sales increased 8.6%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 300 basis points. Gross margins declined 40 basis points on the strength of 10% new software growth and the resulting shift in sales mix. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, down from 24.1% in the prior year quarter due to leveraging the sales growth. Operating earnings increased 17% for the quarter on the strength of our sales results. Interest expense increased $4.8 million due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Net income increased 8.5%, and EPS increased 15.3%. Foreign currency moves cost nearly $100 million in sales but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter but increased 5.1% excluding FX because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and handheld units. Software sales grew 9.6%, or 15.8% excluding FX, driven by our market-leading position on strong new titles such as Mortal Kombat X, Battlefield Hardline and Dying Light. 
Preowned revenue was down 3.4% but actually increased 0.8% excluding FX. A 49.1% pre-owned margin rates for the quarter are 140 basis points higher than Q4 and comparable to the prior year quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 17.2%, or 23.3% excluding FX, to over $220 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Evolve and Mortal Kombat. GAAP digital revenues declined 18% year-over-year due to FX impact and because we now account for Kongregate on a commission basis compared to a gross receipt basis in Q1 of last year.
Mobile revenues increased 33.9%, which was attributed to the 70% growth in our Technology Brands revenues. Mobile margins for the quarter increased due to margins -- margin improvement in Technology Brands from 36.2% in Q1 last year to 39.8%.
Tech Brands revenues totaled $102.2 million, up 70% from the first quarter of last year, and we ended the quarter with 549 Spring Mobile and Simply Mac stores. Tech Brands operating income was $3.1 million, which was down from $6 million a year ago due to added infrastructure costs of approximately $4 million to prepare for opening roughly 200 new stores over this coming summer. The number of store openings in the next 3 months is 4x the highest number of stores we had opened in any previous quarter, and we needed to hire and train store personnel and field management in order to ensure successful openings. These added infrastructure costs will also impact the second quarter.
Some other data points are as follows. We closed a net of 40 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened a net of 65 Technology Brand stores.
In the quarter, we repurchased $46.4 million in stock or 1.19 million shares at an average price of $39.03. And we paid the first quarter dividend at $0.36 per share.
Now I'd like to discuss second quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to be flat to positive 3% and revenues to range from a decline of 3% to flat year-over-year. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the second quarter of last year.
We expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically during the second quarter. The industry and GameStop will be comping Mario Kart 8 and Watch Dogs in May. On the other hand, Batman: Arkham Knight in June does not have a significant comparison from last year. There are no major titles expected in July to compare to the Last of Us for next gen from last July. Due to our over-indexing in market share on new titles, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the second quarter as the 2 biggest titles, The Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight, are not expected to sell through as many units as the 2 biggest titles of Q2 2014, Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Watch Dogs and Mario Kart were sold in the second quarter of last year. Our share of that helped drive a 16% increase in new software and 22% comps for us in the second quarter of 2014.
Despite this decline, we still expect higher operating earnings compared to the prior year quarter due to the strength in other areas of our business. We are guiding EPS for our second quarter to range from $0.21 to $0.25 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the second quarter of last year. And we will have approximately $0.03 per share in interest expense.
You should model 108 million shares outstanding for the second quarter and 108.2 million shares outstanding for the full year based on buyback through the end of the first quarter. After considering buybacks we've completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share to a higher range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

As Rob and Paul have already shared, Q1 was a strong quarter for GameStop and showed the power of our diversification efforts. We achieved record Q1 market share, gained share in digital, met our pre-owned expectations and grew Technology Brands, all while maintaining high customer satisfaction levels.
We remain focused on being the premier video game destination. And we drove 360 basis points of total video game market share growth during the quarter. We increased our Xbox One and PS4 software share by 420 basis points to 54% and our new gen hardware share by 260 basis points to 38.5%. On a combined basis, GameStop sold 46% of all Xbox One and PS4 hardware and software combined during the quarter, up 610 basis points from last year.
We continue to gain share in a new cycle that is significantly outpacing previous launches. The month of April was even more impressive than the quarter as we captured 47.6 of all software sold. We sold 57% of all Xbox One and PS4 software during the month and nearly half of all the new gen hardware and software combined.
A promotion that we recently ran showed the power of our unique value proposition. During the month of April, we partnered with Microsoft to run a promotion where customers could buy a new Xbox One console for $275 with a trade-in of either a PS3 or an Xbox 360 console. We nearly doubled our Xbox One market share during the month, but more importantly, GameStop drove 2/3 of the 63% industry growth that Xbox One experienced during the month. We are providing unprecedented value that is fueling this cycle's growth.
We also gained share in digital receipts as we grew 17.2% after the impact of FX to outpace aggregate growth of our top 4 publishing partners. In the U.S., we grew 22.7% and we grew international 24.9% excluding FX. GameStop's full game AAA downloads more than tripled, and our downloadable content increased by 83% during the quarter. Based on information from DFC Intelligence, full game AAA digital downloads represented 3% of the total software market in the first quarter, and that specific segment was 40% smaller than the downloadable content category. Indie games and catalog games are bigger than both of these categories combined, and we are developing plans that we will share on future calls to increase our share in this important category.
As we noted in our fourth quarter release, we are seeing far fewer digital tokens packed into hardware, and we do not expect significant digital pack-ins for the balance of the year.
Kongregate continued to expand its mobile publishing efforts, increasing mobile revenue by 37% during the quarter and exceeding 40 million mobile game installs live to date. We are on track to launch 12 games this year.
Turning to pre-owned sales. Our growth of 0.8% excluding FX met our expectations as our pre-owned sales have a higher mix of declining prior gen software than our new business has. As you can see on Slide 7 in the supplemental data provided on our website, our pre-owned business is outpacing our new business in both software categories, new gen and prior gen, besting new gen growth by 31 points and prior gen decline by 38 points. However, because we still have a higher mix of prior gen, our overall pre-owned growth is 13 points behind our new software growth. As our new gen pre-owned inventory continues to build, we expect our full year pre-owned growth rate to be mid-single digits.
Finally, our Technology Brands division continues to expand. Our end-of-quarter store count of 549 stores is more than double our count at the end of Q1 2014. As Rob indicated, we are investing for significant growth over the summer when we plan to open approximately 200 stores. These stores are a combination of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and white space stores. In addition, we continue to be active in the acquisition market. Technology Brands stores that have been open more than a year are growing earnings at a strong double-digit pace, and this gives us confidence to continue to invest in this fast growth concept.
We are currently the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller, the second-largest and fastest-growing AT&T authorized dealer and a top 5 Cricket dealer. As impressive as that growth is, what is even more impressive is our ability to quickly ramp these businesses while still maintaining a high level of customer service. We are the most productive dealer in the AT&T network and remain in the top tier of all Apple authorized resellers. Our churn is down and the Next program is driving traffic growth. The strength of our relationship with AT&T and Apple has allowed us to quickly become large national dealers in their respective networks as we continue to expand our retail footprint in a high service manner.
These relationships also provide us with new opportunities to drive even greater growth. Our AT&T stores are ready to sell future AT&T products and services, and we are also assessing our GameStop stores for these services as well. And over 50% of the traffic that we receive at our Simply Mac locations offer high-margin Apple-certified services that we offer for all Apple products regardless of where they were purchased. We are on track to open between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores this year and grow our annual profits in this segment between 30% and 40%.
And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Mauler to discuss another exciting new growth opportunity."

We h",529,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 6.9% same-store sales increase, record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q1 2014. We have now entered our third consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth.
Along with growth in the pre-owned and digital categories, one significant global driver of GameStop same-store sales and profitability increase during the quarter was the expansion of our licensed merchandise and collectibles category, or what our customers like to call Loot. Driven by exciting new products such as Zelda Monopoly, Game of Thrones: POP! Vinyl and Minecraft LEGO, this is our fastest-growing global category during the quarter and was accretive to our overall margin rate.
As we have mentioned on previous calls, over the last several years, GameStop has focused on expanding its franchise marketing efforts, especially around the launch of major new releases. The global focus on selling related products that tie to software IP, such as Call of Duty, Batman or Pokémon, has helped increase the sales and gross margin per customer transaction and has also been met with enthusiastic demand from our customers, extending the consumers' experience with the brands they love.
Driven by the high demand for these types of products and feedback from our customers through PowerUp Rewards, our team in Australia piloted expanding the range of Loot in all locations to include other gaming and pop culture related products such as cards, board games, T-shirts and exclusive collectibles related to popular games, movies and TV shows. With dedicated in-store sections and an expanded assortment, sales and margin have increased rapidly.
Finally, due to the success of our in-store Loot expansion in Australia, we have also been testing over the past 5 months a stand-alone retail concept called ZiNG Pop Culture, which is devoted to this category. The initial pilots have been successful, and we have ended the quarter with 6 stores. Based on this success and key learnings, our merchant teams worldwide coordinated their efforts for the initial launch of this product category in all 6,100 stores in the U.S. and Europe during this first quarter.
As sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. This second wave of expansion will be completed by the end of the second quarter. The expansion of this category has been met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers. And we expect continued strong sales growth in 2015 driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as the recent release of the Avengers: Age of Ultron, Pixels, Hunger Games and the upcoming Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, which is experiencing very strong pre-orders.
In North America, the entertainment collectible and licensed merchandising category that we are competing in is approximately $11 billion annually and is very fragmented. We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales growth and increasing relevance with our customers. And we expect this category to grow to a $500 million business globally for us over the next 3 years.
Now I will turn it over to Paul."

If they want to buy physical and get the residual benefits of being able to use it for a trade credit, we're going to sell them physical.

And so we spent some time in the past few months, and we've talked to many of you about this, studying other forms of media and what the customer adoption has been in terms of digital versus physical. On the book side of the business, somewhere between 25%, 27% of the book business is now digital. The remainder, obviously, would be physical, and that industry has reached an equilibrium in terms of digital versus physical. Movies, I think, are around 42% based upon some data that was put together for us by Tony Wible. And then the music industry is in the mid-40s in terms of a physical and digital split. And so the way that we approach this is in thinking about our business, we have the most expensive form of media. We have the most established secondhand market. There's a little bit of one for books. There really isn't for music or movies anymore. Customers know that their games are worth $20 to $25. And our form of media is also the most difficult to download. So as you think about where the consumer might go, it just doesn't seem logical to us that they would extend digital adoption past the point of any of those other forms of media."

For example, we've talked about how [ph] the next program had a dramatic impact on sales dollars, but not necessarily gross profit dollars. So our guys who've been running the business, Jason Ellis, who Paul has mentioned, has been doing this for about 14, 15 years. And the focus that they put on each store is what the gross profit per opportunity or customer that you sign up is as well as what the gross profit volume is for the store on a month-over-month and year-over-year kind of a basis. And so we've been very pleased with the profitability that -- and productivity that Jason and his team have been able to drive in our stores in terms of that gross profit per door is what they call it."

And then I think what you're seeing -- what you see in the digital category is in an increase of margin rate from the mid-60s to the high 70s is a function of how we have accounted for Kongregate differently this year. And I would say that, that business looks sustainable as well. The bulk of our revenues on the digital side of our business are now recorded on that commission basis, and so that -- we think that is the pattern.

This was a great",1022,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the GameStop earnings call. We always start our calls the same way, but let me just thank every single associate in our organization for extraordinary service and execution this quarter. This was a great quarter, and GameStop once again demonstrated that we will protect our family of associates, customers and investors going forward.
I want to welcome our cast of characters here today: Tony Bartel, our Chief Operating Officer; Rob Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer; Mike Mauler, our President of International; Mike Hogan, our Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development; Mike Buskey, our President of U.S. Stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Investor and Public Relations.
Let me say it again. What a quarter, comps of 8.6%, new software growth of 9.6% and earnings per share growth of 15%.
Starting with the core. We couldn't be prouder of our associates in stores and SSCs around the world as GameStop grew market share to record levels. The base model of reserving games, providing unique content and trade currency and delivering midnight launches continues to differentiate us in the market. Digital growth was also tremendous at 17.2%, led by DLC, mobile and Steam cards. The big idea of offering every customer add-on digital content for their physical games continues to play well with publishers and gamers around the world. We are also seeing great growth at our Kongregate unit on mobile games and are targeting 12 games for publishing this year.
Pre-owned business had flattish growth with very high margins. As you know, new software took a little longer to grow last year as we overlapped the decline of old gen. A similar phenomenon is happening in our pre-owned business with next-gen pre-owned showing great growth as old gen declines. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the year excluding currency. And Tony Bartel will share details with you on our core business.
The Technology Brands business continues to make great strides. Jason Ellis and his team are up to 549 stores, and all 3 divisions continue to receive accolades from AT&T and Apple. We are very important to both AT&T and Apple as an extension of their brands and provider of new services and products.
As you know, we are heavily involved in the review of RadioShack real estate, and we are very active in the M&A markets with dealers across the country. One of the most gratifying pieces of our success in Tech Brands is that we have accomplished a lot of growth while maintaining a very high rate of quality and a low churn rate. 
Going back to our earliest conversations with AT&T and Apple. We made a commitment to grow the business but only while we maintained a very high quality level of service and in-store experience, and we are accomplishing that. Tony will also share with you some color on Tech Brands.
Another piece of the business that is officially launching this year is our collectibles and licensed merchandise category, which gamers refer to as Loot. We have learned a great deal about this fast-growing popular consumer segment from our Australian colleagues, who have been piloting the business model for 2 years. You may have noted that we have rolled collectibles sections in all our stores, with some receiving broader exposures than others. I have to salute our global merchandising team of Shane Stockwell and Egan Still in Australia, Michael van den Berg in Europe and Bob Puzon in the United States for coming together to make this effort happen so quickly. You will see that we can effectively merchandise video game and popular culture merchandise in our stores, along with game or show launches. Mike Mauler will give you color on collectibles and licensed merchandise. But we expect that business to grow to $500 million within 3 years, and it is off to a great start.
Our capital allocation strategy remains disciplined. We bought back over $46 million of stock this quarter at about $39 per share and expect to repurchase at least $200 million over the course of fiscal 2015. We will also pay a dividend of $1.44 this year, a healthy 3.6% yield before the call started, one of the highest in consumer retail. As you know, we sought some debt last fall to fund our Tech Brands acquisition efforts, and our capital formula will remain disciplined and consistent.
Guidance for the second quarter is for flat to mid-teens growth, and we increased our annual guidance by the share count reduction achieved through the shares repurchased during the first quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so. Rob Lloyd will give you more color on our results and expectations.
It is interesting, when we first started talking about driving a high rate of internal change here at GameStop a few years ago, we had no idea how rapidly our external space would change. The good news is that we have persevered and today find ourselves with an abundance of good business opportunities as we build a portfolio of specialty retail brands to make your affordable technologies affordable and simple.
Here are a few key strategy points to remember about GameStop. We will continue to innovate and expand share in our growing video game business, and publishers of all kinds are participating in that process. We created a digital process for selling DLC, Steam cards, full game downloads, Kongregate mobile publishing and many others. We will continue to create and innovate in the digital category to serve our customers.
PowerUp Rewards is a foundational backbone to the business at 40 million members. Technology Brands is a strong partnership with AT&T and Apple, and we can continue to be successful only to the extent that we serve their needs. New categories like collectibles and others upcoming will continue. We are very active in the M&A space as we continue to diversify the company, and our capital allocation will continue to be disciplined.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rob."
1342560,297541748,823377,"GameStop Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 28, 2015",2015-05-28,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter. Here are the highlights.Overall results exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operat",935,"Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by covering the results of the quarter. We had a fantastic quarter. Here are the highlights.
Overall results exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 3.2% in the quarter, driven by next-gen software growth. Comparable store sales increased 8.6%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 300 basis points. Gross margins declined 40 basis points on the strength of 10% new software growth and the resulting shift in sales mix. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, down from 24.1% in the prior year quarter due to leveraging the sales growth. Operating earnings increased 17% for the quarter on the strength of our sales results. Interest expense increased $4.8 million due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Net income increased 8.5%, and EPS increased 15.3%. Foreign currency moves cost nearly $100 million in sales but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales increased 40 basis points in the quarter but increased 5.1% excluding FX because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and handheld units. Software sales grew 9.6%, or 15.8% excluding FX, driven by our market-leading position on strong new titles such as Mortal Kombat X, Battlefield Hardline and Dying Light. 
Pre-owned revenue was down 3.4% but actually increased 0.8% excluding FX. A 49.1% pre-owned margin rates for the quarter are 140 basis points higher than Q4 and comparable to the prior year quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 17.2%, or 23.3% excluding FX, to over $220 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Evolve and Mortal Kombat. GAAP digital revenues declined 18% year-over-year due to FX impact and because we now account for Kongregate on a commission basis compared to a gross receipt basis in Q1 of last year.
Mobile revenues increased 33.9%, which was attributed to the 70% growth in our Technology Brands revenues. Mobile margins for the quarter increased due to margins -- margin improvement in Technology Brands from 36.2% in Q1 last year to 39.8%.
Tech Brands revenues totaled $102.2 million, up 70% from the first quarter of last year, and we ended the quarter with 549 Spring Mobile and Simply Mac stores. Tech Brands operating income was $3.1 million, which was down from $6 million a year ago due to added infrastructure costs of approximately $4 million to prepare for opening roughly 200 new stores over this coming summer. The number of store openings in the next 3 months is 4x the highest number of stores we had opened in any previous quarter, and we needed to hire and train store personnel and field management in order to ensure successful openings. These added infrastructure costs will also impact the second quarter.
Some other data points are as follows. We closed a net of 40 video game stores around the world. We acquired or opened a net of 65 Technology Brand stores.
In the quarter, we repurchased $46.4 million in stock or 1.19 million shares at an average price of $39.03. And we paid the first quarter dividend at $0.36 per share.
Now I'd like to discuss second quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to be flat to positive 3% and revenues to range from a decline of 3% to flat year-over-year. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the second quarter of last year.
We expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically during the second quarter. The industry and GameStop will be comping Mario Kart 8 and Watch Dogs in May. On the other hand, Batman: Arkham Knight in June does not have a significant comparison from last year. There are no major titles expected in July to compare to the Last of Us for next gen from last July. Due to our over-indexing in market share on new titles, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the second quarter as the 2 biggest titles, The Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight, are not expected to sell through as many units as the 2 biggest titles of Q2 2014, Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Watch Dogs and Mario Kart were sold in the second quarter of last year. Our share of that helped drive a 16% increase in new software and 22% comps for us in the second quarter of 2014.
Despite this decline, we still expect higher operating earnings compared to the prior year quarter due to the strength in other areas of our business. We are guiding EPS for our second quarter to range from $0.21 to $0.25 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the second quarter of last year. And we will have approximately $0.03 per share in interest expense.
You should model 108 million shares outstanding for the second quarter and 108.2 million shares outstanding for the full year based on buyback through the end of the first quarter. After considering buybacks we've completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share to a higher range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

As Rob and Paul have already shared, Q1 was a strong quarter for GameStop and showed the power of our diversification efforts. We achieved record Q1 market share, gained share in digital, met our pre-owned expectations and grew Technology Brands, all while maintaining high customer satisfaction levels.
We remain focused on being the premier video game destination. And we drove 360 basis points of total video game market share growth during the quarter. We increased our Xbox One and PS4 software share by 420 basis points to 54% and our new gen hardware share by 260 basis points to 38.5%. On a combined basis, GameStop sold 46% of all Xbox One and PS4 hardware and software combined during the quarter, up 610 basis points from last year.
We continue to gain share in a new cycle that is significantly outpacing previous launches. The month of April was even more impressive than the quarter as we captured 47.6 of all software sold. We sold 57% of all Xbox One and PS4 software during the month and nearly half of all the new gen hardware and software combined.
A promotion that we recently ran showed the power of our unique value proposition. During the month of April, we partnered with Microsoft to run a promotion where customers could buy a new Xbox One console for $275 with a trade-in of either a PS3 or an Xbox 360 console. We nearly doubled our Xbox One market share during the month, but more importantly, GameStop drove 2/3 of the 63% industry growth that Xbox One experienced during the month. We are providing unprecedented value that is fueling this cycle's growth.
We also gained share in digital receipts as we grew 17.2% after the impact of FX to outpace aggregate growth of our top 4 publishing partners. In the U.S., we grew 22.7% and we grew international 24.9% excluding FX. GameStop's full game AAA downloads more than tripled, and our downloadable content increased by 83% during the quarter. Based on information from DFC Intelligence, full game AAA digital downloads represented 3% of the total software market in the first quarter, and that specific segment was 40% smaller than the downloadable content category. Indie games and catalog games are bigger than both of these categories combined, and we are developing plans that we will share on future calls to increase our share in this important category.
As we noted in our fourth quarter release, we are seeing far fewer digital tokens packed into hardware, and we do not expect significant digital pack-ins for the balance of the year.
Kongregate continued to expand its mobile publishing efforts, increasing mobile revenue by 37% during the quarter and exceeding 40 million mobile game installs live to date. We are on track to launch 12 games this year.
Turning to pre-owned sales. Our growth of 0.8% excluding FX met our expectations as our pre-owned sales have a higher mix of declining prior gen software than our new business has. As you can see on Slide 7 in the supplemental data provided on our website, our pre-owned business is outpacing our new business in both software categories, new gen and prior gen, besting new gen growth by 31 points and prior gen decline by 38 points. However, because we still have a higher mix of prior gen, our overall pre-owned growth is 13 points behind our new software growth. As our new gen pre-owned inventory continues to build, we expect our full year pre-owned growth rate to be mid-single digits.
Finally, our Technology Brands division continues to expand. Our end-of-quarter store count of 549 stores is more than double our count at the end of Q1 2014. As Rob indicated, we are investing for significant growth over the summer when we plan to open approximately 200 stores. These stores are a combination of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and white space stores. In addition, we continue to be active in the acquisition market. Technology Brands stores that have been open more than a year are growing earnings at a strong double-digit pace, and this gives us confidence to continue to invest in this fast growth concept.
We are currently the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller, the second-largest and fastest-growing AT&T authorized dealer and a top 5 Cricket dealer. As impressive as that growth is, what is even more impressive is our ability to quickly ramp these businesses while still maintaining a high level of customer service. We are the most productive dealer in the AT&T network and remain in the top tier of all Apple authorized resellers. Our churn is down and the Next program is driving traffic growth. The strength of our relationship with AT&T and Apple has allowed us to quickly become large national dealers in their respective networks as we continue to expand our retail footprint in a high service manner.
These relationships also provide us with new opportunities to drive even greater growth. Our AT&T stores are ready to sell future AT&T products and services, and we are also assessing our GameStop stores for these services as well. And over 50% of the traffic that we receive at our Simply Mac locations offer high-margin Apple-certified services that we offer for all Apple products regardless of where they were purchased. We are on track to open between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores this year and grow our annual profits in this segment between 30% and 40%.
And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Mauler to discuss another exciting new growth opportunity."

GameStop's international businesses had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 6.9% same-store sales increase, record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q1 2014. We h",529,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a solid first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 6.9% same-store sales increase, record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q1 2014. We have now entered our third consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth.
Along with growth in the pre-owned and digital categories, one significant global driver of GameStop same-store sales and profitability increase during the quarter was the expansion of our licensed merchandise and collectibles category, or what our customers like to call Loot. Driven by exciting new products such as Zelda Monopoly, Game of Thrones: POP! Vinyl and Minecraft LEGO, this is our fastest-growing global category during the quarter and was accretive to our overall margin rate.
As we have mentioned on previous calls, over the last several years, GameStop has focused on expanding its franchise marketing efforts, especially around the launch of major new releases. The global focus on selling related products that tie to software IP, such as Call of Duty, Batman or Pokémon, has helped increase the sales and gross margin per customer transaction and has also been met with enthusiastic demand from our customers, extending the consumers' experience with the brands they love.
Driven by the high demand for these types of products and feedback from our customers through PowerUp Rewards, our team in Australia piloted expanding the range of Loot in all locations to include other gaming and pop culture related products such as cards, board games, T-shirts and exclusive collectibles related to popular games, movies and TV shows. With dedicated in-store sections and an expanded assortment, sales and margin have increased rapidly.
Finally, due to the success of our in-store Loot expansion in Australia, we have also been testing over the past 5 months a stand-alone retail concept called ZiNG Pop Culture, which is devoted to this category. The initial pilots have been successful, and we have ended the quarter with 6 stores. Based on this success and key learnings, our merchant teams worldwide coordinated their efforts for the initial launch of this product category in all 6,100 stores in the U.S. and Europe during this first quarter.
As sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. This second wave of expansion will be completed by the end of the second quarter. The expansion of this category has been met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers. And we expect continued strong sales growth in 2015 driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as the recent release of the Avengers: Age of Ultron, Pixels, Hunger Games and the upcoming Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, which is experiencing very strong pre-orders.
In North America, the entertainment collectible and licensed merchandising category that we are competing in is approximately $11 billion annually and is very fragmented. We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales growth and increasing relevance with our customers. And we expect this category to grow to a $500 million business globally for us over the next 3 years.
Now I will turn it over to Paul."

I think the same model applies to the digital full game download as well. And so we'll continue to help people discover the full game downloads, and we're really -- we really are very customer-centric on this. But if they want to buy digital, we sell them digital. If they want to buy physical and get the residual benefits of being able to use it for a trade credit, we're going to sell them physical.

And so we spent some time in the past few months, and we've talked to many of you about this, studying other forms of media and what the customer adoption has been in terms of digital versus physical. On the book side of the business, somewhere between 25%, 27% of the book business is now digital. The remainder, obviously, would be physical, and that industry has reached an equilibrium in terms of digital versus physical. Movies, I think, are around 42% based upon some data that was put together for us by Tony Wible. And then the music industry is in the mid-40s in terms of a physical and digital split. And so the way that we approach this is in thinking about our business, we have the most expensive form of media. We have the most established secondhand market. There's a little bit of one for books. There really isn't for music or movies anymore. Customers know that their games are worth $20 to $25. And our form of media is also the most difficult to download. So as you think about where the consumer might go, it just doesn't seem logical to us that they would extend digital adoption past the point of any of those other forms of media."

Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. store; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
We had a great quarter. Earnings per share growth was well ahead of consensus, growing 41% year-over-year. Our earnings per share grew 41% on top of 144% growth in the last year's second quarter. So comps are strong in the video game business, delivering 8.1% on top of last year's 22% comp. Digital growth without FX was 17.5% and preowned growth without FX was over 5%.
Technology Brands grew their store count by an impressive 182 stores, now standing at 731 stores. Spring Mobile is now AT&T's largest dealer and our acquisition pipeline is full. Rob and Tony will provide color on the video game business and the tech brand metrics.
During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Geeknet and the saintgeek.com brand. We are very excited about this opportunity and have spent significant time with the Geeknet team on the integration plan. Mike Hogan will share some early color on our progress.
Our collectibles or loot business had a very good quarter. What was once an experiment in Australia a little over 2 years ago has turned into a global businesses that is fueling rapid growth. As we see opportunities, we will continue to remodel GameStop [indiscernible] and less to video games, providing us a great competitive lever for the video game publishers. 
Integration with Saint Geek will only help this business. Mike Mauler will update you on our global progress.
Last quarter's capital allocation was again disciplined as we paid our dividend of $0.36 per share and bought back 60.7 million worth of our stock.
Taking a moment to step back and look at the business. You have to recognize that we have a knack for identifying and developing opportunities in transformational technology and business acquisitions that are paying off for shareholders.

For almost 23% of our gross profit, and we expect to see that grow. You should note that our 32.9% gross margin rate for the second quarter was among the highest in our history and gross profit dollars were a company record for the second quarter. Other categories like preowned may fluctuate depending on mix and promotions, but our ability to diversify into richer lines of business and products is allowing us to increase profitability.
We've provided guidance for Q3 that is slightly down to modestly up and increased our full year guidance by the share count bought back in the quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so.
We continue to spend a lot of time internally and with our Board in our strategic plan, assessing the size of markets and their adjacency to our core customer base. We seel more opportunities to leverage our core competencies of real estate, human talent, capital, buy-sell-trade and PowerUp Rewards into attractive new segments, The high rate of change will continue to define us and will protect our family.

I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color in the quarter. Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue growth, same-store",1270,"Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color in the quarter. Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margins, net income and EPS. Sales increased 1.8% in the quarter or 7.4% excluding FX. 
[Audio Gap] 
8.1%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by over 500 basis points. Gross margins expanded 110 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and growth in collectibles, leading to record second quarter gross profit of $580.5 [ph] million. Adjusted operating earnings increased over 65% for the quarter, driven by our sales growth in collectibles and margin expansion and mobile.
During the quarter, we incurred onetime charges of $9.1 million, primarily relating to the Geeknet acquisition and Tech Brand expansion, which included RadioShack store acquisition costs. SG&A adjusted sales was 27.3%, down slightly from 27.5% in the prior year quarter despite investments supporting Tech Brand expansion.
Interest expense increased $4.5 [ph] million due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Adjusted net income increased 34.6% and adjusted EPS increased over 40%, Along currency moves reduced sales nearly $100 million, but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 2.2%, but increased 3.7% excluding FX because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the U.S., we sold 42% more in next gen consoles than in the second quarter of 2014, leading to the outperformance in the comp results.
Software sales declined 6.0%, but increased 0.7% excluding FX as we overcame the comparison to Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8 from last year with strong performance on Witcher 3 and Batman Arkham Knight.
Preowned revenue grew 0.5% or plus [ph] 5.1% excluding FX as he saw continued growth in next gen preowned hardware and software. Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, down 100 basis points from the prior year due to higher refurbishment costs on an increased mix of hardware and accessories trades, which were driven by the successful trade up campaigns we ran during the quarter.
Digital receipt on a non-GAAP basis grew 11.1% or 17.5% excluding FX to $199 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Witcher 3 and Batman Arkham Knight. [indiscernible] digital revenues declined 20.5% year-over-year due to FX impact and because accounting for Kongregate on net commission basis as we discussed in the first quarter call. Mobile revenues increased 26.9%, driven by a 62.3% growth in our Technology Brands revenues and gross margins increased from 36.1% in Q2 last year to 45.4%.
As we stated on the last call, as we continue to rapidly expand our Tech Brand footprint due to the upfront investment costs in order to ensure a successful openings. This will impact short-term operating results, but will ultimately provide sustainable profits for the company. 
During the second quarter, we invested over $5 million for the 89 [ph] stores we opened and for the 90 to 100 stores to be opened during the third quarter. Q2's Tech Brands store growth also included the acquisition of 3 AT&T resellers totaling 93 stores, most of which were acquired at the end of July. 
Revenues from the other category increased 37.7% to $99.4 million or 48.5% growth excluding FX as we continue to expand our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We closed a net of 33 video game stores around the world. As Paul mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Geeknet, including the Think Geek brands and e-commerce site. The acquisition costs was $126 million net of cash acquired. Think Geek will be accretive in the second half of the year. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million in stock or 1.41 million shares at an average price of $43.04. We surpassed the $1.8 billion mark in cumulative buybacks with over 71 million shares acquired at an average price of $25.28. We remain committed to our buyback program and are on track to meet our 2015 objective of repurchasing at least $200 million of stock. We also paid the second quarter dividend at $0.36 per share. In the last 12 months, we've generated approximately $500 million in free cash flow and have returned $466 million in dividends and buybacks and have used an additional $247 million on acquisitions.
Now let's move on to third quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to remain from plus 1% to plus 4% and revenue growth to range from flat to positive 4%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to again negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the third quarter of last year.
Again, this quarter, we expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically. The August title line is lighter than last year, with Madden being the only comparison. In September, we will be comping [indiscernible] which is the very tough overlap us this year's version is only an expansion pack. Assassin's Creed and Halo should give us a favorable comp in October. 
Due to our over indexing in market share on Destiny from last year, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the third quarter. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Destiny were sold across 4 platforms in the third quarter of last year. This quarter's most anticipated title is expected to be Halo 5, which launches very late in the quarter and will only be available on 1 platform.
We also expect a slight decline on the preowned margin rate as the mixed shift to next gen from prior agenda and as we continue to invest in refurbishment of preowned consoles to support sales growth. Our peer costs remain comparable, but preowned hardware prices decline over time. Also, as a reminder, sales of next gen preowned units had a lower overall margin than prior gen units due to higher trade-in prices, which is typical on new console cycles. We are forecasting preowned margin to be between 44% and 46% for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect to expand gross margins compared to the prior year quarter as other areas of our business, such as mobile and collectibles positively contribute to our profits. Despite the upfront investment to support store openings, which I described earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands in the third quarter are forecasted to be comparable to the prior year quarter and are expected to grow more significantly in the fourth quarter. We are guiding earnings per share for our third quarter in the range from $0.53 to $0.60 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we have in the third quarter of last year, and we will have approximately $0.02 per share in additional interest expense. You should model 106.7 million shares outstanding for the third quarter and $107 million for the full year based on buybacks through the end of the second quarter. For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 5% and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 7%.
After concerning buybacks we have completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.63 [ph] to $3.83 per share to a higher range of $3.66 to $3.86 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

Our retail operations had another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on our unique specialty service model and grow our new preowned and digital video game business as well as our Technology Brands business. We believe that service matters, and our businesses are expanding because we meet the needs of our customers better than any of our competitors.
In new video games, we again increased share as our U.S. software grew 1.2% versus the decline in the overall market. Our software share increased by 1 point and we continue to sell over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software.
Our U.S. new hardware dollar sales grew 13.6% during the quarter versus a decline in the overall market, resulting in 4 points of hardware market share gain during the quarter. The comps remain strong in its 22nd month as we have tripled the number of PS4 units that were sold versus the PS3 launch and have nearly doubled the Xbox One units versus the 360 launch. Our preowned business outpaced the new business and grew during the quarter as we logged 0.5% growth after FX and 5% growth prior to the impact of FX. As is normal during this part of the launch cycle, our increasing mix of next gen sales is driving this growth. 
We are also in a good inventory position as our preowned inventory dollars are up 6% over the same period last year, driven entirely by next gen hardware and software growth, so we are well poised to achieve mid-single-digit global preowned growth for the full year.
Looking at digital, we again drove double-digit growth in non-GAAP digital receipts, which increased 17.5% for FX and 11.1% after FX. This growth was driven mainly by the increase in downloadable content that was sold with new game launches.
Kongregate will launch 7 new mobile games this quarter and is on track to grow mobile gaming revenues by approximately 50% for the full year. It is important to note that during the recent release of EA's Madden 16, we worked with our partners to operate 3 [ph] physical game with the purchase at either a PS4 for Xbox One and did not carry the Xbox One digital bundle. We expect that if the game is provided as a promotional item in a hardware bundle, GameStop will see more of these physical offers than digital pack-ins and upcoming third-party releases.
In our Tech Brand segment, we continue to extend our sales leadership as AT&T and Apple's brands in a high service manner, as our Technology Brands division is experiencing explosive growth. We continue to execute our strategy of growing up smaller dealers to improve productivity and leveraging our real estate expertise and adding new locations. Our Technology Brands position has had a very productive summer, opening or acquiring 182 stores since the end of Q1. Our store count as of the end of Q2 stand at 731 stores. This represents a 129% increase in store count versus the end of Q2 2014. While we still plan on adding between 450 to 550 Technology Brands store this year, the bulk of our investment spending is behind us and we anticipate seeing strong growth in the back half of the year, culminating in our Technology Brands' profits growing between 40% and 50% for the full year without infrastructure investment costs and 10% to 20% after such investment costs. This also sets us up for strong growth in 2016 and beyond.
Our Spring Mobile division is now not only the largest and fastest-growing AT&T dealer, but they continue to be the most productive dealer as well. Jason Ellis, our Senior Vice President of Technology Brands and his team, have done a great job of growing their business, while maintaining a high service standard. We are also the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller and the top 5 Cricket dealer. In early August, we also began selling DirecTV in all of our Spring Mobile stores, but we are now operating of fall lineup AT&T products and services in all of these stores. We are confident in our specialty retail expertise, across all of our brands and optimistic about continued growth in the back half of the year and in 2016.
Finally, we leave this weekend for our annual store managers confidence in Las Vegas, which will boast approximately 6,000 leaders from all of our companies and from around the world. We will have top leaders from all of our partners talking directly with our field leaders about their newest innovations and our plants for growth. The managers will also get hands-on experience on the latest innovations, most of which have never been used by the public. This investment ensures that we will have the most knowledgeable sales team in our industries and allows us to continue to provide better service than our competition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Moeller."

GameStop's International business had a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations with record market share and a significant improvement operating earnings over Q2 2014. Led by our Australian business with that 2-point -- 10.2% same-store sales increase.
Driving our increase in international earnings was digital receipt growth of 20% excluding FX, 30% e-commerce growth excluding FX, driven by expanding web and store sales, and the continued expansion of licensed merchandise and collectibles or what our customers like to call boot. 
In the second quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category, with global sales growing by more than 200% versus prior year, increasing customer basket size and expanding our gross margin rates..  This rapid growth was driven by our continued expansion of the category and GameStop stores, improved merchandising and marketing expertise in the category, developing exclusive products, leveraging recent comic events such as Comic Con, and exciting new product IP such as Minions, Inside Out, The Avengers Age of Ultron and Batman Arkham Knight. 
As mentioned on the last earnings calls, our sales have continued to climb on these new pricing, we are increasing this space devoted to the category in our markets. Our second wave within store expansion was completed in the second quarter, generating strong increases in loot sales as well as expanding our customer base and driving increased traffic in our stores.
Finally, due to the success of our new standalone retail concept dedicated to loot, we have continued to expand the zinc pop-culture pilot in Australia and other markets. We ended the second quarter with 14 stores in Australia and 1 store in Dublin. We will continue to expand this new concept in the second half of 2015 in other markets, including the United States, where we'll be opening our first location this fall under the brand name of ThinkGeek, leveraging the powerful brand of our recent acquisition of Geeknet. Mike Hogan will provide more details on his new business.
The expansion of this category continues to be met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers, and we expect continued strong sales growth in the second half of 2015, driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as Fall Out 4, Hunger Games Mocking Jay and Disney's upcoming blockbuster, Star Wars Episode 7, The Force Awakens, where we are seeing very strong preorders on exclusive loot offerings. For the year, we are targeting sales of $200 million to $250 million, not including ThinkGeek
We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales and margin growth and increasing relevance with our customers, and we expect this category to grow to an over $500 million business globally over the next 3 years.

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our recent acquisition of ThinkGeek, our progress to date and our plans. As discussed previously, GameStop initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new opportunities that can apply core games and capabilities to drive future growth and value, and Geeknet or ThinkGeek is a great example. We are expanding into a growing $20 billion [ph] worldwide category, where we can leverage our core strengths to drive non-gaming revenue growth and profitability. ThinkGeek provides a significant expansion of our global multichannel platform. We will utilize their product development and licensing expertise to broaden our collectibles product offering and deepen our existing customer relationships while adding new ones. It is worth noting the GameStop's global multichannel business posted 28% growth for the second quarter. Multichannel is a key growth driver, and we expect ThinkGeek to be a big part of continuing that growth.
Although the transaction closed in near 6 weeks ago, I'm happy to report the integration is off to a great start. We continue to see great value in this acquisition. I 
want to begin by sharing a few key facts regarding the GameStop and ThinkGeek customer base, where we see significant opportunity. GameStop customers are a great fit for collectibles. In a recent survey, 67% [ph] of GameStop customers indicated they plan to purchase collectibles in the next 12 months. This is a huge opportunity for us to tap into. Our PowerUp base aligns well in the category. 45% of PowerUp members have purchased collectibles in the past 6 months as compared to only 22% for all U.S. consumers.
And we see upside for these current buyers. While PowerUp members outstanding twice as much of collectibles as the average category buyer, ThinkGeek customers actually spent 4 times the average. We see significant upside for PowerUp members standing and for the category overall..  ThinkGeek is a powerful brands. 46% of PowerUp members are already familiar with the brand, doubled awareness for all our consumers. 
And finally, consumers are extremely satisfied with ThinkGeek, giving the brand of a impressive 60% Net Promoter Score.
Now a few thoughts on synergy and the growth opportunity. On the cost side, we are already seeing supply chain and purchasing synergies, some of which will positively impact the business in the current fiscal year. Geeknet posted an $8 million loss in fiscal 2014. We expect the business to already be profitable with the back half of this current year. There are a number of specific growth opportunities we are very excited about. 
Web traffic. We recently began highlighting a few ThinkGeek products on GameStop.com to preferred traffic. GameStop is already driving greater than 10% of total ThinkGeek traffic.
Profitable customers. GameStop provides a high-value customer for ThinkGeek, similar to what we have been successfully for Kongregate with mobile game purchasers. As for Kongregate, we expect traffic from GameStop to convert well above the average.
Web in-store. We have added a number of top-selling ThinkGeek products to our GameStop web in-store program. This allows customers and trimester starter products for home delivery. We just opened this up last week and here we have already sold out several key products.
Profitable promotions. GameStop and ThinkGeek collaborated to execute a 16th anniversary sale last week, which resulted in ThinkGeek's second highest gross margin date this year.
Pipeline. We expect significant growth in the back half of the year. We are excited about many exclusive new products, including a full line up in support of the new Star Wars movie.
International expansion. We are also excited about the potential for offering ThinkGeek products in our European stores. We have already begin to think the limited selection for the fall. ThinkGeek products are currently available in our Australian stores as well. As Mike Mauler mentioned, we'll have several ThinkGeek stores opening in the U.S. this fall and we will feature ThinkGeek heavily in our manager show in Las Vegas Mexico where we are pleased with the progress today, and we anticipate meeting or beating our initial synergy and growth expectation.
And finally, for those of you making up your holiday guest lists early, I wanted to highlight a few unique product that ThinkGeek will be featuring over the next few months. Don't miss out on the Star Wars R2-D2 bento box. The dead star waffle maker issue to be a hit are maybe a test the vacuum key wristwatch? Or the ever popular Knight Rider Kitt car charger. You can  all look forward to seeing one of these in your Christmas stocking.

As always, we are grateful to our associates around the world for their performance and dedication to customers this quarter. They are the secret to GameStop's success.
Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
We had a great quarter. Earnings per share growth was well ahead of consensus, growing 41% year-over-year. Our earnings per share grew 41% on top of 144% growth in last year's second quarter. So comps are strong in the video game business, delivering 8.1% on top of last year's 22% comp. Digital growth without FX was 17.5%, and preowned growth without FX was over 5%.
Technology Brands grew their store count by an impressive 182 stores, now standing at 731 stores. Spring Mobile is now AT&T's largest dealer, and our acquisition pipeline is full. Rob and Tony will provide color on the video game business and the Tech Brands metrics.
During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Geeknet and the ThinkGeek.com brand. We are very excited about this opportunity and have spent significant time with the Geeknet team on the integration plan. Mike Hogan will share some early color on our progress.
Our collectibles or loot business had a very good quarter. What was once an experiment in Australia a little over 2 years ago has turned into a global business that is feeding rapid growth. As we see opportunities, we will continue to remodel GameStop stores to give more linear footage to loot merchandise and less to video games, providing us a great competitive lever for the video game publishers. Integration with ThinkGeek will only help this business. Mike Mauler will update you on our global progress.
Last quarter's capital allocation was again disciplined as we paid our dividend of $0.36 per share and bought back 60.7 million worth of our stock.
Taking a moment to step back and look at the business. You have to recognize that we have a knack for identifying and developing opportunities in transformational technology and business acquisitions that are paying off for shareholders. Our early and rapid investments in refurbishing mobile devices has turned into our Technology Brands unit, the fastest-growing AT&T and Apple dealer in America. Our ability to adapt a great idea from Australia, adjust it to American consumers and roll it quickly, has turned into our strong lineup of loot and collectibles products. And our strong balance sheet allows us to capitalize on this success by rolling upgrade assets like Geeknet.
Our GameStop Technology Institute, announced in March of 2014, has developed an in-store tablet that is already rolling out nationally, and we have developed beacon solutions that will soon be implemented as well. Our digital solutions at DLC, Steam, full game download, Kongregate and Digital Game Informer, among others, are continuing to grow
and will provide a nice $ 1 billion business this year. 
Underpinning all of these great ideas is great execution and the PowerUp Rewards program. It is clear to us now that we are finding new uses for our brick-and-mortar stores as well as our websites. And behind them is probably our biggest asset, the customer data behind all our transactions. Our ability to diversify our business has been the correct strategy, building on our leadership in video games while exploiting our core to grow rapidly in digital, mobile and collectibles. 
In the most recent quarter alone, those new businesses accounted for almost 23% of our gross profit, and we expect to see that grow. You should note that our 32.9% gross margin rate for the second quarter was among the highest in our history, and gross profit dollars were a company record for the second quarter. 
Other categories like preowned may fluctuate depending on mix and promotions, but our ability to diversify into richer lines of business and products is allowing us to increase profitability.
We provided guidance for Q3 that is slightly down to modestly up and increased our full year guidance by the share count bought back in the quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so.
We continue to spend a lot of time internally and with our board on our strategic plan, assessing the size of markets and their adjacency to our core customer base. We seek more opportunities to leverage our core competencies of real estate, human talent, capital, buy-sell-trade and PowerUp Rewards into attractive new segments. A high rate of change will continue to define us and will protect our family. 
I will now turn the call over to Rob."

I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color on the quarter. Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue gro",1270,"Thanks, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color on the quarter. 
Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 1.8% in the quarter or 7.4%, excluding FX. Comparable store sales increased 8.1%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 500 basis points. Gross margins expanded 110 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and growth in collectibles, leading to record second quarter gross profit of $580.5 million. Adjusted operating earnings increased over 65% for the quarter, driven by our sales growth in collectibles and margin expansion in mobile.
During the quarter, we incurred onetime charges of $9.1 million, primarily relating to the Geeknet acquisition and Tech Brands expansion, which included RadioShack store acquisition costs. SG&A, adjusted to exclude charges, as a percentage of sales, was 27.3%, down slightly from 27.5% in the prior year quarter despite investments supporting Tech Brands expansion. Interest expense increased $4.5 million [ph] due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Adjusted net income increased 34.6%, and adjusted EPS increased over 40%. Foreign currency moves reduced sales nearly $100 million but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 2.2% but increased 3.7%, excluding FX, because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the U.S., we sold 42% more in next-gen consoles than in the second quarter of 2014, leading to the outperformance in the comp results.
Software sales declined 6.0% but increased 0.7%, excluding FX, as we overcame the comparison to Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8 from last year, with strong performance on Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight.
Preowned revenue grew 0.5% or plus 5.1%, excluding FX, as we saw continued growth in next-gen preowned hardware and software. Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, down 100 basis points from the prior year due to higher refurbishment costs on an increased mix of hardware and accessories trades, which were driven by the successful trade-up campaigns we ran during the quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 11.1% or 17.5%, excluding FX, to $199 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight. GAAP digital revenues declined 20.5% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis as we discussed in the first quarter call. Mobile revenues increased 26.9%, driven by a 62.3% growth in our Technology Brands revenues. And gross margins increased from 36.1% in Q2 last year to 45.4%.
As we stated on the last call, as we continue to rapidly expand our Tech Brands footprint, there will be upfront investment costs in order to ensure successful openings. This will impact short-term operating results but will ultimately provide sustainable profits for the company. 
During the second quarter, we invested over $5 million for the 89 stores we opened and for the 90 to 100 stores to be opened during the third quarter. Q2's Tech Brands store growth also included the acquisition of 3 AT&T resellers totaling 93 stores, most of which were acquired at the end of July. 
Revenues in the other category increased 37.7% to $99.4 million or 48.5% growth, excluding FX, as we continue to expand our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We closed a net of 33 video game stores around the world. As Paul mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Geeknet, including the ThinkGeek brands and e-commerce site. The acquisition cost was $126 million net of cash acquired. ThinkGeek will be accretive in the second half of the year. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million in stock or 1.41 million shares at an average price of $43.04. We surpassed the $1.8 billion mark in cumulative buybacks, with over 71 million shares acquired at an average price of $25.28. We remain committed to our buyback program and are on track to meet our 2015 objective of repurchasing at least $200 million of stock. We also paid the second quarter dividend at $0.36 per share. In the last 12 months, we've generated approximately $500 million in free cash flow and have returned $466 million in dividends and buybacks and have used an additional $247 million on acquisitions.
Now let's move on to third quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from plus 1% to plus 4% and revenue growth to range from flat to positive 4%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to again negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the third quarter of last year.
Again, this quarter, we expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically. The August title lineup is lighter than last year, with Madden being the only comparison. In September, we will be comping [indiscernible], which is a very tough overlap as this year's version is only an expansion pack. Assassin's Creed and Halo should give us a favorable comp in October. 
Due to our over-indexing in market share on Destiny from last year, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the third quarter. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Destiny were sold across 4 platforms in the third quarter of last year. This quarter's most anticipated title is expected to be Halo 5, which launches very late in the quarter and will only be available on 1 platform.
We also expect a slight decline on the preowned margin rate as the mix shifts to next-gen from prior gen and as we continue to invest in refurbishment of preowned consoles to support sales growth. Our repair costs remain comparable, while preowned hardware prices decline over time. Also, as a reminder, sales of next-gen preowned units have a lower overall margin than prior gen units due to higher trade-in prices, which is typical in a new console cycle. We are forecasting preowned margin to be between 44% and 46% for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect to expand gross margins compared to the prior year quarter as other areas of our business, such as mobile and collectibles, positively contribute to our profits. 
Despite the upfront investment to support store openings, which I described earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands in the third quarter are forecast to be comparable to the prior year quarter and are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter. We are guiding earnings per share for our third quarter to range from $0.53 to $0.60 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the third quarter of last year, and we will have approximately $0.02 per share in additional interest expense. You should model 106.7 million shares outstanding for the third quarter and $107 million for the full year based on buybacks through the end of the second quarter. For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 5%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 7%. After considering buybacks we have completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share to a higher range of $3.66 to $3.86 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

Our retail operations had another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on our unique specialty service model and grow our new preowned and digital video game business as well as our Technology Brands business. We believe that service matters, and our businesses are expanding because we meet the needs of our customers better than any of our competitors.
In new video games, we again increased share as our U.S. software grew 1.2% versus a decline in the overall market. Our software share increased by 1 point, and we continue to sell over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software.
Our U.S. new hardware dollar sales grew 13.6% during the quarter versus a decline in the overall market, resulting in 4 points of hardware market share gain during the quarter. The console launch remained strong in its 22nd month as we have tripled the number of PS4 units that were sold versus the PS3 launch and have nearly doubled the Xbox One units versus the 360 launch. Our preowned business outpaced the new business and grew during the quarter as we logged 0.5% growth after FX and 5% growth prior to the impact of FX. As is normal during this part of the launch cycle, our increasing mix of next-gen sales is driving this growth. 
We are also in a good inventory position as our preowned inventory dollars are up 6% over the same period last year, driven entirely by next-gen hardware and software growth. So we are well poised to achieve mid-single-digit global preowned growth for the full year.
Looking at digital. We again drove double-digit growth in non-GAAP digital receipts, which increased 17.5% before FX and 11.1% after FX. This growth was driven mainly by the increase in downloadable content that was sold with new game launches.
Kongregate will launch 7 new mobile games this quarter and is on track to grow mobile gaming revenues by approximately 50% for the full year. It is important to note that during the recent release of EA's Madden 16, we worked with our partners to offer a free physical game with the purchase of either a PS4 or Xbox One and did not carry the Xbox One digital bundle. We expect that if a game is provided as a promotional item in a hardware bundle, GameStop will see more of these physical offers than digital pack-ins on upcoming third-party releases.
In our Tech Brands segment, we continue to extend our sales leadership of AT&T and Apple's brands in a high service manner as our Technology Brands division is experiencing explosive growth. We continue to execute our strategy of rolling out smaller dealers to improve productivity and leveraging our real estate expertise and adding new locations. Our Technology Brands position has had a very productive summer, opening or acquiring 182 stores since the end of Q1. Our store count as of the end of Q2 stands at 731 stores. This represents a 129% increase in store count versus the end of Q2 2014. While we still plan on adding between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores this year, the bulk of our investment spending is behind us, and we anticipate seeing strong growth in the back half of the year, culminating in our Technology Brands' profits growing between 40% and 50% for the full year without infrastructure investment costs and 10% to 20% after such investment costs. This also sets us up for strong growth in 2016 and beyond.
Our Spring Mobile division is now not only the largest and fastest-growing AT&T dealer, but they continue to be the most productive dealer as well. Jason Ellis, our Senior Vice President of Technology Brands, and his team have done a great job of growing their business while maintaining a high service standard. We are also the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller and a top 5 Cricket dealer. 
In early August, we also began selling DIRECTV in all of our Spring Mobile stores, but we are now operating a full line of AT&T products and services in all of these stores. We are confident in our specialty retail expertise all of -- across all of our brands and optimistic about continued growth in the back half of the year and in 2016.
Finally, we leave this weekend for our annual store managers conference in Las Vegas, which will boast approximately 6,000 leaders from all of our companies and from around the world. We will have top leaders from all of our partners talking directly with our field leaders about their newest innovations and their plans for growth. The managers will also get hands-on experience on the latest innovations, most of which have never been seen by the public. This investment ensures that we will have the most knowledgeable sales team in our industries and allows us to continue to provide better service than our competition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Mauler."

Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations with record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q2 2014, led by our Australian business with a 2-point -- 10.2% same-store sales increase.
Driving our increase in international earnings was digital receipt growth of 20%, excluding FX, 30% e-commerce growth, excluding FX, driven by expanding web and store sales, and the continued expansion of licensed merchandise and collectibles or what our customers like to call loot. 
In the second quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category, with global sales growing by more than 200% versus prior year, increasing customer basket size and expanding our gross margin rates. This rapid growth was driven by our continued expansion of the category in GameStop stores, improved merchandising and marketing expertise in the category, developing exclusive products, leveraging recent fan events such as Comic-Con, and exciting new product IP such as Minions, Inside Out, The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Batman: Arkham Knight. 
As mentioned on the last earnings call, as sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. Our second wave of in-store expansion was completed in the second quarter, generating strong increases in loot sales as well as expanding our customer base and driving increased traffic in our stores.
Finally, due to the success of our new standalone retail concept dedicated to loot, we have continued to expand the ZiNG Pop Culture pilot in Australia and other markets. We ended the second quarter with 14 stores in Australia and 1 store in Dublin. We will continue to expand this new concept in the second half of 2015 in other markets, including the United States, where we'll be opening our first location this fall under the brand name of ThinkGeek, leveraging the powerful brand of our recent acquisition of Geeknet. Mike Hogan will provide more details on this new business.
The expansion of this category continues to be met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers, and we expect continued strong sales growth in the second half of 2015, driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as Fallout 4, Hunger Games: Mockingjay and Disney's upcoming blockbuster, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, where we are seeing very strong preorders on our exclusive loot offerings. For the year, we are targeting sales of $200 million to $250 million, not including ThinkGeek.
We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales and margin growth and increasing relevance with our customers, and we expect this category to grow to an over $500 million business globally over the next 3 years. 
And now I will turn it over to Mike Hogan."

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our recent acquisition of ThinkGeek, our progress to date and our plans. As discussed previously, GameStop initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new opportunities that can apply core GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value, and Geeknet or ThinkGeek is a great example. 
We are expanding into a growing $20 billion worldwide category, where we can leverage our core strengths to drive non-gaming revenue growth and profitability. ThinkGeek provides a significant expansion of our global multichannel platform. We will utilize their product development and licensing expertise to broaden our collectibles product offering and deepen our existing customer relationships while adding new ones. It is worth noting that GameStop's global multichannel business posted 28% growth for the second quarter. Multichannel is a key growth driver, and we expect ThinkGeek to be a big part of continuing that growth. Although the transaction closed in near 6 weeks ago, I'm happy to report the integration is off to a great start. We continue to see great value in this acquisition. 
I want to begin by sharing a few key facts regarding the GameStop and ThinkGeek customer base, where we see significant opportunity. GameStop customers are a great fit for collectibles. In a recent survey, 67% of GameStop customers indicated they plan to purchase collectibles in the next 12 months. This is a huge opportunity for us to tap into. Our PowerUp base aligns well with the category. 45% of PowerUp members have purchased collectibles in the past 6 months as compared to only 22% for all U.S. consumers.
And we see upside for these current buyers. While PowerUp members are spending twice as much on collectibles as the average category buyer, ThinkGeek customers actually spend 4x the average. We see significant upside for PowerUp members spending and for the category overall. 
ThinkGeek is a powerful brand. 46% of PowerUp members are already familiar with the brand, double the awareness for all consumers. 
And finally, consumers are extremely satisfied with ThinkGeek, giving the brand a very impressive 68% Net Promoter Score.
Now a few thoughts on synergy and the growth opportunity. On the cost side, we are already seeing supply chain and purchasing synergies, some of which will positively impact the business in the current fiscal year. Geeknet posted an $8 million loss in fiscal 2014. We expect the business to already be profitable with the back half of this current year. There are a number of specific growth opportunities we are very excited about. 
Web traffic. We recently began highlighting a few ThinkGeek products on Gamestop.com to refer traffic. GameStop is already driving greater than 10% of total ThinkGeek traffic.
Profitable customers. GameStop provides a high-value customer for ThinkGeek, similar to what we have done successfully for Kongregate with mobile game purchasers. As with Kongregate, we expect traffic from GameStop to convert well above the average.
Web in Store. We have added a number of top-selling ThinkGeek products to our GameStop Web in Store program. This allows customers in GameStop stores to order products for home delivery. We just opened this up last week, and we have already sold out of several key products.
Profitable promotions. GameStop and ThinkGeek collaborated to execute a 16th anniversary sale last week, which resulted in ThinkGeek's second highest gross margin day this year.
Pipeline. We expect significant growth in the back half of the year. We are excited about many exclusive new products, including a full lineup in support of the new Star Wars movie.
International expansion. We are also excited about the potential for offering ThinkGeek products in our European stores. We have already begun shipping a limited selection for the fall. ThinkGeek products are currently available in our Australian stores as well. As Mike Mauler mentioned, we will have several ThinkGeek stores opening in the U.S. this fall, and we will feature ThinkGeek heavily at our managers show in Las Vegas next week. We are very pleased with the progress to date, and we anticipate meeting or beating our initial synergy and growth expectation.
And finally, for those of you making up your holiday gifts list early, I wanted to highlight a few unique products that ThinkGeek will be featuring over the next few months. Don't miss out on the Star Wars R2-D2 bento box. The Death Star waffle maker is sure to be a hit. Or maybe a Tesla vacuum tube wristwatch. Or the ever popular Knight Rider KITT Car Charger. You can all look forward to seeing one of these in your Christmas stocking.
I will now turn it back over to Paul."

In terms of the games that we're very excited about, it's really the new -- some of the new IP or at least IP that hasn't been out for a little while. Halo 5 is launching. As Rob talked about, it's going to be stronger in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter because it launches so late in the third quarter. Call of Duty: Black Ops III, we're excited to see the 3-year development cycle, and so very excited about that game coming out. And Fallout 4, which is announced, is also a game that we're looking forward to. And then Star Wars Battlefront, which is a whole new IP.

As always, we are grateful to our associates around the world for their performance and dedication to customers this quarter. They are the secret to GameStop's success.
Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
We had a great quarter. Earnings per share growth was well ahead of consensus, growing 41% year-over-year. Our earnings per share grew 41% on top of 144% growth in the last year's second quarter. So comps are strong in the video game business, delivering 8.1% on top of last year's 22% comp. Digital growth without FX was 17.5%, and preowned growth without FX was over 5%.
Technology Brands grew their store count by an impressive 182 stores, now standing at 731 stores. Spring Mobile is now AT&T's largest dealer, and our acquisition pipeline is full. Rob and Tony will provide color on the video game business and the Tech Brands metrics.
During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Geeknet and the ThinkGeek.com brand. We are very excited about this opportunity and have spent significant time with the Geeknet team on the integration plan. Mike Hogan will share some early color on our progress.
Our collectibles or loot business had a very good quarter. What was once an experiment in Australia a little over 2 years ago has turned into a global business that is feeding rapid growth. As we see opportunities, we will continue to remodel GameStop stores to give more linear footage to loot merchandise and less to video games, providing us a great competitive lever for the video game publishers. Integration with ThinkGeek will only help this business. Mike Mauler will update you on our global progress.
Last quarter's capital allocation was again disciplined as we paid our dividend of $0.36 per share and bought back $60.7 million worth of our stock.
Taking a moment to step back and look at the business. You have to recognize that we have a knack for identifying and developing opportunities in transformational technology and business acquisitions that are paying off for shareholders. Our early and rapid investments in refurbishing mobile devices has turned into our Technology Brands unit, the fastest-growing AT&T and Apple dealer in America. Our ability to adapt a great idea from Australia, adjust it to American consumers and roll it quickly, has turned into our strong lineup of loot and collectibles products. And our strong balance sheet allows us to capitalize on this success by rolling upgrade assets like Geeknet.
Our GameStop Technology Institute, announced in March of 2014, has developed an in-store tablet that is already rolling out nationally, and we have developed beacon solutions that will soon be implemented as well. Our digital solutions of DLC, Steam, full game download, Kongregate and Digital Game Informer, among others, are continuing to grow and will provide a nice $ 1 billion business this year. 
Underpinning all of these great ideas is great execution and the PowerUp Rewards program. It is clear to us now that we are finding new uses for our brick-and-mortar stores as well as our websites. And behind them is probably our biggest asset, the customer data behind all our transactions. Our ability to diversify our business has been the correct strategy, building on our leadership in video games while exploiting our core to grow rapidly in digital, mobile and collectibles. 
In the most recent quarter alone, those new businesses accounted for almost 23% of our gross profit, and we expect to see that grow. You should note that our 32.9% gross margin rate for the second quarter was among the highest in our history, and gross profit dollars were a company record for the second quarter. 
Other categories like preowned may fluctuate depending on mix and promotions, but our ability to diversify into richer lines of business and products is allowing us to increase profitability.
We provided guidance for Q3 that is slightly down to modestly up and increased our full year guidance by the share count bought back in the quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so.
We continue to spend a lot of time internally and with our board on our strategic plan, assessing the size of markets and their adjacency to our core customer base. We seek more opportunities to leverage our core competencies of real estate, human talent, capital, buy-sell-trade and PowerUp Rewards into attractive new segments. A high rate of change will continue to define us and will protect our family. 
I will now turn the call over to Rob."

I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color on the quarter. Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue gro",1270,"Thanks, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color on the quarter. 
Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 1.8% in the quarter or 7.4%, excluding FX. Comparable store sales increased 8.1%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 500 basis points. Gross margins expanded 110 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and growth in collectibles, leading to record second quarter gross profit of $580.5 million. Adjusted operating earnings increased over 65% for the quarter, driven by our sales growth in collectibles and margin expansion in mobile.
During the quarter, we incurred onetime charges of $9.1 million, primarily relating to the Geeknet acquisition and Tech Brands expansion, which included RadioShack store acquisition costs. SG&A, adjusted to exclude charges, as a percentage of sales, was 27.3%, down slightly from 27.5% in the prior year quarter despite investments supporting Tech Brands expansion. Interest expense increased $4.5 million [ph] due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Adjusted net income increased 34.6%, and adjusted EPS increased over 40%. Foreign currency moves reduced sales nearly $100 million but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 2.2% but increased 3.7%, excluding FX, because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the U.S., we sold 42% more in next-gen consoles than in the second quarter of 2014, leading to the outperformance in the comp results.
Software sales declined 6.0% but increased 0.7%, excluding FX, as we overcame the comparison to Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8 from last year, with strong performance on Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight.
Preowned revenue grew 0.5% or plus 5.1%, excluding FX, as we saw continued growth in next-gen preowned hardware and software. Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, down 100 basis points from the prior year due to higher refurbishment costs on an increased mix of hardware and accessories trades, which were driven by the successful trade-up campaigns we ran during the quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 11.1% or 17.5%, excluding FX, to $199 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight. GAAP digital revenues declined 20.5% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis as we discussed in the first quarter call. Mobile revenues increased 26.9%, driven by a 62.3% growth in our Technology Brands revenues. And gross margins increased from 36.1% in Q2 last year to 45.4%.
As we stated on the last call, as we continue to rapidly expand our Tech Brands footprint, there will be upfront investment costs in order to ensure successful openings. This will impact short-term operating results but will ultimately provide sustainable profits for the company. 
During the second quarter, we invested over $5 million for the 89 stores we opened and for the 90 to 100 stores to be opened during the third quarter. Q2's Tech Brands store growth also included the acquisition of 3 AT&T resellers totaling 93 stores, most of which were acquired at the end of July. 
Revenues in the other category increased 37.7% to $99.4 million or 48.5% growth, excluding FX, as we continue to expand our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We closed a net of 33 video game stores around the world. As Paul mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Geeknet, including the ThinkGeek brands and e-commerce site. The acquisition cost was $126 million net of cash acquired. ThinkGeek will be accretive in the second half of the year. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million in stock or 1.41 million shares at an average price of $43.04. We surpassed the $1.8 billion mark in cumulative buybacks, with over 71 million shares acquired at an average price of $25.28. We remain committed to our buyback program and are on track to meet our 2015 objective of repurchasing at least $200 million of stock. We also paid the second quarter dividend at $0.36 per share. In the last 12 months, we've generated approximately $500 million in free cash flow and have returned $466 million in dividends and buybacks and have used an additional $247 million on acquisitions.
Now let's move on to third quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from plus 1% to plus 4% and revenue growth to range from flat to positive 4%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to again negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the third quarter of last year.
Again, this quarter, we expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically. The August title lineup is lighter than last year, with Madden being the only comparison. In September, we will be comping [indiscernible], which is a very tough overlap as this year's version is only an expansion pack. Assassin's Creed and Halo should give us a favorable comp in October. 
Due to our over-indexing in market share on Destiny from last year, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the third quarter. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Destiny were sold across 4 platforms in the third quarter of last year. This quarter's most anticipated title is expected to be Halo 5, which launches very late in the quarter and will only be available on 1 platform.
We also expect a slight decline on the preowned margin rate as the mix shifts to next-gen from prior gen and as we continue to invest in refurbishment of preowned consoles to support sales growth. Our repair costs remain comparable, while preowned hardware prices decline over time. Also, as a reminder, sales of next-gen preowned units have a lower overall margin than prior gen units due to higher trade-in prices, which is typical in a new console cycle. We are forecasting preowned margin to be between 44% and 46% for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect to expand gross margins compared to the prior year quarter as other areas of our business, such as mobile and collectibles, positively contribute to our profits. 
Despite the upfront investments to support store openings, which I described earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands in the third quarter are forecast to be comparable to the prior year quarter and are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter. We are guiding earnings per share for our third quarter to range from $0.53 to $0.60 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the third quarter of last year, and we will have approximately $0.02 per share in additional interest expense. You should model 106.7 million shares outstanding for the third quarter and 107 million for the full year based on buybacks through the end of the second quarter. For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 5%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 7%. After considering buybacks we have completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share to a higher range of $3.66 to $3.86 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

Our retail operations had another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on our unique specialty service model and grow our new preowned and digital video game business as well as our Technology Brands business. We believe that service matters, and our businesses are expanding because we meet the needs of our customers better than any of our competitors.
In new video games, we again increased share as our U.S. software grew 1.2% versus a decline in the overall market. Our software share increased by 1 point, and we continue to sell over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software.
Our U.S. new hardware dollar sales grew 13.6% during the quarter versus a decline in the overall market, resulting in 4 points of hardware market share gain during the quarter. The console launch remained strong in its 22nd month as we have tripled the number of PS4 units that were sold versus the PS3 launch and have nearly doubled the Xbox One units versus the 360 launch. Our preowned business outpaced the new business and grew during the quarter as we logged 0.5% growth after FX and 5% growth prior to the impact of FX. As is normal during this part of the launch cycle, our increasing mix of next-gen sales is driving this growth. 
We are also in a good inventory position as our preowned inventory dollars are up 6% over the same period last year, driven entirely by next-gen hardware and software growth. So we are well poised to achieve mid-single-digit global preowned growth for the full year.
Looking at digital. We again drove double-digit growth in non-GAAP digital receipts, which increased 17.5% before FX and 11.1% after FX. This growth was driven mainly by the increase in downloadable content that was sold with new game launches.
Kongregate will launch 7 new mobile games this quarter and is on track to grow mobile gaming revenues by approximately 50% for the full year. It is important to note that during the recent release of EA's Madden 16, we worked with our partners to offer a free physical game with the purchase of either a PS4 or Xbox One and did not carry the Xbox One digital bundle. We expect that if a game is provided as a promotional item in a hardware bundle, GameStop will see more of these physical offers than digital pack-ins on upcoming third-party releases.
In our Tech Brands segment, we continue to extend our sales leadership of AT&T and Apple's brands in a high service manner as our Technology Brands division is experiencing explosive growth. We continue to execute our strategy of rolling out smaller dealers to improve productivity and leveraging our real estate expertise and adding new locations. Our Technology Brands division has had a very productive summer, opening or acquiring 182 stores since the end of Q1. Our store count as of the end of Q2 stands at 731 stores. This represents a 129% increase in store count versus the end of Q2 2014. While we still plan on adding between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores this year, the bulk of our investment spending is behind us, and we anticipate seeing strong growth in the back half of the year, culminating in our Technology Brands' profits growing between 40% and 50% for the full year without infrastructure investment costs and 10% to 20% after such investment costs. This also sets us up for strong growth in 2016 and beyond.
Our Spring Mobile division is now not only the largest and fastest-growing AT&T dealer, but they continue to be the most productive dealer as well. Jason Ellis, our Senior Vice President of Technology Brands, and his team have done a great job of growing their business while maintaining a high service standard. We are also the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller and a top 5 Cricket dealer. 
In early August, we also began selling DIRECTV in all of our Spring Mobile stores, but we are now operating a full line of AT&T products and services in all of these stores. We are confident in our specialty retail expertise all of -- across all of our brands and optimistic about continued growth in the back half of the year and in 2016.
Finally, we leave this weekend for our annual store managers conference in Las Vegas, which will boast approximately 6,000 leaders from all of our companies and from around the world. We will have top leaders from all of our partners talking directly with our field leaders about their newest innovations and their plans for growth. The managers will also get hands-on experience on the latest innovations, most of which have never been seen by the public. This investment ensures that we will have the most knowledgeable sales team in our industries and allows us to continue to provide better service than our competition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Mauler."

Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations with record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q2 2014, led by our Australian business with a 2-point -- 10.2% same-store sales increase.
Driving our increase in international earnings was digital receipt growth of 20%, excluding FX, 30% e-commerce growth, excluding FX, driven by expanding web and store sales, and the continued expansion of licensed merchandise and collectibles or what our customers like to call loot. 
In the second quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category, with global sales growing by more than 200% versus prior year, increasing customer basket size and expanding our gross margin rates. This rapid growth was driven by our continued expansion of the category in GameStop stores, improved merchandising and marketing expertise in the category, developing exclusive products, leveraging recent fan events such as Comic-Con, and exciting new product IP such as Minions, Inside Out, the Avengers Age of Ultron and Batman: Arkham Knight. 
As mentioned on the last earnings call, as sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. Our second wave of in-store expansion was completed in the second quarter, generating strong increases in loot sales as well as expanding our customer base and driving increased traffic in our stores.
Finally, due to the success of our new standalone retail concept dedicated to loot, we have continued to expand the ZiNG Pop Culture pilot in Australia and other markets. We ended the second quarter with 14 stores in Australia and 1 store in Dublin. We will continue to expand this new concept in the second half of 2015 in other markets, including the United States, where we'll be opening our first location this fall under the brand name of ThinkGeek, leveraging the powerful brand of our recent acquisition of Geeknet. Mike Hogan will provide more details on this new business.
The expansion of this category continues to be met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers, and we expect continued strong sales growth in the second half of 2015, driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as Fallout 4, Hunger Games: Mockingjay and Disney's upcoming blockbuster, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, where we are seeing very strong preorders on our exclusive loot offerings. For the year, we are targeting sales of $200 million to $250 million, not including ThinkGeek.
We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales and margin growth and increasing relevance with our customers, and we expect this category to grow to an over $500 million business globally over the next 3 years. 
And now I will turn it over to Mike Hogan."

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our recent acquisition of ThinkGeek, our progress to date and our plans. As discussed previously, GameStop initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new opportunities that can apply core GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value, and Geeknet or ThinkGeek is a great example. 
We are expanding into a growing $20 billion worldwide category, where we can leverage our core strengths to drive non-gaming revenue, growth and profitability. ThinkGeek provides a significant expansion of our global multichannel platform. We will utilize their product development and licensing expertise to broaden our collectibles product offering and deepen our existing customer relationships while adding new ones. It is worth noting that GameStop's global multichannel business posted 28% growth for the second quarter. Multichannel is a key growth driver, and we expect ThinkGeek to be a big part of continuing that growth. Although the transaction closed in near 6 weeks ago, I'm happy to report the integration is off to a great start. We continue to see great value in this acquisition. 
I want to begin by sharing a few key facts regarding the GameStop and ThinkGeek customer base, where we see significant opportunity. GameStop customers are a great fit for collectibles. In a recent survey, 67% of GameStop customers indicated they plan to purchase collectibles in the next 12 months. This is a huge opportunity for us to tap into. Our PowerUp base aligns well with the category. 45% of PowerUp members have purchased collectibles in the past 6 months as compared to only 22% for all U.S. consumers.
And we see upside for these current buyers. While PowerUp members are spending twice as much on collectibles as the average category buyer, ThinkGeek customers actually spend 4x the average. We see significant upside for PowerUp member spending and for the category overall. 
ThinkGeek is a powerful brand. 46% of PowerUp members are already familiar with the brand, double the awareness for all consumers. 
And finally, consumers are extremely satisfied with ThinkGeek, giving the brand a very impressive 68% Net Promoter Score.
Now a few thoughts on synergy and the growth opportunity. On the cost side, we are already seeing supply chain and purchasing synergies, some of which will positively impact the business in the current fiscal year. Geeknet posted an $8 million loss in fiscal 2014. We expect the business to already be profitable with the back half of this current year. There are a number of specific growth opportunities we are very excited about. 
Web traffic. We recently began highlighting a few ThinkGeek products on Gamestop.com to refer traffic. GameStop is already driving greater than 10% of total ThinkGeek traffic.
Profitable customers. GameStop provides a high-value customer for ThinkGeek, similar to what we have done successfully for Kongregate with mobile game purchasers. As with Kongregate, we expect traffic from GameStop to convert well above the average.
Web in Store. We have added a number of top-selling ThinkGeek products to our GameStop Web in Store program. This allows customers in GameStop stores to order products for home delivery. We just opened this up last week, and we have already sold out of several key products.
Profitable promotions. GameStop and ThinkGeek collaborated to execute a 16th anniversary sale last week, which resulted in ThinkGeek's second highest gross margin day this year.
Pipeline. We expect significant growth in the back half of the year. We are excited about many exclusive new products, including a full lineup in support of the new Star Wars movie.
International expansion. We are also excited about the potential for offering ThinkGeek products in our European stores. We have already begun shipping a limited selection for the fall. ThinkGeek products are currently available in our Australian stores as well. As Mike Mauler mentioned, we will have several ThinkGeek stores opening in the U.S. this fall, and we will feature ThinkGeek heavily at our managers show in Las Vegas next week. We are very pleased with the progress to date, and we anticipate meeting or beating our initial synergy and growth expectation.
And finally, for those of you making up your holiday gifts list early, I wanted to highlight a few unique products that ThinkGeek will be featuring over the next few months. Don't miss out on the Star Wars R2-D2 bento box. The Death Star waffle maker is sure to be a hit. Or maybe a Tesla vacuum tube wristwatch. Or the ever popular Knight Rider KITT Car Charger. You can all look forward to seeing one of these in your Christmas stocking.
I will now turn it back over to Paul."

What we see though is that there's a tremendous adjacency between popular culture and video games. And if you remember back to our franchise marketing efforts that we did a few years ago, we know that when the consumer is at a launch, they want to get every kind of item they can related to that particular title. If you're in line for Batman, you want the Batman T-shirt, the game, the everything that there is. And of course, there's always been a lack of that merchandise.

As Rob talked about, it's going to be stronger in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter because it launches so late in the third quarter. Call of Duty: Black Ops III, we're excited to see the 3-year development cycle, and so very excited about that game coming out.

As always, we are grateful to our associates around the world for their performance and dedication to customers this quarter. They are the secret to GameStop's success.
Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
We had a great quarter. Earnings per share growth was well ahead of consensus, growing 41% year-over-year. Our earnings per share grew 41% on top of 144% growth in the last year's second quarter. So comps are strong in the video game business, delivering 8.1% on top of last year's 22% comp. Digital growth without FX was 17.5%, and preowned growth without FX was over 5%.
Technology Brands grew their store count by an impressive 182 stores, now standing at 731 stores. Spring Mobile is now AT&T's largest dealer, and our acquisition pipeline is full. Rob and Tony will provide color on the video game business and the Tech Brands metrics.
During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Geeknet and the ThinkGeek.com brand. We are very excited about this opportunity and have spent significant time with the Geeknet team on the integration plan. Mike Hogan will share some early color on our progress.
Our collectibles or loot business had a very good quarter. What was once an experiment in Australia a little over 2 years ago has turned into a global business that is feeding rapid growth. As we see opportunities, we will continue to remodel GameStop stores to give more linear footage to loot merchandise and less to video games, providing us a great competitive lever for the video game publishers. Integration with ThinkGeek will only help this business. Mike Mauler will update you on our global progress.
Last quarter's capital allocation was again disciplined as we paid our dividend of $0.36 per share and bought back $60.7 million worth of our stock.
Taking a moment to step back and look at the business. You have to recognize that we have a knack for identifying and developing opportunities in transformational technology and business acquisitions that are paying off for shareholders. Our early and rapid investments in refurbishing mobile devices has turned into our Technology Brands unit, the fastest-growing AT&T and Apple dealer in America. Our ability to adapt a great idea from Australia, adjust it to American consumers and roll it quickly, has turned into our strong lineup of loot and collectibles products. And our strong balance sheet allows us to capitalize on this success by rolling upgrade assets like Geeknet.
Our GameStop Technology Institute, announced in March of 2014, has developed an in-store tablet that is already rolling out nationally, and we have developed beacon solutions that will soon be implemented as well. Our digital solutions of DLC, Steam, full game download, Kongregate and Digital Game Informer, among others, are continuing to grow and will provide a nice $ 1 billion business this year. 
Underpinning all of these great ideas is great execution and the PowerUp Rewards program. It is clear to us now that we are finding new uses for our brick-and-mortar stores as well as our websites. And behind them is probably our biggest asset, the customer data behind all our transactions. Our ability to diversify our business has been the correct strategy, building on our leadership in video games while exploiting our core to grow rapidly in digital, mobile and collectibles. 
In the most recent quarter alone, those new businesses accounted for almost 23% of our gross profit, and we expect to see that grow. You should note that our 32.9% gross margin rate for the second quarter was among the highest in our history, and gross profit dollars were a company record for the second quarter. 
Other categories like preowned may fluctuate depending on mix and promotions, but our ability to diversify into richer lines of business and products is allowing us to increase profitability.
We provided guidance for Q3 that is slightly down to modestly up and increased our full year guidance by the share count bought back in the quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so.
We continue to spend a lot of time internally and with our board on our strategic plan, assessing the size of markets and their adjacency to our core customer base. We seek more opportunities to leverage our core competencies of real estate, human talent, capital, buy-sell-trade and PowerUp Rewards into attractive new segments. A high rate of change will continue to define us and will protect our family. 
I will now turn the call over to Rob."

I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color on the quarter. Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue gro",1270,"Thanks, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter, and then I'll dive into some color on the quarter. 
Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 1.8% in the quarter or 7.4%, excluding FX. Comparable store sales increased 8.1%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 500 basis points. Gross margins expanded 110 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and growth in collectibles, leading to record second quarter gross profit of $580.5 million. Adjusted operating earnings increased over 65% for the quarter, driven by our sales growth in collectibles and margin expansion in mobile.
During the quarter, we incurred onetime charges of $9.1 million, primarily relating to the Geeknet acquisition and Tech Brands expansion, which included RadioShack store acquisition costs. SG&A, adjusted to exclude charges, as a percentage of sales, was 27.3%, down slightly from 27.5% in the prior year quarter despite investments supporting Tech Brands expansion. Interest expense increased $4.5 million [ph] due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Adjusted net income increased 34.6%, and adjusted EPS increased over 40%. Foreign currency moves reduced sales nearly $100 million but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 2.2% but increased 3.7%, excluding FX, because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the U.S., we sold 42% more in next-gen consoles than in the second quarter of 2014, leading to the outperformance in the comp results.
Software sales declined 6.0% but increased 0.7%, excluding FX, as we overcame the comparison to Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8 from last year, with strong performance on Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight.
Preowned revenue grew 0.5% or plus 5.1%, excluding FX, as we saw continued growth in next-gen preowned hardware and software. Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, down 100 basis points from the prior year due to higher refurbishment costs on an increased mix of hardware and accessories trades, which were driven by the successful trade-up campaigns we ran during the quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 11.1% or 17.5%, excluding FX, to $199 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight. GAAP digital revenues declined 20.5% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis as we discussed in the first quarter call. Mobile revenues increased 26.9%, driven by a 62.3% growth in our Technology Brands revenues. And gross margins increased from 36.1% in Q2 last year to 45.4%.
As we stated on the last call, as we continue to rapidly expand our Tech Brands footprint, there will be upfront investment costs in order to ensure successful openings. This will impact short-term operating results but will ultimately provide sustainable profits for the company. 
During the second quarter, we invested over $5 million for the 89 stores we opened and for the 90 to 100 stores to be opened during the third quarter. Q2's Tech Brands store growth also included the acquisition of 3 AT&T resellers totaling 93 stores, most of which were acquired at the end of July. 
Revenues in the other category increased 37.7% to $99.4 million or 48.5% growth, excluding FX, as we continue to expand our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We closed a net of 33 video game stores around the world. As Paul mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Geeknet, including the ThinkGeek brands and e-commerce site. The acquisition cost was $126 million net of cash acquired. ThinkGeek will be accretive in the second half of the year. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million in stock or 1.41 million shares at an average price of $43.04. We surpassed the $1.8 billion mark in cumulative buybacks, with over 71 million shares acquired at an average price of $25.28. We remain committed to our buyback program and are on track to meet our 2015 objective of repurchasing at least $200 million of stock. We also paid the second quarter dividend at $0.36 per share. In the last 12 months, we've generated approximately $500 million in free cash flow and have returned $466 million in dividends and buybacks and have used an additional $247 million on acquisitions.
Now let's move on to third quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from plus 1% to plus 4% and revenue growth to range from flat to positive 4%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to again negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the third quarter of last year.
Again, this quarter, we expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically. The August title lineup is lighter than last year, with Madden being the only comparison. In September, we will be comping [indiscernible], which is a very tough overlap as this year's version is only an expansion pack. Assassin's Creed and Halo should give us a favorable comp in October. 
Due to our over-indexing in market share on Destiny from last year, we are expecting new software revenues to be down in the third quarter. According to NPD, in the U.S., nearly 3 million units of Destiny were sold across 4 platforms in the third quarter of last year. This quarter's most anticipated title is expected to be Halo 5, which launches very late in the quarter and will only be available on 1 platform.
We also expect a slight decline on the preowned margin rate as the mix shifts to next-gen from prior gen and as we continue to invest in refurbishment of preowned consoles to support sales growth. Our repair costs remain comparable, while preowned hardware prices decline over time. Also, as a reminder, sales of next-gen preowned units have a lower overall margin than prior gen units due to higher trade-in prices, which is typical in a new console cycle. We are forecasting preowned margin to be between 44% and 46% for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect to expand gross margins compared to the prior year quarter as other areas of our business, such as mobile and collectibles, positively contribute to our profits. 
Despite the upfront investments to support store openings, which I described earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands in the third quarter are forecast to be comparable to the prior year quarter and are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter. We are guiding earnings per share for our third quarter to range from $0.53 to $0.60 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the third quarter of last year, and we will have approximately $0.02 per share in additional interest expense. You should model 106.7 million shares outstanding for the third quarter and 107 million for the full year based on buybacks through the end of the second quarter. For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 5%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 7%. After considering buybacks we have completed thus far, we are raising our full year guidance from a range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share to a higher range of $3.66 to $3.86 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments."

In new video games, we again increased share as our U.S. software grew 1.2% versus a decline in the overall market. Our software share increased by 1 point, and we continue to sell over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software.
Our U.S. new hardware dollar sales grew 13.6% during the quarter versus a decline in the overall market, resulting in 4 points of hardware market share gain during the quarter. The console launch remained strong in its 22nd month as we have tripled the number of PS4 units that were sold versus the PS3 launch and have nearly doubled the Xbox One units versus the 360 launch. Our preowned business outpaced the new business and grew during the quarter as we logged 0.5% growth after FX and 5% growth prior to the impact of FX. As is normal during this part of the launch cycle, our increasing mix of next-gen sales is driving this growth. 
We are also in a good inventory position as our preowned inventory dollars are up 6% over the same period last year, driven entirely by next-gen hardware and software growth. So we are well poised to achieve mid-single-digit global preowned growth for the full year.
Looking at digital. We again drove double-digit growth in non-GAAP digital receipts, which increased 17.5% before FX and 11.1% after FX. This growth was driven mainly by the increase in downloadable content that was sold with new game launches.
Kongregate will launch 7 new mobile games this quarter and is on track to grow mobile gaming revenues by approximately 50% for the full year. It is important to note that during the recent release of EA's Madden 16, we worked with our partners to offer a free physical game with the purchase of either a PS4 or Xbox One and did not carry the Xbox One digital bundle. We expect that if a game is provided as a promotional item in a hardware bundle, GameStop will see more of these physical offers than digital pack-ins on upcoming third-party releases.
In our Tech Brands segment, we continue to extend our sales leadership of AT&T and Apple's brands in a high service manner as our Technology Brands division is experiencing explosive growth. We continue to execute our strategy of rolling out smaller dealers to improve productivity and leveraging our real estate expertise and adding new locations. Our Technology Brands division has had a very productive summer, opening or acquiring 182 stores since the end of Q1. Our store count as of the end of Q2 stands at 731 stores. This represents a 129% increase in store count versus the end of Q2 2014. While we still plan on adding between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores this year, the bulk of our investment spending is behind us, and we anticipate seeing strong growth in the back half of the year, culminating in our Technology Brands' profits growing between 40% and 50% for the full year without infrastructure investment costs and 10% to 20% after such investment costs. This also sets us up for strong growth in 2016 and beyond.
Our Spring Mobile division is now not only the largest and fastest-growing AT&T dealer, but they continue to be the most productive dealer as well. Jason Ellis, our Senior Vice President of Technology Brands, and his team have done a great job of growing their business while maintaining a high service standard. We are also the largest and fastest-growing Apple authorized reseller and a top 5 Cricket dealer. 
In early August, we also began selling DIRECTV in all of our Spring Mobile stores, but we are now operating a full line of AT&T products and services in all of these stores. We are confident in our specialty retail expertise all of -- across all of our brands and optimistic about continued growth in the back half of the year and in 2016.
Finally, we leave this weekend for our annual store managers conference in Las Vegas, which will boast approximately 6,000 leaders from all of our companies and from around the world. We will have top leaders from all of our partners talking directly with our field leaders about their newest innovations and their plans for growth. The managers will also get hands-on experience on the latest innovations, most of which have never been seen by the public. This investment ensures that we will have the most knowledgeable sales team in our industries and allows us to continue to provide better service than our competition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Mauler."

GameStop's international businesses had a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations with record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q2 2014, led by our Australian business with",462,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations with record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q2 2014, led by our Australian business with a 2-point -- 10.2% same-store sales increase.
Driving our increase in international earnings was digital receipt growth of 20%, excluding FX, 30% e-commerce growth, excluding FX, driven by expanding web and store sales, and the continued expansion of licensed merchandise and collectibles or what our customers like to call loot. 
In the second quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category, with global sales growing by more than 200% versus prior year, increasing customer basket size and expanding our gross margin rates. This rapid growth was driven by our continued expansion of the category in GameStop stores, improved merchandising and marketing expertise in the category, developing exclusive products, leveraging recent fan events such as Comic-Con, and exciting new product IP such as Minions, Inside Out, the Avengers Age of Ultron and Batman: Arkham Knight. 
As mentioned on the last earnings call, as sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. Our second wave of in-store expansion was completed in the second quarter, generating strong increases in loot sales as well as expanding our customer base and driving increased traffic in our stores.
Finally, due to the success of our new standalone retail concept dedicated to loot, we have continued to expand the ZiNG Pop Culture pilot in Australia and other markets. We ended the second quarter with 14 stores in Australia and 1 store in Dublin. We will continue to expand this new concept in the second half of 2015 in other markets, including the United States, where we'll be opening our first location this fall under the brand name of ThinkGeek, leveraging the powerful brand of our recent acquisition of Geeknet. Mike Hogan will provide more details on this new business.
The expansion of this category continues to be met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers, and we expect continued strong sales growth in the second half of 2015, driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as Fallout 4, Hunger Games: Mockingjay and Disney's upcoming blockbuster, Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, where we are seeing very strong preorders on our exclusive loot offerings. For the year, we are targeting sales of $200 million to $250 million, not including ThinkGeek.
We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales and margin growth and increasing relevance with our customers, and we expect this category to grow to an over $500 million business globally over the next 3 years. 
And now I will turn it over to Mike Hogan."

Paul asked me to comment briefly on our recent acquisition of ThinkGeek, our progress to date and our plans. As discussed previously, GameStop initiated a robust business development process a number of years ag",788,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Paul asked me to comment briefly on our recent acquisition of ThinkGeek, our progress to date and our plans. As discussed previously, GameStop initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new opportunities that can apply core GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value, and Geeknet or ThinkGeek is a great example. 
We are expanding into a growing $20 billion worldwide category, where we can leverage our core strengths to drive non-gaming revenue, growth and profitability. ThinkGeek provides a significant expansion of our global multichannel platform. We will utilize their product development and licensing expertise to broaden our collectibles product offering and deepen our existing customer relationships while adding new ones. It is worth noting that GameStop's global multichannel business posted 28% growth for the second quarter. Multichannel is a key growth driver, and we expect ThinkGeek to be a big part of continuing that growth. Although the transaction closed in near 6 weeks ago, I'm happy to report the integration is off to a great start. We continue to see great value in this acquisition. 
I want to begin by sharing a few key facts regarding the GameStop and ThinkGeek customer base, where we see significant opportunity. GameStop customers are a great fit for collectibles. In a recent survey, 67% of GameStop customers indicated they plan to purchase collectibles in the next 12 months. This is a huge opportunity for us to tap into. Our PowerUp base aligns well with the category. 45% of PowerUp members have purchased collectibles in the past 6 months as compared to only 22% for all U.S. consumers.
And we see upside for these current buyers. While PowerUp members are spending twice as much on collectibles as the average category buyer, ThinkGeek customers actually spend 4x the average. We see significant upside for PowerUp member spending and for the category overall. 
ThinkGeek is a powerful brand. 46% of PowerUp members are already familiar with the brand, double the awareness for all consumers. 
And finally, consumers are extremely satisfied with ThinkGeek, giving the brand a very impressive 68% Net Promoter Score.
Now a few thoughts on synergy and the growth opportunity. On the cost side, we are already seeing supply chain and purchasing synergies, some of which will positively impact the business in the current fiscal year. Geeknet posted an $8 million loss in fiscal 2014. We expect the business to already be profitable with the back half of this current year. There are a number of specific growth opportunities we are very excited about. 
Web traffic. We recently began highlighting a few ThinkGeek products on Gamestop.com to refer traffic. GameStop is already driving greater than 10% of total ThinkGeek traffic.
Profitable customers. GameStop provides a high-value customer for ThinkGeek, similar to what we have done successfully for Kongregate with mobile game purchasers. As with Kongregate, we expect traffic from GameStop to convert well above the average.
Web in Store. We have added a number of top-selling ThinkGeek products to our GameStop Web in Store program. This allows customers in GameStop stores to order products for home delivery. We just opened this up last week, and we have already sold out of several key products.
Profitable promotions. GameStop and ThinkGeek collaborated to execute a 16th anniversary sale last week, which resulted in ThinkGeek's second highest gross margin day this year.
Pipeline. We expect significant growth in the back half of the year. We are excited about many exclusive new products, including a full lineup in support of the new Star Wars movie.
International expansion. We are also excited about the potential for offering ThinkGeek products in our European stores. We have already begun shipping a limited selection for the fall. ThinkGeek products are currently available in our Australian stores as well. As Mike Mauler mentioned, we will have several ThinkGeek stores opening in the U.S. this fall, and we will feature ThinkGeek heavily at our managers show in Las Vegas next week. We are very pleased with the progress to date, and we anticipate meeting or beating our initial synergy and growth expectation.
And finally, for those of you making up your holiday gifts list early, I wanted to highlight a few unique products that ThinkGeek will be featuring over the next few months. Don't miss out on the Star Wars R2-D2 bento box. The Death Star waffle maker is sure to be a hit. Or maybe a Tesla vacuum tube wristwatch. Or the ever popular Knight Rider KITT Car Charger. You can all look forward to seeing one of these in your Christmas stocking.
I will now turn it back over to Paul."

What we see though is that there's a tremendous adjacency between popular culture and video games. And if you remember back to our franchise marketing efforts that we did a few years ago, we know that when the consumer is at a launch, they want to get every kind of item they can related to that particular title. If you're in line for Batman, you want the Batman T-shirt, the game, the everything that there is. And of course, there's always been a lack of that merchandise.

But I just want to be sure you're still comfortable with the mid-single-digit growth number, x FX, of course. That's my first question. And then on the used category, I heard you talk about the extra refurbishment costs related to the hardware side and also how the next-gen category has slightly lower margins.

We thank our associates around the world for their efforts this quarter and especially want to recognize our associates in Micro Mania in France for the challenges they are facing, all of GameStop stands with you. We are watching events in France and Europe carefully, and we will react as events unfold.
Joining me today on our call are: Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
While diluted earnings per share was within our range, the quarter was challenging due to underperformance of Halo and Assassin's Creed late in the quarter and lack of sales acceleration from hardware price cuts during the quarter. There has been some discussion of Halo being a large full game download title, but our research indicates it performed at about the same level as other titles Tony will reconcile that data in his remarks.
On a more positive note, our preowned business had another good growth quarter at 4.9%, well ahead of overall software growth. In constant currency, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter for positive growth for preowned. We expect preowned to be at plan this year with solid growth in the fourth quarter.
Our digital business grew 13.8% in constant currency and is on track to achieve over $1 billion in receipts this year. Our collectibles or loot business also had nice growth, on track to reaching $300 million in sales this year and expanding our gross margin rate by 150 basis points in the other category. We also now have 22 loot stores open around the world and 2 ThinkGeek stores in the U.S., one in Orlando, Florida and one in Palisades, New York, a third ThinkGeek store will open soon right here in Texas.
Tech Brands continues to expand rapidly as we invest to build toward our goal of $1.5 billion in revenues by 2019. During the quarter, sales grew 64% and helped drive gross profit dollar growth of 81% in the mobile and consumer electronics segments.
We acquired 21 AT&T resellers stores during this quarter and another 87 at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Reseller acquisitions for the year totaled 239 stores or $112 million.
We continue to seize opportunities to grow this business by reinvesting into more acquisitions in the highly fragmented dealer space. Our relationships with AT&T and Apple are strong.
Overall, we believe GameStop's redeployment of cash flows from our video games businesses into adjacent retailing categories is the right strategy. This strategy builds on our core competencies in real estate, human talent, ability to deploy capital effectively, buy, sell, trade and PowerUp Rewards. In total, revenues from nonphysical gaming now comprise 17% of sales and 26% of gross profit, up from 23% last quarter, and these areas continue to grow rapidly.
Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen some disruption in our shares, but we encourage investors to stay the course. GameStop achieved record third quarter gross profit, and we expanded our gross margin 280 basis points on the strength of non-video game categories. Since November, 2013, our overall gross margin rate has expanded by 400 basis points. GameStop continues to have dominant share in the video game space, and we are focused on continuing to generate positive returns through diversification into other attractive segments. We have reconfirmed guidance for the fourth quarter and are fully prepared for the upcoming holiday season.
I will now turn the call over to Rob."

Sales decreased 3.6% in the quarter, but grew 1.2%, excluding FX. Comparable store sales decreased 1.1% due primarily to slower-than-expected hardware sales. Gross margins expanded 280 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and collectibles.
SG&A as a percentage of sales increased from 23.6% in the prior year quarter to 26.1% due to investments supporting Tech Brands expansion. I'll provide more color on that shortly.
Interest expense increased $3.4 million because the $350 million in debt was outstanding for the entire quarter this year versus a few weeks last year. Adjusted net income decreased 11.4%, and adjusted EPS decreased 5.3% due to the decrease in sales and gross profit in the video game segments and due to investments supporting Tech Brands expansion.
Foreign currency movement reduced sales by approximately $100 million and reduced EPS by $0.02 when compared to last year.
Now I'll recap sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 20.4% or 15.4% excluding FX because of the reduction in price on the PS4 in October and the Xbox One late last year and because of the overlap of the Destiny bundle, which drove a 147% increase in new hardware in Q3 2014.
Software sales declined 9.3% or 4.2% excluding FX because of the overlap of Destiny. Preowned revenue grew 0.6% or plus 4.9% excluding FX as we saw continued growth in next-gen hardware and software.
Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, at the high end of the guidance we gave on our last call. Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 8.7% or 13.8% excluding FX to $228.6 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of digital content for Destiny: The Taken King. GAAP digital revenues declined 27.1% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis. We will overlap that change in accounting for Kongregate in the fourth quarter.
Mobile revenues increased 31.1% driven by a 64.2% growth in our Technology Brands revenues to $140.1 million, and gross margins increased from 40.1% in Q3 last year to 55.4% as Tech Brands becomes a greater portion of the mix in this category and as margin rates in the Tech Brands business continue to expand.
We continue to invest in Tech Brands store growth. During the third quarter, we incurred $5.9 million in preopening costs for the 79 stores opened and the 40-or-so stores to be opened during the fourth quarter. The RadioShack and GameStop conversions are taking longer than we anticipated to open, and the payroll carrying costs, preopening rent and normal ramp-to-store profitability are impacting our Tech Brands results. As a result, the $6.5 million of operating income generated was less than we expected, an EPS impact of $0.02 to $0.03. But we expect significant profit growth from Tech Brands in the fourth quarter as the bulk of the openings and conversions are behind us.
Revenues in the other category increased 60.8% to $138.3 million, driven by sales of interactive toys in the growth of our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We close a net of 19 video game stores around the world; we opened 8 collectibles stores during the quarter; we repurchased $44.9 million in stock in the quarter or 1.02 million shares at an average price of $43.85.
Now let's move on to fourth quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from negative 1% to plus 6% and revenue growth to range from flat to plus 6%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by $120 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year and will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 more than we planned earlier this year. We expect to continue to expand gross margins compared to the prior year quarter as our mobile and collectibles businesses continue to grow.
As I stated earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter. We are guiding EPS for the fourth quarter to range from $2.12 to $2.32 per share and reiterating our full year guidance of $3.66 to $3.86 per share.
You should model 106 million shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and 107 million for the full year based on buyback through the end of the third quarter.
For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 3%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 6%.
I'll now turn it over to Tony for his comments."
1342560,315848608,907451,"GameStop Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2015",2015-11-23,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you Rob. As Paul mentioned, new hardware sales slowed in the final months of the quarter, causing us to miss our comp guidance. We have seen that rebound in the week since as consumers waited for key gains such as Activision's Call of Duty: Black Op",910,"Thank you Rob. As Paul mentioned, new hardware sales slowed in the final months of the quarter, causing us to miss our comp guidance. We have seen that rebound in the week since as consumers waited for key gains such as Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Fallout 4 and EA's Star Wars Battlefront to purchase their hardware. Sales of Microsoft, Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 are up 31% during the first 2 weeks of November.
We continue to dominate the new console cycle, selling over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software generating a 53% share during the quarter. However, Halo 5 and Assassin's Creed syndicate sell short of our expectations. The recent launches of Activision's Call of Duty Black Ops 3 and Bethesda's Fallout 4 met our initial expectations, while EA's Star Wars Battlefront fell short of expectations. Our preowned sales grew 4.9% during the quarter before the impact of FX, outpacing overall sales by 3.7 points and new software sales by 9.1 points. In addition, we accomplished this growth with minimal promotional activity, generating a higher-than-expected 46% margin rate for our preowned business.
We have provided Slide 15 in our investor packet, which shows the variance in growth rates of the new and preowned U.S. segments for next-generation and current-generation software. As you can see, preowned sales growth on next-generation software of 88% outpaced new software growth of 38%. Likewise, the sales decline in current-generation preowned software of 27% was less than the decline in new software of 65%.
Consumers are using our trade promotions to fund their purchases of new software and hardware, providing us with a strong inventory position of in-demand games in hardware. Our PS4 and Xbox One preowned inventory has grown 44% compared to where it was this time last year. This gives us the opportunity to provide more value through promotions in the fourth quarter.
We expect to end the year with preowned growth in the mid-single-digits before FX for the full year.
Our non-GAAP digital receipts grew 13.8% prior to FX and 8.7% after FX, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of digital receipts for the full year. Downloadable content of Destiny The Taken King and Steam Wallet revenues provided the majority of the growth during the quarter.
The Microsoft announcement that they had sold $400 million of Halo 5, coupled with an NPD report that only reported $119 million of U.S. Halo merchandise has caused some to posit that digital sales are much higher on this title than on other previous launches. We are in constant discussion with all publishers and platform holders, and we believe that all major full game titles launched in this quarter were in line with previously announced digital download levels.
The variance to NPD is reconciled by global sales not reported by NPD, a broader inclusion of SKUs beyond those tracked by NPD, 2 additional days of sales in Microsoft's announcement period versus NPD's reporting period and sales that we're reported by publishers but not reported by retailers.
I will now share some data and color about the performance of our non-gaming segments. Our high-growth category such as digital, loot and Technology Brands grew convincingly during the quarter and now represents more than 1/4 of our Q3 gross margin dollars.
In the quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category with global sales increasing by 384% versus prior year. Loot also helped drive an increase in store traffic, customer basket size and gross margin rate. We expect this category to grow to $300 million in sales for the fiscal year.
This rapid growth is being driven by leveraging our newly acquired ThinkGeek business, securing a growing number of exclusive products and having a broad assortment of well-known IPs such as Star Wars, Call of Duty and Fallout that have strong appeal with our customer base.
During the corridor, we made great strides in integrating ThinkGeek's capabilities into GameStop's growing omni-channel business, and we continued to expand zing stores internationally and in the U.S. under the ThinkGeek brand name, ending the quarter with 22 stores, including one in the U.S. We expect to end fiscal 2015 with approximately 37 stores nationwide -- worldwide.
Our Technology Brands stores are offering the hottest technology this holiday season and providing great service. In addition to our rapid growth, we continue to be the most productive AT&T dealer as well as a top-performing authorized Apple reseller. As of the end of the third quarter, we had 834 Technology Brands stores, an increase of 104% over Q3 of 2014. Including 2 acquisitions that we closed on November 1, we've opened 193 new stores consisting of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and Greenfield stores and acquired 239 stores year-to-date.
Given the constantly changing nature of compensation programs from our partners, the best way to understand growth in the Technology Brands segment is to look at gross profit dollars. During Q3, Tech Brands drove the 81% growth profit dollar growth in the mobile and CE category. We expect for gross profit dollars to increase between 85% and 95% in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we see solid demand for our video game products during the fourth quarter and our digital, loot and Technology Brands businesses will provide sales and profit growth, giving us confidence to achieve our fourth quarter guidance and to provide strong growth for 2016 as well.
With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Paul."

In terms of trade-in pricing, no, actually we're finding the we do not need to increase our trade-in pricing. We have been promotional, but it's within our trade price.

We thank our associates around the world for their efforts this quarter and especially want to recognize our associates in Micromania in France for the challenges they are facing. All of GameStop stands with you. We are watching events in France and Europe carefully, and we will react as events unfold.
Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
While diluted earnings per share was within our range, the quarter was challenging due to underperformance of Halo and Assassin's Creed late in the quarter and lack of sales acceleration from hardware price cuts during the quarter. There has been some discussion of Halo being a large full-game download title, but our research indicates it performed at about the same level as other titles. Tony will reconcile that data in his remarks.
On a more positive note, our preowned business had another good growth quarter at 4.9%, well ahead of overall software growth. In constant currency, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth for preowned. We expect preowned to be at plan this year with solid growth in the fourth quarter.
Our digital business grew 13.8% in constant currency and is on track to achieve over $1 billion in receipts this year.
Our collectibles or loot business also had nice growth, on track to reaching $300 million in sales this year and expanding our gross margin rate by 150 basis points in the other category. We also now have 22 loot stores open around the world and 2 ThinkGeek stores in the U.S., one in Orlando, Florida, and one in Palisades, New York. A third ThinkGeek store will open soon right here in Texas.
Tech Brands continues to expand rapidly as we invest to build toward our goal of $1.5 billion in revenues by 2019. During the quarter, sales grew 64% and helped drive gross profit dollar growth of 81% in the mobile and consumer electronics segment.
We acquired 21 AT&T reseller stores during this quarter and another 87 at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Reseller acquisitions for the year totaled 239 stores or $112 million.
We continue to seize opportunities to grow this business by reinvesting into more acquisitions in the highly fragmented dealer space. Our relationships with AT&T and Apple are strong.
Overall, we believe GameStop's redeployment of cash flows from our video games businesses into adjacent retailing categories is the right strategy. This strategy builds on our core competencies in real estate, human talent, ability to deploy capital effectively, buy, sell, trade and PowerUp Rewards. In total, revenues from nonphysical gaming now comprise 17% of sales and 26% of gross profit, up from 23% last quarter, and these areas continue to grow rapidly.
Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen some disruption in our shares, but we encourage investors to stay the course. GameStop achieved record third quarter gross profit, and we expanded our gross margin 280 basis points on the strength of non-video game categories. Since November 2013, our overall gross margin rate has expanded by 400 basis points. GameStop continues to have dominant share in the video game space, and we are focused on continuing to generate positive returns through diversification into other attractive segments. We have reconfirmed guidance for the fourth quarter and are fully prepared for the upcoming holiday season.
I will now turn the call over to Rob."

We're in the room here getting a lot of air-conditioner noise or heating noise. If that's coming through, I apologize for that. I'll start today by covering the results of the third quarter.
Sales decreased 3.6% in the quarter but grew 1.2%, excluding FX. Comparable store sales decreased 1.1% due primarily to slower-than-expected hardware sales. Gross margins expanded 280 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and collectibles.
SG&A as a percentage of sales increased from 23.6% in the prior year quarter to 26.1% due to investments supporting Tech Brands expansion. I'll provide more color on that shortly.
Interest expense increased $3.4 million because the $350 million in debt was outstanding for the entire quarter this year versus a few weeks last year.
Adjusted net income decreased 11.4%, and adjusted EPS decreased 5.3% due to the decrease in sales and gross profit in the video game segments and due to investments supporting Tech Brands expansion.
Foreign currency movement reduced sales by approximately $100 million and reduced EPS by $0.02 when compared to last year.
Now I'll recap sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 20.4% or 15.4% excluding FX because of the reduction in price on the PS4 in October and the Xbox One late last year and because of the overlap of the Destiny bundle, which drove a 147% increase in new hardware in Q3 2014.
Software sales declined 9.3% or 4.2% excluding FX because of the overlap of Destiny.
Preowned revenue grew 0.6% or plus 4.9% excluding FX as we saw continued growth in next-gen preowned hardware and software.
Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, at the high end of the guidance we gave on our last call.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 8.7% or 13.8% excluding FX to $228.6 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of digital content for Destiny: The Taken King. GAAP digital revenues declined 27.1% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis. We will overlap that change in accounting for Kongregate in the fourth quarter.
Mobile revenues increased 31.1%, driven by a 64.2% growth in our Technology Brands revenues, to $140.1 million. And gross margins increased from 40.1% in Q3 last year to 55.4% as Tech Brands becomes a greater portion of the mix in this category and as margin rates in the Tech Brands business continue to expand.
We continue to invest in Tech Brands store growth. During the third quarter, we incurred $5.9 million in preopening costs for the 79 stores opened and the 40-or-so stores to be opened during the fourth quarter. The RadioShack and GameStop conversions are taking longer than we anticipated to open, and the payroll carrying costs, preopening rent and normal ramp-to-store profitability are impacting our Tech Brands results. As a result, the $6.5 million of operating income generated was less than we expected, an EPS impact of $0.02 to $0.03. But we expect significant profit growth from Tech Brands in the fourth quarter as the bulk of the openings and conversions are behind us.
Revenues in the other category increased 60.8% to $138.3 million, driven by sales of interactive toys and the growth of our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We closed a net of 19 video game stores around the world. We opened 8 collectibles stores during the quarter. We repurchased $44.9 million in stock in the quarter or 1.02 million shares at an average price of $43.85.
Now let's move on to fourth quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from negative 1% to plus 6% and revenue growth to range from flat to plus 6%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by $120 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year and will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 more than we planned earlier this year. We expect to continue to expand gross margins compared to the prior year quarter as our mobile and collectibles businesses continue to grow.
As I stated earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter.
We are guiding EPS for the fourth quarter to range from $2.12 to $2.32 per share and reiterating our full year guidance of $3.66 to $3.86 per share.
You should model 106 million shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and 107 million for the full year based on buyback through the end of the third quarter.
For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 3%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 6%.
I'll now turn it over to Tony for his comments."
1342560,315848608,907480,"GameStop Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2015",2015-11-23,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. As Paul mentioned, new hardware sales slowed in the final month of the quarter, causing us to miss our comp guidance. We have seen that rebound in the week since as consumers waited for key games such as Activision's Call of Duty: Black Op",910,"Thank you, Rob. As Paul mentioned, new hardware sales slowed in the final month of the quarter, causing us to miss our comp guidance. We have seen that rebound in the week since as consumers waited for key games such as Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Bathesda's Fallout 4 and EA's Star Wars Battlefront to purchase their hardware. Sales of Microsoft, Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 are up 31% during the first 2 weeks of November.
We continue to dominate the new console cycle, selling over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software, generating a 53% share during the quarter. However, Halo 5 and Assassin's Creed Syndicate fell short of our expectations. The recent launches of Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Bethesda's Fallout 4 met our initial expectations, while EA's Star Wars Battlefront fell short of expectations.
Our preowned sales grew 4.9% during the quarter before the impact of FX, outpacing overall sales by 3.7 points and new software sales by 9.1 points. In addition, we accomplished this growth with minimal promotional activity, generating a higher-than-expected 46% margin rate for our preowned business.
We have provided Slide 15 in our investor packet, which shows the variance in growth rates of the new and preowned U.S. segments for next-generation and current-generation software. As you can see, preowned sales growth on next-generation software of 88% outpaced new software growth of 38%. Likewise, the sales decline in current-generation preowned software of 27% was less than the decline in new software of 65%.
Consumers are using our trade promotions to fund their purchases of new software and hardware, providing us with a strong inventory position of in-demand games and hardware. Our PS4 and Xbox One preowned inventory has grown 44% compared to where it was this time last year. This gives us the opportunity to provide more value through promotions in the fourth quarter.
We expect to end the year with preowned growth in the mid-single-digits before FX for the full year.
Our non-GAAP digital receipts grew 13.8% prior to FX and 8.7% after FX, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of digital receipts for the full year. Downloadable content of Destiny: The Taken King and Steam Wallet revenues provided the majority of the growth during the quarter.
The Microsoft announcement that they have sold $400 million of Halo 5, coupled with an NPD report that only reported $119 million of U.S. Halo merchandise, has caused some to posit that digital sales are much higher on this title than on other previous launches. We are in constant discussion with all publishers and platform holders, and we believe that all major full-game titles launched in this quarter were in line with previously announced digital download levels.
The variance to NPD is reconciled by global sales not reported by NPD, a broader inclusion of SKUs beyond those tracked by NPD, 2 additional days of sales in Microsoft's announcement period versus NPD's reporting period and sales that were reported by publishers but not reported by retailers.
I will now share some data and color about the performance of our non-gaming segments. Our high-growth category such as digital, loot and Technology Brands grew convincingly during the quarter and now represent more than 1/4 of our Q3 gross margin dollars.
In the quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category, with global sales increasing by 384% versus prior year. Loot also helped drive an increase in store traffic, customer basket size and gross margin rate. We expect this category to grow to $300 million in sales for the fiscal year.
This rapid growth is being driven by leveraging our newly acquired ThinkGeek business, securing a growing number of exclusive products and having a broad assortment of well-known IPs such as Star Wars, Call of Duty and Fallout that have strong appeal with our customer base.
During the quarter, we made great strides in integrating ThinkGeek's capabilities into GameStop's growing omni-channel business, and we continued to expand ZiNG stores internationally and in the U.S. under the ThinkGeek brand name, ending the quarter with 22 stores, including 1 in the U.S. We expect to end fiscal 2015 with approximately 37 stores nationwide -- worldwide.
Our Technology Brands stores are offering the hottest technology this holiday season and providing great service. In addition to our rapid growth, we continue to be the most productive AT&T dealer as well as a top-performing authorized Apple reseller. As of the end of the third quarter, we had 834 Technology Brands stores, an increase of 104% over Q3 of 2014. Including 2 acquisitions that we closed on November 1, we've opened 193 new stores consisting of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and greenfield stores and acquired 239 stores year-to-date.
Given the constantly changing nature of compensation programs from our partners, the best way to understand growth in the Technology Brands segment is to look at gross profit dollars. During Q3, Tech Brands drove the 81% gross profit dollar growth in the mobile and CE category. We expect for gross profit dollars to increase between 85% and 95% in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we see solid demand for our video game products during the fourth quarter, and our digital, loot and Technology Brands businesses will provide sales and profit growth, giving us confidence to achieve our fourth quarter guidance and to provide strong growth for 2016 as well.
With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Paul."

We watched the Tech Brands' performance in several categories, including the core stores that we acquired, stores that were added as whitespace or conversion stores, by type of store, meaning the RadioShack versus other whitespace versus GameStop conversions. We analyze those by year of opening. We analyze each of the acquisitions individually against the pro formas that were created behind them. And other than the store opening cadence being slower than we had anticipated in the conversion cadence, we're very pleased with the base stores. We're very pleased with the whitespace stores that were opened in late '13 and in '14. We're pleased with the performance of the stores we opened in '15. It's just that they're going slower than we expected. And we remain very pleased with the performance of the acquisitions that we have made as well.

So there's no doubt that our digital attach is much higher than last time it launched when we launched 360 and PS3. But combined, we're at similar levels to what we were at this time in the cycle last launch. In terms of trade-in pricing, no. Actually, we're finding that we do not need to increase our trade-in pricing. We have been promotional, but it's within our trade price. And I think what you're seeing is that consumers are finding the straight prices. We're using powerful words and very powerful way to make sure that people are aware of that, and we've had some very successful promotions that have gotten us flushed with in-demand Xbox One and PS4 inventory for the fourth quarter, so we're excited that we were able to do that without increasing trade-in prices."

We thank our associates around the world for their efforts this quarter, and especially want to recognize our associates at Micromania in France for the challenges they are facing. All of GameStop stands with you. We are watching events in France and Europe carefully, and we will react as events unfold.
Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. Stores; and Matt Hodges, our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
While diluted earnings per share was within our range, the quarter was challenging due to underperformance of Halo and Assassin's Creed late in the quarter and lack of sales acceleration from hardware price cuts during the quarter. There has been some discussion of Halo being a large full-game download title, but our research indicates it performed at about the same level as other titles. Tony will reconcile that data in his remarks.
On a more positive note, our preowned business had another good growth quarter at 4.9%, well ahead of overall software growth. In constant currency, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth for preowned. We expect preowned to be at plan this year with solid growth in the fourth quarter.
Our digital business grew 13.8% in constant currency and is on track to achieve over $1 billion in receipts this year.
Our collectibles or loot business also had nice growth, on track to reaching $300 million in sales this year and expanding our gross margin rate by 150 basis points in the other category. We also now have 22 loot stores open around the world and 2 ThinkGeek stores in the U.S., one in Orlando, Florida, and one in Palisades, New York. A third ThinkGeek store will open soon right here in Texas.
Tech Brands continues to expand rapidly as we invest to build toward our goal of $1.5 billion in revenues by 2019. During the quarter, sales grew 64% and helped drive gross profit dollar growth of 81% in the mobile and consumer electronics segment.
We acquired 21 AT&T reseller stores during this quarter and another 87 at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Reseller acquisitions for the year totaled 239 stores or $112 million.
We continue to seize opportunities to grow this business by reinvesting into more acquisitions in the highly fragmented dealer space. Our relationships with AT&T and Apple are strong.
Overall, we believe GameStop's redeployment of cash flows from our video games businesses into adjacent retailing categories is the right strategy. This strategy builds on our core competencies in real estate, human talent, ability to deploy capital effectively, buy, sell, trade and PowerUp Rewards. In total, revenues from nonphysical gaming now comprise 17% of sales and 26% of gross profit, up from 23% last quarter, and these areas continue to grow rapidly.
Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen some disruption in our shares, but we encourage investors to stay the course. GameStop achieved record third quarter gross profit, and we expanded our gross margin 280 basis points on the strength of non-video game categories. Since November 2013, our overall gross margin rate has expanded by 400 basis points. GameStop continues to have dominant share in the video game space, and we are focused on continuing to generate positive returns through diversification into other attractive segments. We have reconfirmed guidance for the fourth quarter and are fully prepared for the upcoming holiday season.
I will now turn the call over to Rob."

We're in the room here getting a lot of air-conditioner noise or heating noise. If that's coming through, I apologize for that. I'll start today by covering the results of the third quarter.
Sales decreased 3.6% in the quarter, but grew 1.2% excluding FX. Comparable store sales decreased 1.1% due primarily to slower-than-expected hardware sales. Gross margins expanded 280 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and collectibles.
SG&A as a percentage of sales increased from 23.6% in the prior-year quarter to 26.1% due to investments supporting Tech Brands expansion. I'll provide more color on that shortly.
Interest expense increased $3.4 million because the $350 million in debt was outstanding for the entire quarter this year versus a few weeks last year.
Adjusted net income decreased 11.4%, and adjusted EPS decreased 5.3% due to the decrease in sales and gross profit in the video game segments and due to investments supporting Tech Brands expansion.
Foreign currency movement reduced sales by approximately $100 million and reduced EPS by $0.02 when compared to last year.
Now I'll recap sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 20.4%, or 15.4% excluding FX, because of the reduction in price on the PS4 in October and the Xbox One late last year and because of the overlap of the Destiny bundle, which drove a 147% increase in new hardware in Q3 2014.
Software sales declined 9.3%, or 4.2% excluding FX, because of the overlap of Destiny.
Preowned revenue grew 0.6%, or plus 4.9% excluding FX, as we saw continued growth in next-gen preowned hardware and software.
Preowned margin rates were 46.0%, at the high end of the guidance we gave on our last call.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 8.7%, or 13.8% excluding FX, to $228.6 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of digital content for Destiny: The Taken King. GAAP digital revenues declined 27.1% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis. We will overlap that change in accounting for Kongregate in the fourth quarter.
Mobile revenues increased 31.1%, driven by a 64.2% growth in our Technology Brands revenues to $140.1 million. And gross margins increased from 40.1% in Q3 last year to 55.4% as Tech Brands becomes a greater portion of the mix in this category and as margin rates in the Tech Brands business continue to expand.
We continue to invest in Tech Brands store growth. During the third quarter, we incurred $5.9 million in preopening costs for the 79 stores opened and the 40-or-so stores to be opened during the fourth quarter. The RadioShack and GameStop conversions are taking longer than we anticipated to open, and the payroll carrying costs, preopening rent and normal ramp to store profitability are impacting our Tech Brands results. As a result, the $6.5 million of operating income generated was less than we expected, an EPS impact of $0.02 to $0.03. But we expect significant profit growth from Tech Brands in the fourth quarter as the bulk of the openings and conversions are behind us.
Revenues in the other category increased 60.8% to $138.3 million, driven by sales of interactive toys and the growth of our collectibles business.
Some other data points are as follows: We closed a net of 19 video game stores around the world. We opened 8 collectibles stores during the quarter. We repurchased $44.9 million in stock in the quarter or 1.02 million shares at an average price of $43.85.
Now let's move on to fourth quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from negative 1% to plus 6% and revenue growth to range from flat to plus 6%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to negatively impact revenues by $120 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year and will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 more than we planned earlier this year. We expect to continue to expand gross margins compared to the prior-year quarter as our mobile and collectibles businesses continue to grow.
As I stated earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter.
We are guiding EPS for the fourth quarter to range from $2.12 to $2.32 per share and reiterating our full year guidance of $3.66 to $3.86 per share.
You should model 106 million shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and 107 million for the full year based on buybacks through the end of the third quarter.
For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 3%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 6%.
I'll now turn it over to Tony for his comments."
1342560,315848608,907521,"GameStop Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2015",2015-11-23,"Earnings Calls","GameStop Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. As Paul mentioned, new hardware sales slowed in the final month of the quarter, causing us to miss our comp guidance.

As Paul mentioned, new hardware sales slowed in the final month of the quarter, causing us to miss our comp guidance. We have seen that rebound in the weeks since as consumers waited for key games such as Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Bethesda's Fallout 4 and EA's Star Wars Battlefront to purchase their hardware. Sales of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 are up 31% during the first 2 weeks of November.
We continue to dominate the new console cycle, selling over 1/2 of all Xbox One and PS4 software, generating a 53% share during the quarter. However, Halo 5 and Assassin's Creed Syndicate fell short of our expectations. The recent launches of Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Bethesda's Fallout 4 met our initial expectations, while EA's Star Wars Battlefront fell short of expectations.
Our preowned sales grew 4.9% during the quarter before the impact of FX, outpacing overall sales by 3.7 points and new software sales by 9.1 points. In addition, we accomplished this growth with minimal promotional activity, generating a higher-than-expected 46% margin rate for our preowned business.
We have provided Slide 15 in our investor packet, which shows the variance in growth rates of the new and preowned U.S. segments for next-generation and current-generation software. As you can see, preowned sales growth on next-generation software of 88% outpaced new software growth of 38%. Likewise, the sales decline in current-generation preowned software of 27% was less than the decline in new software of 65%.
Consumers are using our trade promotions to fund their purchases of new software and hardware, providing us with a strong inventory position of in-demand games and hardware. Our PS4 and Xbox One preowned inventory has grown 44% compared to where it was this time last year. This gives us the opportunity to provide more value through promotions in the fourth quarter.
We expect to end the year with preowned growth in the mid-single-digits before FX for the full year.
Our non-GAAP digital receipts grew 13.8% prior to FX and 8.7% after FX, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of digital receipts for the full year. Downloadable content of Destiny: The Taken King and Steam Wallet revenues provided the majority of the growth during the quarter.
The Microsoft announcement that they have sold $400 million of Halo 5, coupled with an NPD report that only reported $119 million of U.S. Halo merchandise, has caused some to posit that digital sales are much higher on this title than on other previous launches. We are in constant discussion with all publishers and platform holders, and we believe that all major full-game titles launched in this quarter were in line with previously announced digital download levels.
The variance to NPD is reconciled by global sales not reported by NPD, a broader inclusion of SKUs beyond those tracked by NPD, 2 additional days of sales in Microsoft's announcement period versus NPD's reporting period and sales that were reported by publishers but not reported by retailers.
I will now share some data and color about the performance of our non-gaming segments. Our high-growth categories such as digital, loot and Technology Brands grew convincingly during the quarter and now represent more than 1/4 of our Q3 gross margin dollars.
In the quarter, loot was our fastest-growing sales category, with global sales increasing by 384% versus prior year. Loot also helped drive an increase in store traffic, customer basket size and gross margin rate. We expect this category to grow to $300 million in sales for the fiscal year.
This rapid growth is being driven by leveraging our newly acquired ThinkGeek business, securing a growing number of exclusive products and having a broad assortment of well-known IP such as Star Wars, Call of Duty and Fallout that have strong appeal with our customer base.
During the quarter, we made great strides in integrating ThinkGeek's capabilities into GameStop's growing omni-channel business, and we continued to expand ZiNG stores internationally and in the U.S. under the ThinkGeek brand name, ending the quarter with 22 stores, including 1 in the U.S. We expect to end fiscal 2015 with approximately 37 stores nationwide -- worldwide.
Our Technology Brands stores are offering the hottest technology this holiday season and providing great service. In addition to our rapid growth, we continue to be the most productive AT&T dealer as well as a top-performing authorized Apple reseller. As of the end of the third quarter, we had 834 Technology Brands stores, an increase of 104% over Q3 of 2014. Including 2 acquisitions that we closed on November 1, we've opened 193 new stores consisting of RadioShack conversions, GameStop conversions and greenfield stores and acquired 239 stores year-to-date.
Given the constantly changing nature of compensation programs from our partners, the best way to understand growth in the Technology Brands segment is to look at gross profit dollars. During Q3, Tech Brands drove the 81% gross profit dollar growth in the mobile and CE category. We expect for gross profit dollars to increase between 85% and 95% in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we see solid demand for our video game products during the fourth quarter, and our digital, loot and Technology Brands businesses will provide sales and profit growth, giving us confidence to achieve our fourth quarter guidance and to provide strong growth for 2016 as well.
With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Paul."

Actually, we're finding that we do not need to increase our trade-in pricing. We have been promotional, but it's within our trade price.
