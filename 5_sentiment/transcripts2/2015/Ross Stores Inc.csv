Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2014 performance, followed by our outlook for 2015. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings, both of which were well ahead of our expectations as our value offering on a wide assortment of name brand bargains and gifts resonated well with our customers. 
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 18% to $1.20, up from $1.02 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $249 million, up from $218 million last year.  Sales rose 11% for the quarter to $3,033,000,000, with comparable store sales up 6% over the prior year. 
For the 2014 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $4.42, up from $3.88 in 2013. Net earnings in fiscal 2014 grew to $925 million on sales of $11,042,000,000 with comparable store sales up 3% for the year. 
Like Ross, same-store sales at dd's DISCOUNTS posted solid gains for the quarter and for the year as their customers responded favorably to dd's value offering.  As a result, dd's DISCOUNTS was able to deliver another year of solid growth in ongoing operating profit in 2014. 
The strength in merchandising geographic sale trends for Ross during the fourth quarter were relatively broad-based. 
Juniors continue to be the best performing category for both the quarter and the full year, while the Midwest was the strongest region from both periods. 
Our fourth quarter operating margin rose 45 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from slightly higher merchandise gross margin and leverage on expenses from our robust comparable store sales gain. 
In addition, operating markets for the full year increased 13% -- 13% to 13.5%. 
As we ended 2014, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over the prior year while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventory compared to 49% last year.  Average in-store inventories were down approximately 3% at the end of 2014. 
As noted in today's release, our Board recently approved a new program to repurchase $1.4 billion of common stock over the next 2 years through fiscal 2016. This represents a 27% increase over the prior 2-year, $1.1 billion program that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. 
The Board also recently approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.235 per share, up 18% on top of an 18% increase in the prior year. The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend program has been driven by the significant amount of cash our business generate after funding store expansion and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and this is the 21st consecutive annual increase in our cash dividend.  This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2014 results and details on fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 6% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transaction and an increase in the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara noted, fourth quarter operating margin grew 45 basis points to 13.1%. Cost to goods sold was flat to last year with merchandise gross margin increasing 10 basis points. 
Occupancy levered by 15 basis points and freight declined by 10 basis points. Distribution expenses were also lower by 10 basis points due to the timing of packaway costs. These favorable trends were offset by a 45-basis point increase in buying expenses, mainly driven by higher incentive and severance costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 45 basis points during the period, mainly due to leverage on the 6% same-store sales increase. 
During the fourth quarter, we bought back 1.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $132 million, which completed our 2-year, $1.1 billion stock repurchase program. 
For the year, we repurchased a total of 7.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $550 million. 
Let's turn now to our 2015 guidance. As noted in today's press release, while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to remain somewhat cautious in our outlook due to a combination of ongoing volatility in the macroeconomic and retail climates, as well as our own tough multi-year comparisons. 
In addition, our 2015 guidance incorporates pressure on earnings from recent infrastructure investments we've been making to support our long-term growth. 
As a result, for fiscal 2015, we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.80, up 4% to 9% from $4.42 in fiscal 2014. 
The operating statement assumptions for the full year in 2015 are as follows: Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We are planning to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
Operating margin for 2015 is projected to be 13.3% to 13.5% versus 13.5% in fiscal 2014. This reflects our plans for a slight increase in merchandise margin that is expected to be offset by some deleveraging on operating costs if same-store sales are up 1% to 2%. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $14 million, which includes the impact from our bond offering in last year's third quarter. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 204 million. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 are projected to be about $450 million, down from $650 million in 2014 when we purchased our New York buying office. 
Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is expected to be approximately $340 million, up from $290 million in 2014. 
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 2015 first quarter, we are targeting earnings per share to be $1.21 to $1.26, up from $1.15 in the first quarter of 2014 following on the assumptions that supports this range. Total sales are projected to increase 6% to 7% over the prior year. This sales growth is based on our plans to open 32 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS with same-store sales projected to increase 2% to 3% on top of a 1% increase in last year's first quarter. 
If sales are within this range, we would expect first quarter operating margin of 14.6% to 14.8% compared to last year's 14.6%. 
In addition, we're planning about $4 million in net interest expense in the first quarter. 
Our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be about 206 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our ongoing ability to deliver compelling bargains on wide assortments of fresh and exciting name-brand fashions for the family and the home resulted in another year of solid sales and earnings growth in 2014. 
For the balance of 2015, we will continue to focus on the initiatives that have driven our success over the past several years. 
First, our top priority will always be delivering the best value possible to our customers. As a result, we will continue to make strategic investments in and merchandising. The people and processes of this critical organization are key to gaining access to the most desirable name-brand products available in the marketplace. 
Second, we will continue to operate our business with lien selling store inventory level. Over the past several years, we have reduced in-store inventories by more than 40%, which has contributed to improved sales and gross margin. Again, in 2015, we are planning selling store inventories to be down slightly on top of this multi-year decline. 
And finally, we will continue to maintain tight expense control in our distribution center, stores organizations and back-office functions. This will help drive profitability while still enabling us to invest in most vital areas of our business to support our long-term growth. 
We believe the ongoing execution of these initiatives will result in respectable sales and earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance",557,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with the review of our fourth quarter and 2014 performance, followed by our outlook for 2015. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings, both of which were well ahead of our expectations as our value offering on a wide assortment of name brand bargains and gifts resonated well with our customers. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 18% to $1.20, up from $1.02 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $249 million, up from $218 million last year. Sales rose 11% for the quarter to $3,033,000,000 with comparable store sales up 6% over the prior year.
For the 2014 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $4.42, up from $3.88 in 2013. Net earnings in fiscal 2014 grew to $925 million on sales of $11,042,000,000 with comparable store sales up 3% for the year. Like Ross, same-store sales at dd's DISCOUNTS posted solid gains for the quarter and for the year as their customers responded favorably to dd's value offering. As a result, dd's DISCOUNTS was able to deliver another year of solid growth in ongoing operating profit in 2014.
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the fourth quarter were relatively broad based. Juniors continue to be the best performing category for both the quarter and the full year, while the Midwest was the strongest region for both periods. Our fourth quarter operating margin rose 45 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from slightly higher merchandise gross margin and leverage on expenses from our robust comparable store sales gain. In addition, operating margin for the full year increased 13% -- 13 points to 13.5%.
As we ended 2014, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over the prior year while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventory compared to 49% last year. Average in-store inventories were down approximately 3% at the end of 2014. 
As noted in today's release, our board recently approved a new program to repurchase $1.4 billion of common stock over the next 2 years through fiscal 2016. This represents a 27% increase over the prior 2-year $1.1 billion program that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also recently approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.235 per  share, up 18% on top of an 18% increase in the prior year.
The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend program has been driven by the significant amount of cash our business generates after funding store expansion and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993, and this is the 21st consecutive annual increase in our cash dividend. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2014 results and details on fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 6% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transactions and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, fourth quarter operating margin grew 45 basis points to 13.1%. Cost of goods sold was flat to last year with merchandise gross margin increasing 10 basis points.
Occupancy levered by 15 basis points and freight declined by 10 basis points. Distribution expenses were also lower by 10 basis points due to timing of packaway costs. These favorable trends were offset by a 45 basis point increase in buying expenses mainly driven by higher incentive and severance costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 45 basis points during the period mainly due to leverage on the 6% same-store sales increase.
During the fourth quarter, we bought back 1.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $132 million, which completed our 2-year $1.1 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 7.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $550 million.
Let's turn now to our 2015 guidance. As noted in today's press release, while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to remain somewhat cautious in our outlook due to a combination of ongoing volatility in the macroeconomic and retail climates as well as our own tough multi-year comparisons. In addition, our 2015 guidance incorporates pressure on earnings from recent infrastructure investments we've been making to support our long-term growth. As a result, for fiscal 2015, we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.80, up 4% to 9% from $4.42 in fiscal 2014.
The operating statement assumptions for the full year in 2015 are as follows. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We are planning to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Operating margin for 2015 is projected to be 13.3% to 13.5% versus 13.5% in fiscal 2014. This reflects our plans for a slight increase in merchandise margin that is expected to be offset by some deleveraging on operating costs if same-store sales are up 1% to 2%.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $14 million, which includes the impact from our bond offering in last year's third quarter. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 204 million.
Capital expenditures in 2015 are projected to be about $450 million, down from $650 million in 2014 when we purchased our New York buying office. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is expected to be approximately $340 million, up from $290 million in 2014.
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 2015 first quarter, we are targeting earnings per share to be $1.21 to $1.26, up from $1.15 in the first quarter of 2014. Following are the assumptions that supports this range. Total sales are projected to increase 6% to 7% over the prior year. This sales growth is based on our plans to open 32 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS with same-store sales projected to increase 2% to 3% on top of a 1% increase in last year's first quarter. If sales are within this range, we would expect first quarter operating margin of 14.6% to 14.8% compared to last year's 14.6%. In addition, we're planning about $4 million in net interest expense in the first quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be about 206 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our ongoing ability to deliver compelling bargains on wide assortments of fresh and exciting name brand fashions for the family and the home resulted in another year of solid sales and earnings growth in 2014. For the balance of 2015, we will continue to focus on the initiatives that have driven our success over the past several years.
First, our top priority will always be delivering the best values possible to our customers. As a result, we will continue to make strategic investments in merchandising. The people and processes of this critical organization are key to gaining access to the most desirable name brand products available in the marketplace.
Second, we will continue to operate our business with lean selling store inventory levels. Over the past several years, we have reduced in-store inventories by more than 40%, which has contributed to improved sales and gross margins. Again, in 2015, we are planning selling store inventories to be down slightly on top of this multiyear decline.
And finally, we will continue to maintain tight expense control in our distribution centers, stores organizations and back-office functions. This has helped drive profitability while still enabling us to invest in the most vital areas of our business to support our long-term growth. We believe the ongoing execution of these initiatives will result in respectable sales and earnings growth in 2015 and beyond.

Obviously, those announcements are fairly recent. But we would expect that they will have an impact on wage -- on industry wage rates. Of course, they will. In fact, we'd expect the labor market will tighten up in general as the economy improves. We evaluate labor market trends over time and that will include looking at these recent announcements. And typically, we set rates on a market-by-market basis, and we'll certainly make adjustments to keep our wage rates competitive. It's very important that we continue to attract and retain great people. I should say that as we always do, if we do make changes, we'll look to mitigate the impact of any cost increases through reductions or productivity improvements elsewhere in the business. Just one final thought though, I think it's worth noting that rising wage rate is actually -- it's a good thing in the sense that it shows that the economy is picking up and suggest the consumer will have more money in their pockets. So it could have a beneficial impact to retail sales."

It's really the second bucket that we look out over the landscape. We don't see anything specific, but the environment continues to be fairly uncertain and volatile in terms of the macro economy in the retail sector. And we have our own fairly tough multiyear comparisons that we're up against. So it's really those 2 main factors that cause us to be a little bit conservative. And as you've certainly heard us talk about in the past, we feel like managing our business conservatively works for us no matter what happens. If the market is weak or promotional, it allows us to protect earnings. If the market is stronger, we've shown, for example, in the most recent quarter, we've shown our ability to chase earnings -- to chase business."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with the review of our fourth quarter and 2014 performance, followed by our outlook for 2015. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings, both of which were well ahead of our expectations as our value offering on a wide assortment of name brand bargains and gifts resonated well with our customers. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 18% to $1.20, up from $1.02 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $249 million, up from $218 million last year. Sales rose 11% for the quarter to $3,033,000,000 with comparable store sales up 6% over the prior year.
For the 2014 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $4.42, up from $3.88 in 2013. Net earnings in fiscal 2014 grew to $925 million on sales of $11,042,000,000 with comparable store sales up 3% for the year. Like Ross, same-store sales at dd's DISCOUNTS posted solid gains for the quarter and for the year as their customers responded favorably to dd's value offering. As a result, dd's DISCOUNTS was able to deliver another year of solid growth in ongoing operating profit in 2014.
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the fourth quarter were relatively broad based. Juniors continue to be the best performing category for both the quarter and the full year, while the Midwest was the strongest region for both periods. Our fourth quarter operating margin rose 45 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from slightly higher merchandise gross margin and leverage on expenses from our robust comparable store sales gain. In addition, operating margin for the full year increased 13% -- 13 points to 13.5%.
As we ended 2014, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over the prior year while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventory compared to 49% last year. Average in-store inventories were down approximately 3% at the end of 2014. 
As noted in today's release, our board recently approved a new program to repurchase $1.4 billion of common stock over the next 2 years through fiscal 2016. This represents a 27% increase over the prior 2-year $1.1 billion program that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also recently approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.235 per share, up 18% on top of an 18% increase in the prior year.
The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend program has been driven by the significant amounts of cash our business generates after funding store expansion and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993, and this is the 21st consecutive annual increase in our cash dividend. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2014 results and details on fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter guidance."

Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 6% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transactions and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, fourth quarter operating margin gre",653,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 6% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transactions and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, fourth quarter operating margin grew 45 basis points to 13.1%. Cost of goods sold was flat to last year with merchandise gross margin increasing 10 basis points.
Occupancy levered by 15 basis points and freight declined by 10 basis points. Distribution expenses were also lower by 10 basis points due to the timing of packaway costs. These favorable trends were offset by a 45 basis point increase in buying expenses mainly driven by higher incentive and severance costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 45 basis points during the period mainly due to leverage on the 6% same-store sales increase.
During the fourth quarter, we bought back 1.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $132 million, which completed our 2-year $1.1 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 7.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $550 million.
Let's turn now to our 2015 guidance. As noted in today's press release, while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to remain somewhat cautious in our outlook due to a combination of ongoing volatility in the macroeconomic and retail climates as well as our own tough multi-year comparisons. In addition, our 2015 guidance incorporates pressure on earnings from recent infrastructure investments we've been making to support our long-term growth. As a result, for fiscal 2015, we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.80, up 4% to 9% from $4.42 in fiscal 2014.
The operating statement assumptions for the full year in 2015 are as follows. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We are planning to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Operating margin for 2015 is projected to be 13.3% to 13.5% versus 13.5% in fiscal 2014. This reflects our plans for a slight increase in merchandise margin that is expected to be offset by some deleveraging on operating costs if same-store sales are up 1% to 2%.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $14 million, which includes the impact from our bond offering in last year's third quarter. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 204 million.
Capital expenditures in 2015 are projected to be about $450 million, down from $650 million in 2014 when we purchased our New York buying office. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is expected to be approximately $340 million, up from $290 million in 2014.
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 2015 first quarter, we are targeting earnings per share to be $1.21 to $1.26, up from $1.15 in the first quarter of 2014. Following are the assumptions that support this range. Total sales are projected to increase 6% to 7% over the prior year. This sales growth is based on our plans to open 32 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS with same-store sales projected to increase 2% to 3% on top of a 1% increase in last year's first quarter. If sales are within this range, we would expect first quarter operating margin of 14.6% to 14.8% compared to last year's 14.6%. In addition, we're planning about $4 million in net interest expense in the first quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be about 206 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To sum up, our ongoing ability to deliver compelling bargains on wide assortments of fresh and exciting name brand fashions for the family and the home resulted in another year of solid sales and earnings growth in 2014. For the balance of 2015, we will continue to focus on the initiatives that have driven our success over the past several years.
First, our top priority will always be delivering the best values possible to our customers. As a result, we will continue to make strategic investments in merchandising. The people and processes of this critical organization are key to gaining access to the most desirable name brand products available in the marketplace.
Second, we will continue to operate our business with lean selling store inventory levels. Over the past several years, we have reduced in-store inventories by more than 40%, which has contributed to improved sales and gross margins. Again, in 2015, we are planning selling store inventories to be down slightly on top of these multiyear declines.
And finally, we will continue to maintain tight expense control in our distribution centers, stores organizations and back-office functions. This has helped drive profitability while still enabling us to invest in the most vital areas of our business to support our long-term growth. We believe the ongoing execution of these initiatives will result in respectable sales and earnings growth in 2015 and beyond.
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

I think we put a figure out there a few years ago now of 500 stores that we thought dd's was capable of getting up to a 500 store number. It's currently 150. We opened around about just a little over 20 stores last year. We'll open a similar number this year. So we continue to be very positive about dd's' outlook."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2015 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our better-than-expected first quarter sales and earnings. Our results continue to benefit from value-focused customers responding favorably to our fresh and exciting assortments of name brand bargains. 
Earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.37, up $1.15 in the prior year. 
Net earnings for the quarter grew to $282 million compared to $244 million for the same period last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.04 per share, mainly from the favorable timing of packaway-related costs that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. 
Adjusting for this expense timing, first quarter 2015 earnings per share rose 16% over the prior year period. Sales rose 10% for the quarter to $2,938,000,000 with comparable store sales up 5% over the prior year. 
Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter as customers continue to respond positively to their value offering. 
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the first quarter were relatively broad-based. Juniors continues to be the best performing category during the quarter, while the Midwest was the strongest region. 
Our first quarter operating margin grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. As we enter the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year, while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventory. 
Average in-store inventories at the end of the first quarter were down slightly versus last year. The growth in total inventory reflects our ability to take advantage of increased postop availability, a portion of which is from the ongoing West Coast port disruption. 
In addition, we increased inbound in transit inventory to mitigate longer lead times from this situation. 
Let's turn now to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 32 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the first quarter. 
For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations.  As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Let's start with our first quarter the results. Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transaction and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, first quarter operating margins",570,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our first quarter the results. Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transaction and an increase in the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara noted, first quarter operating margins grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. Cost of goods sold improved by 80 basis points, driven primarily by a 60 basis-point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a 5 basis points of leverage on occupancy. 
In addition, distribution center costs were lower by 25 basis points due to the previously mentioned favorable timing of packaway-related costs. These improvements were partially offset by a 10 basis-point increase in freight costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by about 25 basis points during the period mainly from leverage on 5% same-store sales increase. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. 
As planned, we expect to buyback a total of $700 million in stock for the year under this new 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 1, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 2% to 3% with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.24, up from $1.14 in the prior year period. 
Adjusting for our recently announced two-for-one stock split that becomes effective June 11, 2015, second quarter 2015 EPS is forecasted to be $0.59 to $0.62, up from $0.57 in the prior year period. 
The operating statement assumption for this year's second quarter are as follows: Total sales are projected to grow 6% to 7% and comparable store sales increase of 2% to 3%. We are planning to add 18 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. 
Operating margin is projected to be 13.6% to 13.8% versus 14.3% in the prior year. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 20 basis points from the favorable resolution of an outstanding legal matters. 
We are forecasting a slight increase in merchandise margins for this year's second quarter that is expected to be more than offset by higher costs from recent infrastructure investments, including the opening of a new distribution center in California during the quarter. 
In addition, we expect some deleveraging on expenses from higher wage costs. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be $2 million. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding before the effect of our recently announced two-for-one stock split to be about 205 million or 410 million post-split. 
Moving to our outlook for the full year. As mentioned in today's press release, based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.87 compared to our initial guidance of $4.60 to $4.80. 
On a split-adjusted basis, earnings per share are forecasted to be $2.36 to $2.44, up 7% to 10% from $2.21 in fiscal 2014. 
Lastly, we will be making competitive wage adjustments beginning in the second quarter that are included in both our second quarter and updated annual earnings guidance. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

You see that and you get a sense of that in the recent results that have been announced other retailers. Actually, that leads into a second concern, which is those results themselves may cause the environment to become more promotional over the next few months. And then the third reason for conservatism is we're up against our own tough multi-year comparisons. Now to those of you who followed us for some time will know that this is great from our playbook. In an uncertain environment, it makes sense for us to manage business conservatively. If the markets promote weaker promotional, we can protect earnings and if sales trended there, we can chase the business."

And certainly, when we think talk about our earnings guidance next February, my guess, it will be part of that discussion too. But I should say that, although we're expecting wage rate pressure, two things. First of all, we're pretty confident that over time we'll be able to find efficiencies in our business to offset some of those cost increases. And secondly, there is a silver lining here in that the customer has more money in their pockets because of higher wage rates, that would help our topline as well."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2015 performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our better-than-expected first quarter sales and earnings. Our results continue to benefit from value-focused customers responding favorably to our fresh and exciting assortments of name brand bargains.
Earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.37, up $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $282 million compared to $244 million for the same period last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.04 per share mainly from the favorable timing of packaway-related costs that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. Adjusting for this expense timing, first quarter 2015 earnings per share rose 16% over the prior year period. Sales rose 10% for the quarter to $2,938,000,000 with comparable store sales up 5% over the prior year.
Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter as customers continue to respond positively to their value offering.
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the first quarter were relatively broad based. Juniors continues to be the best-performing category during the quarter, while the Midwest was the strongest region.
Our first quarter operating margin grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. As we entered the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year, while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventory. Average in-store inventories at the end of the first quarter were down slightly versus last year. The growth in total inventory reflects our ability to take advantage of increased closeout availability, a portion of which is from the ongoing West Coast port disruption. In addition, we increased inbound in-transit inventory to mitigate longer lead times from this situation.
Let's turn now to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 32 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the first quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transactions and an increase in the size of the average basket.  As Barbara noted, first quarter operating margins grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. Cost of goods sold improved by 80 basis points driven primarily by a 60-basis-point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a 5 basis points of leverage on occupancy. In addition, distribution center costs were lower by 25 basis points due to the previously mentioned favorable timing of packaway-related costs. These improvements were partially offset by a 10-basis-point increase in freight costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by about 25 basis points during the period mainly from leverage on the 5% same-store sales increase.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under this new 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 1, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 2% to 3% with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.24, up from $1.14 in the prior year period. Adjusting for our recently announced 2-for-1 stock split that becomes effective June 11, 2015, second quarter 2015 EPS is forecast to be $0.59 to $0.62, up from $0.57 in the prior year period.
The operating statement assumptions for this year's second quarter are as follows: Total sales are projected to grow 6% to 7% on a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 3%. We are planning to add 18 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be 13.6% to 13.8% versus 14.3% in the prior year. As a reminder, the second quarter last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 20 basis points from the favorable resolution of an outstanding legal matter. We are forecasting a slight increase in merchandise margins for this year's second quarter that is expected to be more than offset by higher costs from recent infrastructure investments, including the opening of a new distribution center in California during the quarter. In addition, we expect some deleveraging on expenses from higher wage costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be $2 million. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding before the effect of our recently announced 2-for-1 stock split to be about 205 million or 410 million post split.
Moving to our outlook for the full year. As mentioned in today's press release, based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.87 compared to our initial guidance of $4.60 to $4.80. On a split-adjusted basis, earnings per share are forecasted to be $2.36 to $2.44, up 7% to 10% from $2.21 in fiscal 2014. Lastly, we will be making competitive wage adjustments beginning in the second quarter that are included in both our second quarter and updated annual earnings guidance.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Actually, that feeds into a second concern, which is those results themselves may cause the environment to become more promotional over the next few months. And then the third reason for conservatism is that we're up against our own tough multi-year comparisons. Now those of you who'd followed us for some time will know that this is straight from our playbook. In an uncertain environment, it makes sense for us to manage the business conservatively.

At this point, dd's has very similar four-walled economics to Ross. So we -- as we look out over the longer term, we're very confident with the dd's business model. We've opened -- well, we opened just over 20 stores, dd's stores in 2014.

As we roll out dd's a little more aggressively and enter markets, the average volumes are probably in the 60s. You do that math. You get in-store returns in the mid-teens. You get a cash-on-cash return of right around the 2 year."

But I should say that although we're expecting wage rate pressure, 2 things: First of all, we're pretty confident that, over time, we'll be able to find efficiencies in our business to offset some of those cost increases; and secondly, there is a silver lining here in that the customer has more money in their pocket because of higher wage rates.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2015 performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our better-than-expected first quarter sales and earnings. Our results continue to benefit from value-focused customers responding favorably to our fresh and exciting assortments of name brand bargains.
Earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.37, up from $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $282 million compared to $244 million for the same period last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.04 per share mainly from the favorable timing of packaway-related costs that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. Adjusting for this expense timing, first quarter 2015 earnings per share rose 16% over the prior year period. Sales rose 10% for the quarter to $2,938,000,000 with comparable store sales up 5% over the prior year.
Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter as customers continued to respond positively to their value offering.
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the first quarter were relatively broad based. Juniors continues to be the best-performing category during the quarter, while the Midwest was the strongest region.
Our first quarter operating margin grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year, while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventory. Average in-store inventories at the end of the first quarter were down slightly versus last year. The growth in total inventory reflects our ability to take advantage of increased closeout availability, a portion of which is from the ongoing West Coast port disruption. In addition, we increased inbound in-transit inventory to mitigate longer lead times from this situation.
Let's turn now to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 32 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the first quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

As Barbara noted, first quarter operating margins gre",571,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our first quarter results. Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher transactions and an increase in the size of the average basket.  As Barbara noted, first quarter operating margins grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. Cost of goods sold improved by 80 basis points driven primarily by a 60-basis-point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a 5 basis points of leverage on occupancy. In addition, distribution center costs were lower by 25 basis points due to the previously mentioned favorable timing of packaway-related costs. These improvements were partially offset by a 10-basis-point increase in freight costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by about 25 basis points during the period mainly from leverage on the 5% same-store sales increase.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under this new 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 1, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 2% to 3% with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.24, up from $1.14 in the prior year period. Adjusting for our recently announced 2-for-1 stock split that becomes effective June 11, 2015, second quarter 2015 EPS is forecast to be $0.59 to $0.62, up from $0.57 in the prior year period.
The operating statement assumptions for this year's second quarter are as follows: total sales are projected to grow 6% to 7% on a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 3%. We are planning to add 18 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be 13.6% to 13.8% versus 14.3% in the prior year. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 20 basis points from the favorable resolution of an outstanding legal matter. We are forecasting a slight increase in merchandise margins for this year's second quarter that is expected to be more than offset by higher costs from recent infrastructure investments, including the opening of a new distribution center in California during the quarter. In addition, we expect some deleveraging on expenses from higher wage costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be $2 million. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding before the effect of our recently announced 2-for-1 stock split to be about 205 million or 410 million post split.
Moving to our outlook for the full year. As mentioned in today's press release, based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.87 compared to our initial guidance of $4.60 to $4.80. On a split-adjusted basis, earnings per share are forecasted to be $2.36 to $2.44, up 7% to 10% from $2.21 in fiscal 2014. Lastly, we will be making competitive wage adjustments beginning in the second quarter that are included in both our second quarter and updated annual earnings guidance.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Yes, we've been very pleased with our performance over the last few quarters, but there are a few reasons to be a little bit conservative as we look forward. Firstly, we think the macroeconomic and retail outlook remains pretty uncertain. You see that, and you get a sense of that in the recent results that have been announced by other retailers. Actually, that feeds into a second concern, which is those results themselves may cause the environment to become more promotional over the next few months. And then the third reason for conservatism is that we're up against our own tough multi-year comparisons. Now those of you who'd followed us for some time will know that this is straight from our playbook. In an uncertain environment, it makes sense for us to manage the business conservatively. If the markets promote -- sorry, weak or promotional, we can protect earnings, and if sales trend is there, we can chase the business."

The first is higher packaway inventory as we were able to take advantage of the increased closeout availability. A portion of that was related to the port disruption. That piece was harder to predict, and we take advantage of what the market gives us. And in terms of the other piece, which is the inbound in-transit levels, that was our efforts to mitigate the longer port lead times, and we planned to do that as we will continue to watch the port. There's still longer lead times, and we'll continue to mitigate that with higher in-transit levels. And higher in-transit levels, thus, means we're putting stuff, imports on the water earlier or trying to ship around the West Coast port."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As a reminder, all earnings per share results and forecasts for both the current and prior year reflect our recent 2-for-1 stock split that became effective June 11, 2015.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings growth for both the second quarter and first 6 months. These results reflect that our assortments of compelling name-brand bargains continue to resonate with today's value-focused customers.
Earnings per share for the second quarter increased 11% to $0.63, up from $0.57 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $259 million compared to $240 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 9% for the quarter to $2,968,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% over the prior year.
While second quarter operating margin of 13.9% was down from last year, it was slightly better than expected. The quarter benefited from higher merchandise margin and tight expense control that partially offset a planned increase in distribution costs related to recent infrastructure investment.
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.32, up from $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings were $541 million, up 12% from $583 million (sic) [$483 million] last year. Sales for the year-to-date period rose 9% to $5,906,000,000, and comparable store sales increased 5%.
Similar to Ross, dd's posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date period, as customers also responded positively to their value offering. The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the second quarter were relatively broad-based. Juniors and Home were the best-performing departments, while the Midwest continue to be the strongest region. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of total inventory compared to 43% last year. Average in-store inventories at quarter-end were down slightly versus last year, while total inventories were higher as we have taken advantage of increased post-ads availability in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 19 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the second quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or relocate a handful of stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

And let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven mainly by an increase in the size of the average basket with the number of transactions up slightly from last year.
As mentioned earlier, while second quarter operating margin of 13.9% declined 35 basis points from last year, it was better than expected. Cost of goods sold increased 20 basis points, mainly from a 40 basis point increase in distribution expenses that were impacted by the opening of the new distribution center during the second quarter. Freight and buying costs also increased 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy leverage of 10 basis points.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points. Last year second quarter included a onetime benefit of about 20 basis points from the resolution of a legal matter. This prior year comparison more than offset the expense leverage we realized from the 4% comparable store sales increase.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 31, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.50, up from $0.46 in the 2014 third quarter.
For the fourth quarter ending January 30, 2016, we are planning same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a 6% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year.
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of up 1% to 2%. We're planning to add 19 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be 11.3% to 11.5% versus 11.8% in the prior year. We are forecasting merchandise margins for this year's third quarter to be relatively flat, while distribution costs are expected to remain elevated over the prior year. The higher distribution costs reflect the recent infrastructure investments and unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 35%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 406 million.
Based on our results for the first 6 months and second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45, up 9% to 11% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

To maximize our results, we will continue to dedicate our resources to address our top priority: offering customers the best possible on a wide assortment of fresh and exciting name-brand fashion for the family and the home.

In terms of the guidance, the 1 to 2 in the back half versus the 2 to 3, we've been very pleased with our performance the last couple of quarters, but there are a couple of reasons to be conservative in our guidance. There's ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment, and you guys have a sense of that in some of the recent retailers' results, particularly from some of the department stores. And the second reason to be conservative is we're up against some pretty tough multiyear comparisons in the back half. Last year's third quarter was a full comp. Last year's fourth [ph] quarter was a 6 [ph] comp, so were going up against a number. So putting that aside, you and others who followed us for a while will know that this is sort of a -- this is very much from our playbook.

In terms of longer term, yes, we're very confident in the dd's' business model. Last year, we opened about 20 dd's stores and on track to do about the same. So we're pretty happy with that business."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As a reminder, all earnings per share results and forecasts for both the current and prior year reflect our recent 2-for-1 stock split that became effective June 11, 2015.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings growth for both the second quarter and first 6 months. These results reflect that our assortments of compelling name-brand bargains continue to resonate with today's value-focused customers.
Earnings per share for the second quarter increased 11% to $0.63, up from $0.57 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $259 million compared to $240 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 9% for the quarter to $2,968,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% over the prior year.
While second quarter operating margin of 13.9% was down from last year, it was slightly better than expected. The quarter benefited from higher merchandise margin and tight expense control that partially offset a planned increase in distribution costs related to recent infrastructure investment.
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.32, up from $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings were $541 million, up 12% from $583 million (sic) [ $483 million ] last year. Sales for the year-to-date period rose 9% to $5,906,000,000 and comparable store sales increased 5%.
Similar to Ross, dd's posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date period as customers also responded positively to their value offering. 
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the second quarter were relatively broad-based. Juniors and Home were the best-performing departments while the Midwest continued to be the strongest region. 
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of total inventory compared to 43% last year. Average in-store inventories at quarter end were down slightly versus last year while total inventories were higher as we have taken advantage of increased closeout availability in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 19 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the second quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNT locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or relocate a handful of stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven mainly by an increase in the size of the average basket with the number of transactions up slightly from last year. As mentioned earlier, while second quarter operating margin of 13.9% declined 35 basis points from last year, it was better than expected. 
Cost of goods sold increased 20 basis points, mainly from a 40 basis point increase in distribution expenses that were impacted by the opening of a new distribution center during the second quarter. Freight and buying costs also increased 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy leverage of 10 basis points.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points. Last year's second quarter included a onetime benefit of about 20 basis points from the resolution of a legal matter. This prior year comparison more than offset the expense leverage we realized from the 4% comparable store sales increase.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 31, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.50, up from $0.46 in the 2014 third quarter.
For the fourth quarter ending January 30, 2016, we are planning same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a 6% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year.
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of up 1% to 2%. We're planning to add 19 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be 11.3% to 11.5% versus 11.8% in the prior year. We are forecasting merchandise margins for this year's third quarter to be relatively flat while distribution costs are expected to remain elevated over the prior year. The higher distribution costs reflect the recent infrastructure investments and unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. 
Our tax rate is planned at approximately 35%. 
And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 406 million.
Based on our results for the first 6 months and second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45, up 9% to 11% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

In terms of the guidance, the 1% to 2% in the back half versus the 2% to 3%, we've been very pleased with our performance the last couple of quarters, but there are a couple of reasons to be conservative in our guidance. There's ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment and you get a sense of that in some of the recent retailers' results, particularly from some of the department stores. And then the second reason to be conservative is we're up against some pretty tough multiyear comparisons in the back half. Last year's third quarter was a 4% comp, last year's fourth quarter was a 6% comp so we're going up against those numbers. So putting all that to the side, you and others who followed us for a while will know that this is sort of a -- this is very much from our playbook.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As a reminder, all earnings per share results and forecasts for both the current and prior year reflect our recent 2-for-1 stock split that became effective June 11, 2015.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings growth for both the second quarter and first 6 months. These results reflect that our assortments of compelling name-brand bargains continue to resonate with today's value-focused customers.
Earnings per share for the second quarter increased 11% to $0.63, up from $0.57 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $259 million compared to $240 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 9% for the quarter to $2,968,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% over the prior year.
While second quarter operating margin of 13.9% was down from last year, it was slightly better than expected. The quarter benefited from higher merchandise margin and tight expense control that partially offset a planned increase in distribution costs related to recent infrastructure investment.
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.32, up from $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings were $541 million, up 12% from $583 million (sic) [ $483 million ] last year. Sales for the year-to-date period rose 9% to $5,906,000,000 and comparable store sales increased 5%.
Similar to Ross, dd's posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date period as customers also responded positively to their value offering. 
The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the second quarter were relatively broad-based. Juniors and Home were the best-performing departments while the Midwest continued to be the strongest region. 
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of total inventory compared to 43% last year. Average in-store inventories at quarter end were down slightly versus last year while total inventories were higher as we have taken advantage of increased closeout availability in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 19 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the second quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNT locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or relocate a handful of stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

As mentioned earlier, wh",540,"Thank you, Barbara, and let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven mainly by an increase in the size of the average basket with the number of transactions up slightly from last year. As mentioned earlier, while second quarter operating margin of 13.9% declined 35 basis points from last year, it was better than expected. 
Cost of goods sold increased 20 basis points, mainly from a 40 basis point increase in distribution expenses that were impacted by the opening of a new distribution center during the second quarter. Freight and buying costs also increased 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy leverage of 10 basis points.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points. Last year's second quarter included a onetime benefit of about 20 basis points from the resolution of a legal matter. This prior year comparison more than offset the expense leverage we realized from the 4% comparable store sales increase.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February 2015.
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 31, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.50, up from $0.46 in the 2014 third quarter.
For the fourth quarter ending January 30, 2016, we are planning same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a 6% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year.
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of up 1% to 2%. We're planning to add 19 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be 11.3% to 11.5% versus 11.8% in the prior year. We are forecasting merchandise margins for this year's third quarter to be relatively flat while distribution costs are expected to remain elevated over the prior year. The higher distribution costs reflect the recent infrastructure investments and unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. 
Our tax rate is planned at approximately 35%. 
And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 406 million.
Based on our results for the first 6 months and second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45, up 9% to 11% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

In terms of the guidance, the 1% to 2% in the back half versus the 2% to 3%, we've been very pleased with our performance the last couple of quarters, but there are a couple of reasons to be conservative in our guidance. There's ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment and you get a sense of that in some of the recent retailers' results, particularly from some of the department stores. And then the second reason to be conservative is we're up against some pretty tough multiyear comparisons in the back half. Last year's third quarter was a 4% comp, last year's fourth quarter was a 6% comp so we're going up against those numbers. So putting all that to the side, you and others who followed us for a while will know that this is sort of a -- this is very much from our playbook.

We will begin our call today would ever be of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter. After which, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected sales and earnings growth we achieved in the third quarter. These results demonstrate that customers continue to respond positively to the wide assortment of fresh and exciting bargains we offer throughout our stores. 
Earnings per share for the third quarter grew 15% to $0.53 on net earnings that rose 12% to $216 million. Sales increased 7% to $2,783,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% on top of last year's 4% gain. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share grew 15% to $1.85, while net earnings rose 12% to $757 million. 
Year-to-date sales increased 8% to $8,689,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4%. dd's also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date period. 
Men's was the strongest category at Ross Store in the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region. 
Third quarter operating margin increased 30 basis points to 12.1%. These results were above plan and primarily driven by higher merchandise margins. 
As we ended the quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 14% over the prior year with packaway levels at 48% of total inventories compared to 42% last year. 
Average in-store inventories at quarter end were down approximately 1% versus last year. 
As planned, we completed our 2015 store opening program during the third quarter with the addition of 19 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS location for grand total of 84 new stores this year net of closures. 
We expect to end fiscal 2015 with 1,274 Ross and 172 dd's DISCOUNTS stores. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the year."

Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, rising 30 basis points from last year to 12.1%. 
Cost of goods sold declined 45 basis points, driven by a 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and a 5 basis point improvement each in freight and volume costs. This was partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to recent infrastructure investments that were partially offset by the favorable timing of packaway-related costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points due in part to higher wages. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million. 
We remain on track to repurchase a total of $700 million in common stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter guidance, which remains unchanged from what we communicated in August. 
For the 13 weeks ending January 30, 2016, we continue to expect same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a strong 6% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year. 
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are forecasted to grow 4% to 5% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of flat to up 1%. 
If sales perform in line with this guidance, operating margin is projected to be 12.6% to 12.8% versus 13.1% in the prior year. 
The forecasted decline versus last year is mainly due to our expectation for higher distribution expenses from recent infrastructure investments and the timing of packaway-related costs. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 403 million. 
Based on this guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.48, up 11% to 12% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

As we enter the fourth quarter, we are pleased with our fresh and exciting assortments of name, brand, bargains and gifts for this holiday season. 
Despite outperforming our sales and earnings target throughout 2015, there are a number of factors that still caused us to be cautious on forecasting for the fourth quarter. 
First, we're up against our toughest sales comparison of the year. As Michael mentioned, comparable store sales in last year's fourth quarter were up a robust 6%.  Second, there is ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment; and third, based on the current retail landscape, we expect the upcoming holiday season to be highly promotional. 
As a result, while we always hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a conservative posture. 
Over the longer term, we remain confident about our prospects for respectable sales and earnings growth. This is based on 2 key factors: Our belief that off price will remain a strong performing segment especially given consumers' ongoing focus on value; and our own proven ability to offer our customers compelling bargains on an everyday basis.  This is and always will be the key to success in our business.

We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter. After which, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected sales and earnings growth we achieved in the third quarter. These results demonstrate that customers continue to respond positively to the wide assortments of fresh and exciting bargains we offer throughout our stores.
Earnings per share for the third quarter grew 15% to $0.53. Our net earnings that rose 12% to $216 million. Sales increased 7% to $2,783,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% on top of last year's 4% gain.
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share grew 15% to $1.85, while net earnings rose 12% to $757 million.
Year-to-date sales increased 8% to $8,689,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4%. dd's also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date periods.
Men's was the strongest category at Ross during the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region.
Third quarter operating margin increased 30 basis points to 12.1%. These results were above plan and primarily driven by higher merchandise margins.
As we ended the quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 14% over the prior year with packaway levels at 48% of total inventories compared to 42% last year.
Average in-store inventories at quarter-end were down approximately 1% versus last year.
As planned, we completed our 2015 store opening program during the third quarter with the addition of 19 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for grand total of 84 new stores this year net of closures.
We expect to end fiscal 2015 with 1,274 Ross and 172 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket.
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, rising 30 basis points from last year to 12.1%.
Cost of goods sold declined 45 basis points, driven by a 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and a 5 basis point improvement each in freight and buying costs. This was partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to recent infrastructure investments that were partially offset by the favorable timing of packaway-related costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points due in part to higher wages.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million.
We remain on track to repurchase a total of $700 million in common stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year.
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter guidance, which remains unchanged from what we communicated in August.
For the 13 weeks ending January 30, 2016, we continue to expect same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a strong 6% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year.
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are forecasted to grow 4% to 5% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of flat to up 1%.  If sales perform in line with this guidance, operating margin is projected to be 12.6% to 12.8% versus 13.1% in the prior year.
The forecasted decline versus last year is mainly due to our expectation for higher distribution expenses from recent infrastructure investments and the timing of packaway-related costs.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 403 million.
Based on this guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.48, up 11% to 12% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

As we enter the fourth quarter, we are pleased with our fresh and exciting assortments of name, brand, bargains and gifts for this holiday season.
Despite outperforming our sales and earnings target throughout 2015, there are a number of factors that still cause us to be cautious on forecasting the fourth quarter.
First, we're up against our toughest sales comparison of the year. As Michael mentioned, comparable store sales in last year's fourth quarter were up a robust 6%; second, there is ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment; and third, based on the current retail landscape, we expect the upcoming holiday season to be highly promotional.
As a result, while we always hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a conservative posture.
Over the longer term, we remain confident about our prospects for respectable sales and earnings growth. This is based on 2 key factors: Our belief that off-price will remain a strong performing segment especially given consumers' ongoing focus on value; and our own proven ability to offer our customers compelling bargains on an everyday basis.  This is and always will be the key to success in our business.
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

And I would say as look at this fourth quarter, the fact that we're up against the 6% comp. So all of those things kind of go into the mix for us to come up with the guidance for the fourth quarter. So I think I probably answer your first question. I don't think I really understand your second question about inventories. Could you just repeat that?"

We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected sales and earnings growth we achieved in the third quarter. These results demonstrate that customers continue to respond positively to the wide assortments of fresh and exciting bargains we offer throughout our stores.
Earnings per share for the third quarter grew 15% to $0.53. Our net earnings that rose 12% to $216 million. Sales increased 7% to $2,783,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% on top of last year's 4% gain.
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share grew 15% to $1.85, while net earnings rose 12% to $757 million.
Year-to-date sales increased 8% to $8,689,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4%. dd's also posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date periods.
Men's was the strongest category at Ross during the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region.
Third quarter operating margin increased 30 basis points to 12.1%. These results were above plan and primarily driven by higher merchandise margins.
As we ended the quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 14% over the prior year with packaway levels at 48% of total inventories compared to 42% last year.
Average in-store inventories at quarter-end were down approximately 1% versus last year.
As planned, we completed our 2015 store opening program during the third quarter with the addition of 19 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a grand total of 84 new stores this year net of closures.
We expect to end fiscal 2015 with 1,274 Ross and 172 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket.
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, rising 30 basis points from last year to 12.1%.
Cost of goods sold declined 45 basis points, driven by a 45 basis point increase in merchandise margins and a 5 basis point improvement each in freight and buying costs. This was partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to recent infrastructure investments that were partially offset by the favorable timing of packaway-related costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points due in part to higher wages.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million.
We remain on track to repurchase a total of $700 million in common stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year.
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter guidance, which remains unchanged from what we communicated in August.
For the 13 weeks ending January 30, 2016, we continue to expect same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a strong 6% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year.
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are forecasted to grow 4% to 5% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of flat to up 1%.  If sales perform in line with this guidance, operating margin is projected to be 12.6% to 12.8% versus 13.1% in the prior year.
The forecasted decline versus last year is mainly due to our expectation for higher distribution expenses from recent infrastructure investments and the timing of packaway-related costs.
Net interest expense is estimated to be about $5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 403 million.
Based on this guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.48, up 11% to 12% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

As we enter the fourth quarter, we are pleased with our fresh and exciting assortments of name, brand, bargains and gifts for this holiday season.
Despite outperforming our sales and earnings target throughout 2015, there are a number of factors that still cause us to be cautious on forecasting the fourth quarter.
First, we're up against our toughest sales comparison of the year. As Michael mentioned, comparable store sales in last year's fourth quarter were up a robust 6%; second, there is ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment; and third, based on the current retail landscape, we expect the upcoming holiday season to be highly promotional.
As a result, while we always hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a conservative posture.
Over the longer term, we remain confident about our prospects for respectable sales and earnings growth. This is based on 2 key factors: Our belief that off-price will remain a strong performing segment especially given consumers' ongoing focus on value; and our own proven ability to offer our customers compelling bargains on an everyday basis.  This is and always will be the key to success in our business.
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

In terms of additional new markets, I mean, the Midwest is, I think you will appreciate, it's a pretty big area and there are a lots of individual markets within the Midwest. So our focus right now and probably for the next few years is going to be to build out our presence in those markets."

The first one is, during the quarter, the environment in terms of the promotional level of activity from the competition, did you see any changes then as the quarter progressed? And I guess, you didn't really change at all the fourth quarter prospects in terms of your guidance or your plans. So my question is, has the environment at all given you the thoughts around changing it in terms of the pricing umbrella from department stores probably being a little bit more promotional as you think about your prospects for the fourth quarter?"

And I think as Barbara had outlined in her remarks, we think it makes sense to be relatively conservative in the fourth quarter with the ongoing economic uncertainty. Secondly, the environment looks like it will be fairly promotional. Some of that is based upon just what we're seeing in terms of the recent reports in department stores. Those reports we have to think this could be a very promotional fourth quarter. And then the final point, but perhaps most important is that we're up against the 6% comp. Last fourth quarter, we reported really the terrific 6% comps. So we're up against that number. The other point I'd make is in our business, we typically plan our business relatively conservatively. That's kind of -- probably the first bullet point in our playlist. We plan the business conservatively, and then we know we can chase the business if the sales are there. So I think, we think it's best to plan conservatively, but then hope to do better."

Say they know when they put it in there, that there has to be a variance to what's going on in the world. All that being said, if there was something in packaway that we didn't think was the right value during our processes, we would capture that. And there's a lot of size, a lot of size around packaway and what's in there, we would put it out, and we would mark it down and we would move on.
