Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to introduce Eric Norris and Tom Schneeberger, both named to their positions recently. Each has held leadership positions across multiple businesses within FMC and bring a wealth of experience to these roles. We are confident even their successful track record that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter.
In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in the sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventories in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton.
Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture.
Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally, and I'm glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicide that address wheat resistance issue in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn focused quarter. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA perspective planting report is issued later this month. 
Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions.  
Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid with stable acreage in oilseed rate and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter.
In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia and especially in India driving increased pharmacy growth experience volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft.
Market conditions for lithium products were weak. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014 with a decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other application is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage application continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has lead to a tightening in some segments and created for more favorable pricing environment, especially for Lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing.
Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefits from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further.
Today, as we review that segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance.
With that, I will now turn to segment results. Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil. Specifically, delete planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. 
In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sale in low-margin, third-party product contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybean, as the need for residual herbicide, such as our authority brands, continue to expand.
In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. 
As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold higher volume of 3 emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new key ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of the platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. 
As we look at the market for 2015, current data, such as the growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to derisk their field. As current rent prices and with stocking use at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag end markets are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015.
Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, separate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies.
Now looking at the 2015 at market by region. In Brazil, drier than normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. The ease elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work to excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, total area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat.
Weather conditions for sugarcane was better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the company environment remained high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics serving as a potential demand steals. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. 
Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels.
Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Wheat resistance remains a growing concern both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. As in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking this together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits.
In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed reap markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and lead to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014.
In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. The rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC.
First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than one month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances.
For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year with higher herbicide demand, offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until 7 [ph] quarter. As a result, we expect the challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment.
For the full year, continued spread of wheat resistance in North America and Latin America and market share gains in Asia and EMEA will offset pricing pressures and provide training growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014.
Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1% and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid, specifically demand for brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, a market that support generic tablets production for Western use.
Similar to last quarter, our Nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the real mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends while demand for nutrition called products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high concentration application
In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. 
Additionally, a part of this program, we have decided to delay the current MCC plant's opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to a time plant provides greater, long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plan at our Investor Day and throughout the year.
For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India, and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid single-digit percent over 2014.
First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and lead to an unplanned outage of alternate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of quarter MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. And now let me review Minerals.
Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4% and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Recalled production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the fourth quarter of 2013.
In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable spread and logistic adjustment and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability.
In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide largely used in electric vehicle batteries was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low teens percent in 2014.
However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina as we're enable to counteract increasing cost trends.
In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce costs as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate.
Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all recorded regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be promptly and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November, and we're extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. I'll now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

We finished the year with cash from operations before all separation and M&A-related spending of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discont",1195,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with the review of cash flow. We finished the year with cash from operations before all separation and M&A-related spending of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow before the separation and M&A-related spending was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million.
After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less of that in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American ag solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand.
Despite this Agricultural Solutions business and Brazil in particular remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil than recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015.
And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow and CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within a range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees.
A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high tax countries of the U.S. in Brazil than forecast, as well as of the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December.
The full year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full resolution of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules.
In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the highest foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015.
And I'm moving on to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. In 2014, the net impact of foreign currency movements on our reported EBIT was approximately $20 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This consisted of a mix of transaction, translation and hedging cost impacts. Agricultural Solutions carried most of these costs in its segment results. The largest countries we your exposure to the euro, the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi, followed by the Argentine peso and various Asian currencies. And we expect most of these to continue to exhibit greater volatility relative to the dollar in 2015.
In 2015, the impact of the strengthening dollar will be mixed for FMC, but the most basic level sales we make in currencies to devalue will be lower in U.S. dollar terms, putting pressure on sales growth when reported in U.S. dollars. This is especially the case in our Health and Nutrition and Cheminova businesses, given their relatively large euro exposures.
However, we also have a significant cost base in Europe, meaning, the impact on our earnings will be far more limited than the impact on revenue. Equally important, we expect those products we manufacture in Europe for export to the U.S. will have a lower cost in U.S. dollar terms.
In Brazil, a devaluing reais is generally positive to our business, although there's no doubt it is likely to influence some of the dynamics of our operations there. We price and invoice largely in U.S. dollars and our customers receive the vast majority of their revenues in U.S. dollars. However, growth is typically incur half or more of their total expenses in reais. This clearly proves the profitability of growers in reais teams partially shielding them from the depreciation in global agricultural crop prices and creating an incentive to incur more costs locally where possible.
With increased volatility and exchange rates, we expect to see higher cost of hedging in 2015 for all major currencies. Unlike in prior years, we are not providing a formal full year EPS guidance with our earnings today. However, based upon the best judgment we have right now, we expect 2015 earnings to be in the range of $3.50 and $3.90 per share. To place this in the context of 2014 earnings, let me provide a bridge between the 2014 EPS and the midpoint of this range.
First of all, the addition of 10 months of Cheminova earnings, including synergies, growth in the earnings contribution from our current ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses, and the loss of the Alkali earnings, will collectively reduce EPS by $0.10. Increases in corporate costs primarily due to higher expected incentive payments will be a headwind of a further $0.07, and higher interest expense will reduce EPS by $0.06.
Finally, a tax rate higher than the unusually low rate we saw in '14 will reduce EPS by an additional $0.12 per share. This bridge is centered on the mid-point of a range, which itself is much wider than we typically provide. This is largely due to the impact that the timing of the Cheminova close has upon our ability to accurately forecast our Ag business today, especially in respect to the calendarization of Cheminova earnings and the timing synergy realization. 
In addition, the delay in the closing has prevented us from spending time with Cheminova management to understand their latest expectations for 2015, a process that is critical for us to complete before we can provide detailed full year and quarterly guidance.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Agricultural solutions will continue its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiatives. The acquisition of Cheminova enhances our business, provides greater balance to our portfolio, broadens our geographic reach and accelerate our innovation efforts. 
Our Health and Nutrition business continues to demonstrate the strength of our franchise with high-margin and flexible growth. We expect manufacturing excellence programs will deliver additional upside, reinforcing our confidence in the prospect for this business.
In Lithium, underlying demand patterns remain attractive, and market dynamics suggest we will see increased pricing opportunities in the coming years. We will continue to manage our assets in order to maximize returns from the downstream market, where we have a leading position, and we will continue to drive operational excellence as a true to help offset cost inflation in our Argentine operations.
Today, we are demonstrating progress toward a portfolio focused on agricultural, Health and Nutrition end markets. The attractive price we achieved in the Alkali sale will allow us to pay down Cheminova acquisition debt more quickly. And the benefit we will deliver from revenue and cost synergies from Cheminova will ensure our earnings growth outperforms the broad Ag market.
Across all of our businesses, 2015 will be an important year for FMC. Although we recognize that near-term visibility is muted, we remain very excited about our prospect to 2015 and beyond.

In fact, rules forbid us to look at what Cheminova is doing. So we have no visibility how their sales are unfolding within those 3 months. And if they are being in February, they will most likely be lower in March, or they could be already in March and April. So that creates a very large range for us.

So reduction '15 going forward versus '14, there is a few reasons for that. First of all, Alkali tend to be a business, which is slightly more capital intensive than the other businesses. So it will not be part of the portfolio where you know we tend to operate Ag on an asset-light business. So there is a capital intensity, which is different between those 2 business. Also, with the completion of the MCC plant, we have way less capital to spend even if we make it more flexible with the pharmaceutical line than the $100 million we spent over the last 2 years. So you're going to have a -- at this point, they way we look at Health and Nutrition. We have capacity. It's a matter of rationalization and optimization of our footprint, but we have capacity. So you bring together the fact that we have -- we have the capacity that we need in Health and Nutrition, we have an asset-light business model even with the acquisition of Cheminova, and we have less of an intensity with alkali leading the portfolio, that would reduce the capital utilization for the next -- for the years to come. So I would say the number you have in front of us for 2015 is going to be a pretty typical number we're going to be facing for years to come. The reduction versus where we were in term of forecast and where we are today, it's purely controlling capital spending in light of our -- in light of the economical situation in the Ag business. I think we, like any company in that space, when you face a slowdown in the business, you just control your capital. We have so many seeing way less growth in 2015 and '16 in that business than we saw 2 or 3 years ago. So several year reduction in capital spending. So we're just managing very, very carefully the capital over the last 4, 5 months, when it became clear that 2015 would be a challenging year for companies in the Ag world."

There is no people factors, which is coming at play. And it's why the recovery is on the slower side. First, there was all of these issue we've talked about before on putting prices, which have been really decreasing the overall consumption in Asia, China or Indonesia for the peanut, milk or some of the dairy-based product. So it has been, first, a slowdown in the market, which led many of our customers to have too much inventory and not needing to buy from us. That was one aspect, and we believe it was more of the main reason for this now. But there is another market dynamic, which is taking place and enforcing us to look at to adjust our portfolio. It's always the same. It's always a challenge, but it's also an opportunity. What we are seeing is very different type of protein milk now, which are growing in this market following the success of peanut milk. So the usage of MCC, which was for us, we are one of the pioneer in this application with our MCC product line to develop this market with our customers, the success has created now a new product, which are requiring different formulation, different applications for us. So there is an adjustment on the type of product, and we are in the middle of developing the products to participate in the growth of those new beverage. Those new product will also be supplied. They are the same chemistry as the one we have for peanut milk. They will also be supplied from a current plan and in the future, from a plant in Asia. But there is a shift in the market, which could lead to new opportunities and new challenges. So all of that, the shifting elements, are creating a slow recovery for us, but it's not like we are back to a single beverage with inventory of a customers and we are growing back. So it will be complex from a consumer standpoint."

We are confident, given their successful track record, that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. 
Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter.
In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventory in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton.  Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture.  Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally. I'm glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. 
In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicide that address wheat resistance issue in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn-focused products. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA Prospective Planting report is issued later this month. 
Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions.  
Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid with stable acreage in oilseed rape and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter.
In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia and especially in India driving increased pharmaceutical excipients volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft.
Market conditions for Lithium products were weak. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014, with the decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other applications is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage application continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has led to a tightening in some segments and created for more favorable pricing environment, especially for lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing.
Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this later, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefits from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further.
Today, as we review the segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance.
With that, I will now turn to segment results. 
Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil, specifically, delayed planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. 
In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sale in low-margin, third-party product, contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybeans, as the need for residual herbicide, such as our Authority brands, continue to expand.
In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. 
As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly in anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold higher volume of pre-emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new active ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of the platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. 
As we look at the market for 2015, current data suggests that growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to de-risk their field. At current rent prices and with stocking use at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag chem market are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015.
Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, accelerate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies.
Now looking at the 2015 ag market by region. In Brazil, drier-than-normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. These elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work through excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, cotton area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat.
Weather conditions for sugarcane while better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the company's environment remains high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics serving as a potential demand stimulus. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. 
Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year, with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels.
Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Wheat resistance remains a growing concern across both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. And in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking these together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits.
In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed rape markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and led to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014.
In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. Rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. 
Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC.
First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than 1 month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances.
For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year, with higher herbicide demand, offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until second quarter. As a result, we expect a challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment.
For the full year, continued spread of wheat resistance in North America and Latin America, and market share gains in Asia and EMEA will offset pricing pressures and provide earnings growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014.
Now turning to Health and Nutrition. 
Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1%, and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. 
In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid, specifically demand for our resale brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, the market that supports generic tablets production for Western use.
Similar to last quarter, our nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the original mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends, while demand for nutraceutical products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high concentration application
In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that we expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. 
Additionally, as part of this program, we have decided to delay the Thailand MCC plant opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to our Thailand plant provides greater long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plan at our Investor Day and throughout the year.
For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India; and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid single-digit percent over 2014.
First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and led to an unplanned outage of alginate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of colloidal MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. 
And now, let me review Minerals.
Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4% and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Record production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the first -- fourth quarter of 2013.
In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous-year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable spread and logistic adjustments, and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability.
In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous-year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide largely used in electric vehicle batteries was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low-teens percent in 2014.
However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina as we're unable to counteract increasing cost trends.
In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be a significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce cost as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate.
Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all recorded regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be promptly and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. 
We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November, and we're extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."
28606,280246979,755796,"FMC Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on disco",1193,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. 
We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow, before the separation and M&A-related spending, was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million.
After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less than in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American Ag Solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand.
Despite this Agricultural Solutions business and Brazil in particular, remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil in recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015.
And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow and CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within the range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees.
A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings, with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high-tax countries of the U.S. and Brazil than forecast, as well as the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December.
The full-year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full-year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full reconciliation of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules.
In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the highest foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015.
Now moving on to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. 
In 2014, the net impact of foreign currency movements on our reported EBIT was approximately $20 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. This consisted of a mix of transaction, translation and hedging cost impacts. Agricultural Solutions carried most of these costs in its segment results. The largest currencies which we carry exposure to are the euro, the Brazilian reais, the Chinese renminbi, followed by the Argentine peso and various Asian currencies. And we expect most of these to continue to exhibit greater volatility relative to the dollar in 2015.
In 2015, the impact of the strengthening dollar will be mixed for FMC. At the most basic level, sales we make in currencies, the devalue will be lower in U.S. dollar terms, putting pressure on sales growth when reported in U.S. dollars. This is especially the case in our Health and Nutrition and Cheminova businesses, given their relatively large euro exposures.
However, we also have a significant cost base in Europe, meaning, the impact on our earnings will be far more limited than the impact on revenue. Equally important, we expect those products we manufacture in Europe for export to the U.S. will have a lower cost in U.S. dollar terms.
In Brazil, a devaluing reais is generally a positive to our business, although there is no doubt it is likely to influence some of the dynamics of our operations there. We price and invoice largely in U.S. dollars and our customers receive the vast majority of their revenues in U.S. dollars. However, growers typically incur half or more of their total expenses in reais. This clearly improves the profitability of growers in reais terms, partially shielding them from the depreciation in global agricultural crop prices and creating an incentive to incur more costs locally, where possible.
With increased volatility and exchange rates, we expect to see higher cost of hedging in 2015 for all major currencies. Unlike in prior years, we are not providing a formal full-year EPS guidance with our earnings today. However, based upon the best judgment we have right now, we expect 2015 earnings to be in the range of $3.50 and $3.90 per share. To place this in the context of 2014 earnings, let me provide a bridge between the 2014 EPS and the midpoint of this range.
First of all, the addition of 10 months of Cheminova earnings, including synergies; growth in the earnings contribution from our current ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses; and the loss of the Alkali earnings, will collectively reduce EPS by $0.10. Increases in corporate costs, primarily due to higher expected incentive payments, will be a headwind of a further $0.07; and higher interest expense will reduce EPS by $0.06.
Finally, a tax rate higher than the unusually low rate we saw in '14 will reduce EPS by an additional $0.12 per share. This bridge is centered on the mid-point of a range, which itself is much wider than we would typically provide. This is largely due to the impact that the timing of the Cheminova close has upon our ability to accurately forecast our Ag business today, especially in respect to the calendarization of Cheminova earnings and the timing of synergy realization. 
In addition, the delay in the closing has prevented us from spending time with Cheminova management to understand their latest expectations for 2015, a process that is critical for us to complete before we can provide detailed full year and quarterly guidance.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Agricultural solutions will continue its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiatives. The acquisition of Cheminova enhances our business, provides greater balance to our portfolio, broadens our geographic reach and accelerates our innovation efforts. 
Our Health and Nutrition business continues to demonstrate the strength of our franchise with high-margin and flexible growth. We expect our manufacturing excellence programs will deliver additional upside, reinforcing our confidence in the prospect for this business.
In Lithium, underlying demand patterns remain attractive and market dynamics suggest we will see increased pricing opportunities in the coming years. We will continue to manage our assets in order to maximize returns from the downstream market, where we have a leading position, and we will continue to drive operational excellence as a tool to help offset cost inflation in our Argentina operations.
Today, we are demonstrating progress toward a portfolio focused on agricultural, health and nutrition end markets. The attractive price we achieved in the Alkali sale will allow us to pay down Cheminova acquisition debt more quickly. And the benefits we will deliver from revenue and cost synergies from Cheminova will ensure our earnings growth outperforms the broad ag market.
Across all of our businesses, 2015 will be an important year for FMC. Although we recognize that near-term visibility is muted, we remain very excited about our prospect through 2015 and beyond.
I look forward to seeing you in April to provide more detail on the plans that we are putting in place and to provide more guidance on both near-term performance and the long-range vision we have for FMC.

And what we mean by calendarization, you know that Cheminova is much larger in Europe than FMC is. And Europe is a first quarter, beginning of second quarter, market. So you could have a very large amount of sales shifting in between February, March and April. And today, we don't really know where they are. Antitrust rules forbid us to look at what Cheminova is doing. So we have no visibility how their sales are unfolding within those 3 months. And if they are beginning in February, they will most likely be lower in March, or they could all be in March and April. So that creates a very large range for us. The underlying business, as we see it today, if we think about operating within a flattish or low single-digit market globally, we would see our business in the low-single digit positive growth. That's where we would be seeing the core underlying business. The 2%, 3% range will be something which we would expect to see."

First, if you look at the reduction from $220 million to $150 million, $170 million, so reduction '15 and going forward versus '14, there is a few reasons for that. First of all, Alkali tend to be a business which is slightly more capital-intensive than the other businesses. So it will not be part of the portfolio where you know we tend to operate ag on an asset-light business. So there is a capital intensity which is different between those 2 business. Also with the completion of the MCC plant, we have way less capital to spend even if we make it more flexible with the pharmaceutical line than the $100 million we've spent over the last 2 years. So you're going to have a -- at this point, the way we look at Health and Nutrition, we have capacity. It's a matter of rationalization and optimization of our footprint, but we have capacity. So you bring together the fact that we have -- we are -- we have the capacity that we need in Health and Nutrition; we have an asset-light business model, even with the acquisition of Cheminova; and we have less of an intensity with Alkali leading the portfolio, that will reduce the capital utilization for the next -- for the years to come. So I would say the number you have in front of us for 2015 is going to be a pretty typical number we're going to be facing for the years to come. The reduction versus where we were in term of forecast and where we are today, it's purely controlling capital spending in light of our -- in light of the economical situation in the ag business. I think we, like any company in that space, when you face a slowdown in the business, you just control your capital. We are certainly seeing way less growth in 2015 and '16 in that business than we saw 2 or 3 years ago. So certainly, a reduction in capital spending. So we've just been managing very, very carefully capital over the last 4, 5 months, when it became clear that 2015 would be a challenging year for companies in the ag world."

When I look at our receivables balance today, as we say, it really is almost entirely driven by Brazil. There is no doubt that the comments Pierre made with regard to inventory levels being elevated in Brazil will have an impact on collection rates through 2015. And so while we don't expect the working capital balance to increase during the year, we'll ultimately expect the receivables balance to make a shift back down to historical levels within the space of a single season.

Now, if we close end of February, early March, we are okay. If it gets pushed, the more it gets pushed, the more difficult it is. So if -- as we have all the reason in the world to expect a close in the first quarter, we'll be within the $35-million range."

There is multiple factors which are coming at play and it's why the recovery is on the slower side. First, there was all of this issue we talked about before on protein prices, which have been really decreasing the overall consumption in Asia, China or Indonesia for the peanut, milk or some of the dairy-based product. So it has been, first, a slowdown in the market, which led many of our customers to have too much inventory and not needing to buy from us. That was one aspect, and we believe it was more of the main reason for the slowdown. But there is another market dynamic, which is taking place and enforcing us to look to adjust our portfolio. It's always the same. It's always a challenge, but it's also an opportunity. What we are seeing is very different type of protein milk now, which are growing in this market following the success of peanut milk. So the usage of MCC, which was for us, we are one of the pioneer in this application with our MCC product line to develop this market with our customers, the success has created now a new product, which are requiring different formulation, different applications for us. So there is an adjustment on the type of product, and we are in the middle of developing the product to participate in the growth of those new beverage. Those new product will also be supplied. They are the same chemistry as the one we have for peanut milk. They will also be supplied from our current plant, and in the future, from a plant in Asia. But there is a shift in the market which could lead to new opportunities and new challenges. So all of that, the shifting elements, are creating a slow recovery for us, but it's not like we are back to a single beverage with the inventory of the customers and we are growing back. So a bit complex from a consumer standpoint."

We are confident, given their successful track record, that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. 
Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter.
In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventories in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton.  Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous-year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture.  Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally, and glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. 
In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicides that address weed-resistance issues in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn-focused products. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA Prospective Planting report is issued later this month. 
Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions.  
Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid, with stable acreage in oilseed rape and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter.
In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia, and especially in India, driving increased pharmaceutical excipients volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft.
Market conditions for Lithium products were mixed. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014 with the decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other applications is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage applications continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has led to a tightening in some segments and created for a more favorable pricing environment, especially for lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing.
Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this later, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefit from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further.
Today, as we review the segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance.
With that, I will now turn to segment results. 
Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil, specifically, delayed planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. 
In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sales in low-margin, third-party product, contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybeans, as the need for residual herbicides, such as our Authority brands, continue to expand.
In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. 
As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly in anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold a higher volume of pre-emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new active ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of our platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. 
As we look at the market for 2015, current data suggests that growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to de-risk their field. At current grain prices and with stocking use [ph] at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag chem markets are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015.
Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, accelerate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies.
Now looking at the 2015 ag market by region. In Brazil, drier-than-normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. These elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work through excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, cotton area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat.
Weather conditions for sugarcane, while better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the competitive environment remains high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics, serving as a potential demand stimulus. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. 
Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year, with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels.
Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Weed resistance remains a growing concern across both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. As in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking these together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits.
In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed rape markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and led to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode [ph] condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low-single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014.
In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. Rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low-single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. 
Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC.
First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than 1 month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances.
For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year, with higher herbicide demand offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year, with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until second quarter. As a result, we expect a challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment.
For the full year, continued spread of weed resistance in North America and Latin America, and market share gains in Asia and EMEA, will offset pricing pressures and provide earnings growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014.
Now turning to Health and Nutrition. 
Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1%, and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. 
In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid. Specifically, demand for our Avicel brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, the market that supports generic tablets production for Western use.
Similar to last quarter, our nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the original mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends, while demand for nutraceutical products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high-concentration application.
In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that we expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. 
Additionally, as part of this program, we have decided to delay the Thailand MCC plant opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to our Thailand plant provides greater long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plans at our Investor Day and throughout the year.
For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India; and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid-single-digit percent over 2014.
First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and led to an unplanned outage of alginate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of colloidal MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. 
And now, let me review Minerals.
Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4%, and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Record production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the first -- fourth quarter of 2013.
In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous-year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable freight and logistic adjustments, and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability.
In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous-year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide, largely used in electric-vehicle batteries, was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low-teens percent in 2014.
However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina, as we're unable to counteract increasing cost trends.
In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be a significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce cost as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate.
Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all required regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be prompt and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. 
We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November and were extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on disco",1196,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. 
We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow, before the separation and M&A-related spending, was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million.
After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better, and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less than in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American Ag Solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand.
Despite this, our Agricultural Solutions business, and Brazil in particular, remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil than recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015.
And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow on CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within the range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees.
A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings, with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high-tax countries of the U.S. and Brazil than forecast, as well as the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December.
The full year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full reconciliation of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules.
In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the higher foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015.
Now moving on to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. 
In 2014, the net impact of foreign currency movements on our reported EBIT was approximately $20 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This consisted of a mix of transaction, translation and hedging cost impacts. Agricultural Solutions carried most of these costs in its segment results. The largest currencies which we carry exposure to are the euro, the Brazilian reais, the Chinese renminbi, followed by the Argentine peso and various Asian currencies. And we expect most of these to continue to exhibit greater volatility relative to the dollar in 2015.
In 2015, the impact of the strengthening dollar will be mixed for FMC. At the most basic level, sales we make in currencies that devalue will be lower in U.S. dollar terms, putting pressure on sales growth when reported in U.S. dollars. This is especially the case in our Health and Nutrition and Cheminova businesses, given their relatively large euro exposures.
However, we also have a significant cost base in Europe, meaning the impact on our earnings will be far more limited than the impact on revenue. Equally important, we expect those products we manufacture in Europe for export to the U.S. will have a lower cost in U.S. dollar terms.
In Brazil, a devaluing reais is generally a positive to our business, although there is no doubt it is likely to influence some of the dynamics of our operations there. We price and invoice largely in U.S. dollars and our customers receive the vast majority of their revenues in U.S. dollars. However, growers typically incur half or more of their total expenses in reais. This clearly improves the profitability of growers in reais terms, partially shielding them from the depreciation in global agricultural crop prices and creating an incentive to incur more costs locally, where possible.
With increased volatility in exchange rates, we expect to see higher cost of hedging in 2015 for all major currencies. Unlike in prior years, we are not providing a formal full-year EPS guidance with our earnings today. However, based upon the best judgment we have right now, we expect 2015 earnings to be in the range of $3.50 and $3.90 per share. To place this in the context of 2014 earnings, let me provide a bridge between the 2014 EPS and the midpoint of this range.
First of all, the addition of 10 months of Cheminova earnings, including synergies; growth in the earnings contribution from our current ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses; and the loss of the Alkali earnings, will collectively reduce EPS by $0.10. Increases in corporate costs, primarily due to higher expected incentive payments, will be a headwind of a further $0.07; and higher interest expense will reduce EPS by $0.06.
Finally, a tax rate higher than the unusually low rate we saw in '14 will reduce EPS by an additional $0.12 per share. This bridge is centered on the midpoint of a range, which itself is much wider than we would typically provide. This is largely due to the impact that the timing of the Cheminova close has upon our ability to accurately forecast our Ag business today, especially in respect to the calendarization of Cheminova earnings and the timing of synergy realization. 
In addition, the delay in the closing has prevented us from spending time with Cheminova management to understand their latest expectations for 2015, a process that is critical for us to complete before we can provide detailed full year and quarterly guidance.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Agricultural Solutions will continue its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiatives. The acquisition of Cheminova enhances our business, provides greater balance to our portfolio, broadens our geographic reach and accelerates our innovation efforts. 
Our Health and Nutrition business continues to demonstrate the strength of our franchise with high margin and predictable growth. We expect our manufacturing excellence programs will deliver additional upside, reinforcing our confidence in the prospects for this business.
In Lithium, underlying demand patterns remain attractive, and market dynamics suggest we will see increased pricing opportunities in the coming years. We will continue to manage our assets in order to maximize returns from the downstream market, where we have a leading position, and we will continue to drive operational excellence as a tool to help offset cost inflation in our Argentina operations.
Today, we are demonstrating progress toward a portfolio focused on agricultural, health and nutrition end markets. The attractive price we achieved in the Alkali sale will allow us to pay down Cheminova acquisition debt more quickly. And the benefits we will deliver from revenue and cost synergies from Cheminova will ensure our earnings growth outperforms the broad ag market.
Across all of our businesses, 2015 will be an important year for FMC. Although we recognize that near-term visibility is muted, we remain very excited about our prospects through 2015 and beyond.
I look forward to seeing you in April to provide more detail on the plans that we are putting in place and to provide more guidance on both near-term performance and the long-range vision we have for FMC.

And what we mean by calendarization, you know that Cheminova is much larger in Europe than FMC is. And Europe is a first-quarter, beginning-of-second-quarter, market. So you could have a very large amount of sales shifting in between February, March and April. And today, we don't really know where they are. Antitrust rules forbid us to look at what Cheminova is doing. So we have no visibility how their sales are unfolding within those 3 months. And if they are big in February, they will most likely be lower in March, or they could all be in March and April. So that creates a very large range for us. The underlying business, as we see it today, if we think about operating within a flattish or low-single-digit market globally, we would see our business in the low-single-digit positive growth. That's where we would be seeing the core underlying business. The 2%, 3% range will be something which we would expect to see."

First, if you look at the reduction from $220 million to $150 million, $170 million, so reduction '15 and going forward versus '14, there is a few reasons for that. First of all, Alkali tend to be a business which is slightly more capital intensive than the other businesses. So it will not be part of the portfolio, where you know we tend to operate ag on an asset-light business. So there is a capital intensity which is different between those 2 businesses. Also with the completion of the MCC plant, we have way less capital to spend even if we make it more flexible with the pharmaceutical line than the $100 million we've spent over the last 2 years. So you're going to have a -- at this point, the way we look at Health and Nutrition, we have capacity. It's a matter of rationalization and optimization of our footprint, but we have capacity. So you bring together the fact that we have -- we are -- we have the capacity that we need in Health and Nutrition; we have an asset-light business model, even with the acquisition of Cheminova; and we have less of an intensity with Alkali leading the portfolio, that will reduce the capital utilization for the next -- for the years to come. So I would say the number you have in front of us for 2015 is going to be a pretty typical number we're going to be facing for the years to come. The reduction versus where we were in term of forecast and where we are today, it's purely controlling capital spending in light of our -- in light of the economical situation in the ag business. I think we -- like any company in that space, when you face a slowdown in the business, you just control your capital. We are certainly seeing way less growth in 2015 and '16 in that business than we saw 2 or 3 years ago. So certainly, a reduction in capital spending. So we've just been managing very, very carefully capital over the last 4, 5 months, when it became clear that 2015 would be a challenging year for companies in the ag world."

If you look at historical data for Cheminova, they would make their numbers for Europe some time from early February to April, May, but it could happen any time, any month, you could have a big sale. So that is the question we have today. We could be very much in line overall for 12 months, but remember, maximum we'll get 10 months.

There is multiple factors which are coming at play, and it's why the recovery is on the slower side. First, there was all of this issue we talked about before on protein prices, which have been really decreasing the overall consumption in Asia, China or Indonesia for the peanut milk or some of the dairy-based product. So it has been, first, a slowdown in the market, which led many of our customers to have too much inventory and not needing to buy from us. That was one aspect, and we believe it was more of the main reason for the slowdown. But there is another market dynamic which is taking place and forcing us to look to adjust our portfolio. It's always the same. It's always a challenge, but it's also an opportunity. What we are seeing is there is different type of protein milk now, which are growing in this market following the success of peanut milk. So the usage of MCC, which was for us -- we are one of the pioneer in this application with our MCC product line to develop this market with our customers. The success has created now a new product, which are requiring different formulation, different applications for us. So there is an adjustment on the type of product, and we are in the middle of developing the product to participate in the growth of those new beverage. Those new product will also be supplied -- they are the same chemistry as the one we have for peanut milk. They will also be supplied from our current plant, and in the future, from a plant in Asia. But there is a shift in the market which could lead to new opportunities and new challenges. So all of that, the shifting elements, are creating a slow recovery for us, but it's not like we are back to a single beverage with the inventory down at the customers and we are growing back.

Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to introduce Eric Norris and Tom Schneberger, both named to their positions recently. Each has held leadership positions across multiple businesses within FMC and bring a wealth of experience to these roles. We are confident, given their successful track record, that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. 
Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter.
In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventories in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton.  Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous-year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture.  Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally, and glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. 
In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicides that address weed-resistance issues in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn-focused products. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA Prospective Planting report is issued later this month. 
Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions.  
Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid, with stable acreage in oilseed rape and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter.
In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia, and especially in India, driving increased pharmaceutical excipients volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft.
Market conditions for Lithium products were mixed. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014 with the decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other applications is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage applications continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has led to a tightening in some segments and created for a more favorable pricing environment, especially for lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing.
Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this later, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefit from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further.
Today, as we review the segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance.
With that, I will now turn to segment results. 
Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil, specifically, delayed planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. 
In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sales in low-margin, third-party product, contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybeans, as the need for residual herbicides, such as our Authority brands, continue to expand.
In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. 
As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly in anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold a higher volume of pre-emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new active ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of our platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. 
As we look at the market for 2015, current data suggests that growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to de-risk their field. At current grain prices and with stocking use [ph] at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag chem markets are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015.
Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, accelerate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies.
Now looking at the 2015 ag market by region. In Brazil, drier-than-normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. These elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work through excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, cotton area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat.
Weather conditions for sugarcane, while better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the competitive environment remains high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics, serving as a potential demand stimulus. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. 
Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year, with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels.
Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Weed resistance remains a growing concern across both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. As in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking these together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits.
In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed rape markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and led to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode [ph] condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low-single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014.
In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. Rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low-single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. 
Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC.
First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than 1 month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances.
For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year, with higher herbicide demand offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year, with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until second quarter. As a result, we expect a challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment.
For the full year, continued spread of weed resistance in North America and Latin America, and market share gains in Asia and EMEA, will offset pricing pressures and provide earnings growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014.
Now turning to Health and Nutrition. 
Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1%, and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. 
In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid. Specifically, demand for our Avicel brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, the market that supports generic tablets production for Western use.
Similar to last quarter, our nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the original mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends, while demand for nutraceutical products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high-concentration application.
In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that we expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. 
Additionally, as part of this program, we have decided to delay the Thailand MCC plant opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to our Thailand plant provides greater long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plans at our Investor Day and throughout the year.
For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India; and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid-single-digit percent over 2014.
First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and led to an unplanned outage of alginate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of colloidal MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. 
And now, let me review Minerals.
Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4%, and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Record production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the first -- fourth quarter of 2013.
In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous-year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable freight and logistic adjustments, and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability.
In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous-year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide, largely used in electric-vehicle batteries, was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low-teens percent in 2014.
However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina, as we're unable to counteract increasing cost trends.
In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be a significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce cost as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate.
Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all required regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be prompt and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. 
We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November and were extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on disco",1196,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. 
We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow, before the separation and M&A-related spending, was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million.
After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better, and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less than in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American Ag Solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand.
Despite this, our Agricultural Solutions business, and Brazil in particular, remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil than recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015.
And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow on CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within the range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees.
A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings, with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high-tax countries of the U.S. and Brazil than forecast, as well as the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December.
The full year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full reconciliation of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules.
In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the higher foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015.
Now moving on to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. 
In 2014, the net impact of foreign currency movements on our reported EBIT was approximately $20 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This consisted of a mix of transaction, translation and hedging cost impacts. Agricultural Solutions carried most of these costs in its segment results. The largest currencies which we carry exposure to are the euro, the Brazilian reais, the Chinese renminbi, followed by the Argentine peso and various Asian currencies. And we expect most of these to continue to exhibit greater volatility relative to the dollar in 2015.
In 2015, the impact of the strengthening dollar will be mixed for FMC. At the most basic level, sales we make in currencies that devalue will be lower in U.S. dollar terms, putting pressure on sales growth when reported in U.S. dollars. This is especially the case in our Health and Nutrition and Cheminova businesses, given their relatively large euro exposures.
However, we also have a significant cost base in Europe, meaning the impact on our earnings will be far more limited than the impact on revenue. Equally important, we expect those products we manufacture in Europe for export to the U.S. will have a lower cost in U.S. dollar terms.
In Brazil, a devaluing reais is generally a positive to our business, although there is no doubt it is likely to influence some of the dynamics of our operations there. We price and invoice largely in U.S. dollars and our customers receive the vast majority of their revenues in U.S. dollars. However, growers typically incur half or more of their total expenses in reais. This clearly improves the profitability of growers in reais terms, partially shielding them from the depreciation in global agricultural crop prices and creating an incentive to incur more costs locally, where possible.
With increased volatility in exchange rates, we expect to see higher cost of hedging in 2015 for all major currencies. Unlike in prior years, we are not providing a formal full-year EPS guidance with our earnings today. However, based upon the best judgment we have right now, we expect 2015 earnings to be in the range of $3.50 and $3.90 per share. To place this in the context of 2014 earnings, let me provide a bridge between the 2014 EPS and the midpoint of this range.
First of all, the addition of 10 months of Cheminova earnings, including synergies; growth in the earnings contribution from our current ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses; and the loss of the Alkali earnings, will collectively reduce EPS by $0.10. Increases in corporate costs, primarily due to higher expected incentive payments, will be a headwind of a further $0.07; and higher interest expense will reduce EPS by $0.06.
Finally, a tax rate higher than the unusually low rate we saw in '14 will reduce EPS by an additional $0.12 per share. This bridge is centered on the midpoint of a range, which itself is much wider than we would typically provide. This is largely due to the impact that the timing of the Cheminova close has upon our ability to accurately forecast our Ag business today, especially in respect to the calendarization of Cheminova earnings and the timing of synergy realization. 
In addition, the delay in the closing has prevented us from spending time with Cheminova management to understand their latest expectations for 2015, a process that is critical for us to complete before we can provide detailed full year and quarterly guidance.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Agricultural Solutions will continue its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiatives. The acquisition of Cheminova enhances our business, provides greater balance to our portfolio, broadens our geographic reach and accelerates our innovation efforts. 
Our Health and Nutrition business continues to demonstrate the strength of our franchise with high margin and predictable growth. We expect our manufacturing excellence programs will deliver additional upside, reinforcing our confidence in the prospects for this business.
In Lithium, underlying demand patterns remain attractive, and market dynamics suggest we will see increased pricing opportunities in the coming years. We will continue to manage our assets in order to maximize returns from the downstream market, where we have a leading position, and we will continue to drive operational excellence as a tool to help offset cost inflation in our Argentina operations.
Today, we are demonstrating progress toward a portfolio focused on agricultural, health and nutrition end markets. The attractive price we achieved in the Alkali sale will allow us to pay down Cheminova acquisition debt more quickly. And the benefits we will deliver from revenue and cost synergies from Cheminova will ensure our earnings growth outperforms the broad ag market.
Across all of our businesses, 2015 will be an important year for FMC. Although we recognize that near-term visibility is muted, we remain very excited about our prospects through 2015 and beyond.

Antitrust rules forbid us to look at what Cheminova is doing. So we have no visibility how their sales are unfolding within those 3 months.

And I was wondering if you could talk through how you're thinking about capital deployment, what the key decrements might be in those changes.

First, if you look at the reduction from $220 million to $150 million, $170 million, so reduction '15 and going forward versus '14, there is a few reasons for that. First of all, Alkali tend to be a business which is slightly more capital intensive than the other businesses. So it will not be part of the portfolio, where you know we tend to operate ag on an asset-light business. So there is a capital intensity which is different between those 2 businesses. Also with the completion of the MCC plant, we have way less capital to spend even if we make it more flexible with the pharmaceutical line than the $100 million we've spent over the last 2 years. So you're going to have a -- at this point, the way we look at Health and Nutrition, we have capacity. It's a matter of rationalization and optimization of our footprint, but we have capacity. So you bring together the fact that we have -- we are -- we have the capacity that we need in Health and Nutrition; we have an asset-light business model, even with the acquisition of Cheminova; and we have less of an intensity with Alkali leading the portfolio, that will reduce the capital utilization for the next -- for the years to come. So I would say the number you have in front of us for 2015 is going to be a pretty typical number we're going to be facing for the years to come. The reduction versus where we were in term of forecast and where we are today, it's purely controlling capital spending in light of our -- in light of the economical situation in the ag business. I think we -- like any company in that space, when you face a slowdown in the business, you just control your capital. We are certainly seeing way less growth in 2015 and '16 in that business than we saw 2 or 3 years ago. So certainly, a reduction in capital spending. So we've just been managing very, very carefully capital over the last 4, 5 months, when it became clear that 2015 would be a challenging year for companies in the ag world."

Our views on what the credit environment is and where we extend credit is absolutely factored in there. When I look at our receivables balance today, as we say, it really is almost entirely driven by Brazil. There is no doubt that the comments Pierre made with regard to inventory levels being elevated in Brazil will have an impact on collection rates through 2015. And so while we don't expect the working capital balance to increase during the year, we'll ultimately expect the receivables balance to make a shift back down to historical levels within the space of a single season. It's likely to take a little bit more than just 2015 to take it back down to historical levels."

There is multiple factors which are coming at play, and it's why the recovery is on the slower side. First, there was all of this issue we talked about before on protein prices, which have been really decreasing the overall consumption in Asia, China or Indonesia for the peanut milk or some of the dairy-based product. So it has been, first, a slowdown in the market, which led many of our customers to have too much inventory and not needing to buy from us. That was one aspect, and we believe it was more of the main reason for the slowdown. But there is another market dynamic which is taking place and forcing us to look to adjust our portfolio. It's always the same. It's always a challenge, but it's also an opportunity. What we are seeing is there is different type of protein milk now, which are growing in this market following the success of peanut milk. So the usage of MCC, which was for us -- we are one of the pioneer in this application with our MCC product line to develop this market with our customers. The success has created now a new product, which are requiring different formulation, different applications for us. So there is an adjustment on the type of product, and we are in the middle of developing the product to participate in the growth of those new beverage. Those new product will also be supplied -- they are the same chemistry as the one we have for peanut milk. They will also be supplied from our current plant, and in the future, from a plant in Asia. But there is a shift in the market which could lead to new opportunities and new challenges. So all of that, the shifting elements, are creating a slow recovery for us, but it's not like we are back to a single beverage with the inventory down at the customers and we are growing back. So a bit more complex from a consumer standpoint."

We are confident, given their successful track record, that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. 
Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter.
In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventories in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton.  Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous-year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture.  Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally, and glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. 
In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicides that address weed-resistance issues in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn-focused products. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA Prospective Planting report is issued later this month. 
Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions.  
Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid, with stable acreage in oilseed rape and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter.
In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia, and especially in India, driving increased pharmaceutical excipients volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft.
Market conditions for Lithium products were mixed. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014 with the decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other applications is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage applications continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has led to a tightening in some segments and created for a more favorable pricing environment, especially for lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing.
Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this later, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefit from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further.
Today, as we review the segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance.
With that, I will now turn to segment results. 
Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil, specifically, delayed planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. 
In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sales in low-margin, third-party product, contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybeans, as the need for residual herbicides, such as our Authority brands, continue to expand.
In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. 
As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly in anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold a higher volume of pre-emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new active ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of our platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. 
As we look at the market for 2015, current data suggests that growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to de-risk their field. At current grain prices and with stocking use [ph] at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag chem markets are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015.
Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, accelerate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies.
Now looking at the 2015 ag market by region. In Brazil, drier-than-normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. These elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work through excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, cotton area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat.
Weather conditions for sugarcane, while better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the competitive environment remains high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics, serving as a potential demand stimulus. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. 
Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year, with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels.
Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Weed resistance remains a growing concern across both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. As in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking these together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits.
In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed rape markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and led to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode [ph] condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low-single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014.
In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. Rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low-single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. 
Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC.
First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than 1 month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances.
For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year, with higher herbicide demand offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year, with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until second quarter. As a result, we expect a challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment.
For the full year, continued spread of weed resistance in North America and Latin America, and market share gains in Asia and EMEA, will offset pricing pressures and provide earnings growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014.
Now turning to Health and Nutrition. 
Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1%, and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. 
In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid. Specifically, demand for our Avicel brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, the market that supports generic tablets production for Western use.
Similar to last quarter, our nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the original mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends, while demand for nutraceutical products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high-concentration application.
In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that we expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. 
Additionally, as part of this program, we have decided to delay the Thailand MCC plant opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to our Thailand plant provides greater long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plans at our Investor Day and throughout the year.
For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India; and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid-single-digit percent over 2014.
First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and led to an unplanned outage of alginate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of colloidal MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. 
And now, let me review Minerals.
Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4%, and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Record production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the first -- fourth quarter of 2013.
In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous-year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable freight and logistic adjustments, and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability.
In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous-year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide, largely used in electric-vehicle batteries, was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low-teens percent in 2014.
However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina, as we're unable to counteract increasing cost trends.
In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be a significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce cost as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate.
Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all required regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be prompt and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. 
We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November and were extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."
28606,280246979,757745,"FMC Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on disco",1196,"Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with a review of cash flow. 
We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow, before the separation and M&A-related spending, was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million.
After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better, and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less than in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American Ag Solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand.
Despite this, our Agricultural Solutions business, and Brazil in particular, remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil than recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015.
And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow on CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within the range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees.
A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings, with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high-tax countries of the U.S. and Brazil than forecast, as well as the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December.
The full year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full reconciliation of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules.
In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the higher foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015.
Now moving on to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. 
In 2014, the net impact of foreign currency movements on our reported EBIT was approximately $20 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This consisted of a mix of transaction, translation and hedging cost impacts. Agricultural Solutions carried most of these costs in its segment results. The largest currencies which we carry exposure to are the euro, the Brazilian reais, the Chinese renminbi, followed by the Argentine peso and various Asian currencies. And we expect most of these to continue to exhibit greater volatility relative to the dollar in 2015.
In 2015, the impact of the strengthening dollar will be mixed for FMC. At the most basic level, sales we make in currencies that devalue will be lower in U.S. dollar terms, putting pressure on sales growth when reported in U.S. dollars. This is especially the case in our Health and Nutrition and Cheminova businesses, given their relatively large euro exposures.
However, we also have a significant cost base in Europe, meaning the impact on our earnings will be far more limited than the impact on revenue. Equally important, we expect those products we manufacture in Europe for export to the U.S. will have a lower cost in U.S. dollar terms.
In Brazil, a devaluing reais is generally a positive to our business, although there is no doubt it is likely to influence some of the dynamics of our operations there. We price and invoice largely in U.S. dollars and our customers receive the vast majority of their revenues in U.S. dollars. However, growers typically incur half or more of their total expenses in reais. This clearly improves the profitability of growers in reais terms, partially shielding them from the depreciation in global agricultural crop prices and creating an incentive to incur more costs locally, where possible.
With increased volatility in exchange rates, we expect to see higher cost of hedging in 2015 for all major currencies. Unlike in prior years, we are not providing a formal full-year EPS guidance with our earnings today. However, based upon the best judgment we have right now, we expect 2015 earnings to be in the range of $3.50 and $3.90 per share. To place this in the context of 2014 earnings, let me provide a bridge between the 2014 EPS and the midpoint of this range.
First of all, the addition of 10 months of Cheminova earnings, including synergies; growth in the earnings contribution from our current ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses; and the loss of the Alkali earnings, will collectively reduce EPS by $0.10. Increases in corporate costs, primarily due to higher expected incentive payments, will be a headwind of a further $0.07; and higher interest expense will reduce EPS by $0.06.
Finally, a tax rate higher than the unusually low rate we saw in '14 will reduce EPS by an additional $0.12 per share. This bridge is centered on the midpoint of a range, which itself is much wider than we would typically provide. This is largely due to the impact that the timing of the Cheminova close has upon our ability to accurately forecast our Ag business today, especially in respect to the calendarization of Cheminova earnings and the timing of synergy realization. 
In addition, the delay in the closing has prevented us from spending time with Cheminova management to understand their latest expectations for 2015, a process that is critical for us to complete before we can provide detailed full year and quarterly guidance.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

We are confident, given their successful track record, that they will provide the right leadership for the Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses. 
Now I would like to start with some comments on market conditions in the fourth quarter.
In Agricultural markets, we saw difficult market conditions in Brazil during the fourth quarter, including weak demand in sugarcane and cotton and high channel inventories in all areas. Acres were planted much later than normal during the season and resulted in lower-than-expected demand for crop protection products, particularly for cotton.  Together, this led to weaker performance in Brazil than the previous-year quarter. In other parts of Latin America, markets remained strong, especially in Mexico and Argentina. Mexico is currently benefiting from increasing demand for vegetable export and a government program to invest in agriculture.  Argentina now grows the third largest soybean crop globally, and glad to say resistance continues to spread. This is leading to continuing demand growth for FMC's pre-emergent herbicide. 
In North America, we saw stronger demand for herbicides that address weed-resistance issues in soybeans and rice, and reduced demand for corn-focused products. This is consistent with third-party expectation that soy acres will be larger than corn acres in 2015. We expect to get more information on the extent of this trend when the USDA Prospective Planting report is issued later this month. 
Most Asian markets were stronger, but results were reduced by the impact of currency translation, as most regional currencies weakened against the dollar. We saw underlying demand growth in China, Indonesia and India, although Australia continued to be affected by drought conditions.  
Crop protection markets in Europe remained solid, with stable acreage in oilseed rape and cereals. Coming off a strong growing season and supported by moderate winter condition, demand for herbicides remained steady in the fourth quarter.
In Health and Nutrition, we saw demand in Asia, and especially in India, driving increased pharmaceutical excipients volumes. Demand for texture and stability solutions in North America was greater than the previous year. However, the Chinese beverage market continued to be soft.
Market conditions for Lithium products were mixed. Demand for butylithium softened during 2014 with the decision by a large European customer to change its process and no longer use butylithium. However, demand for this product in other applications is increasing. Lithium demand for energy storage applications continues to grow at double-digit rates. This has led to a tightening in some segments and created for a more favorable pricing environment, especially for lithium hydroxide. We also saw some tightening in carbonate supply and demand, which we expect will also lead to favorable year-over-year pricing.
Currency volatility was a factor in the fourth quarter. Paul will provide more details on this later, but it was a net headwind in the quarter, mostly in ag business. In light of these factors and market conditions, in the fourth quarter, FMC generated $1.1 billion in revenue, a 3% decrease over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 6% increase compared to last year, and adjusted EPS was $1.12, an increase of 7% over last year. This includes an $0.08 benefit from tax adjustments that Paul will explain further.
Today, as we review the segment performance for the fourth quarter 2014, I will provide a view into each segment's earnings outlook for the full year 2015. I will also comment on some of the factors that will influence first quarter performance.
With that, I will now turn to segment results. 
Fourth quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $627 million, a 7% decrease over last year's record fourth quarter. Segment earnings were $130 million, down 5% over last year. As I already mentioned, this performance was primarily due to slower demand in Brazil, specifically, delayed planting and lower cotton acreage reduced insecticide and herbicide volumes. 
In sugarcane, conditions remained weak despite improvement from earlier in the year. The rapid industry-wide slowdown highlighted the elevated levels of inventory in multiple channels in Brazil, and these contributed to increased pricing pressure and softer volume across all segments. We continued to see positive momentum with increased penetration in soybean. Importantly, we reduced our sales in low-margin, third-party product, contributing to an improved EBIT margin in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we saw higher demand for our products in Argentina, Mexico and North America. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter, our joint venture in Argentina successfully gained share in key markets. This was especially the case in soybeans, as the need for residual herbicides, such as our Authority brands, continue to expand.
In Mexico, as I mentioned, the increase of vegetable export has led to higher demand for insecticide and fungicide products. The peso devaluation has stimulated demand for growers to produce more for U.S. exports. 
As you are aware, fourth quarter sales in North America are mainly in anticipation of the next growing season. In the quarter, as expected, we sold a higher volume of pre-emergent herbicides for soybeans, which was offset by lower year-over-year demand for corn insecticides. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of a new active ingredient originally discovered by Kumiai Chemical. For the year, we collaborated with Kumiai developing this important molecule. It is one of our platform chemistries, and we are very excited by its potential. We look forward to providing additional insight as part of our R&D review at our Investor Day. 
As we look at the market for 2015, current data suggests that growers in both North America and Latin America, will favor planting soybeans over corn to de-risk their field. At current grain prices and with stocking use [ph] at high levels, we are likely to see pricing pressures global for some crop protection products. In light of this, we believe that global ag chem markets are likely to be flat to slightly lower in 2015.
Without a catalyst to change the currency pricing environment, markets could remain flat into 2016. For FMC, this is a significant opportunity to outperform the market and our competitors as we take advantage of the Cheminova integration to reduce operating costs, accelerate innovation and develop and deliver new revenue synergies.
Now looking at the 2015 ag market by region. In Brazil, drier-than-normal condition delayed the past planting season for soy and cotton growers, leading to high inventory throughout the distribution channel. These elevated levels will certainly be a factor in the first half of the year as growers work through excess stocks. There was an increase in soybean planted area, and we expect this trend to continue this year. However, cotton area was reduced by nearly 10%, and we anticipate the area to remain flat.
Weather conditions for sugarcane, while better, have not yet returned to optimal conditions and the competitive environment remains high. Government action on ethanol and gasoline prices will play an important role in improving sugarcane economics, serving as a potential demand stimulus. As a result, a slow recovery is expected to take place over the year in this market. 
Continuing pest pressures and resistance, along with previously mentioned additional soybean acres, will offset some of the slower demand. Overall, the Brazil crop protection chemicals market is expected to be broadly flat versus last year, with a slow first half as the industry works down channel inventory levels.
Planting intention in the United States suggest additional acres of soybean will be planted at the expense of corn and cotton acres. Weed resistance remains a growing concern across both soy and corn acres and will drive additional demand for selective residual herbicide. As in other regions, we expect fungicide and insecticide to see the most pressure during 2015 growing season. Taking these together, the market in North America is expected to be down mid-single digits.
In EMEA, acreage is expected to remain stable in cereals and oilseed rape markets. Conditions in 2014 were exceptional and led to a record year for the crop protection market. In light of last year's performance, the industry expects normal mode [ph] condition in 2015, and excluding the impact of currency, this market is expected to be down low-single-digit percent compared to a very strong 2014.
In Asia, we expect increased demand for crop protection products in most markets. The potential for a better monsoon season is providing optimism for 2015 performance. Rice acres in the region are expected to remain stable to last year, but are expected to use additional crop protection products to maintain yields. Cereal acreage is also expected to be consistent with last year. Across the region, crop protection is expected to be up low-single-digit percent, excluding the impact of currency. 
Let me now comment on how these market characteristics will affect FMC.
First, we are on track to close the Cheminova acquisition within this quarter. Our integration plans are ready, and we will aggressively begin implementation as soon as we close. However, we will have no more than 1 month of combined operations during the first quarter. Our revenue and cost synergies will be a top priority as we accelerate integration efforts. As such, we expect a strong progression of earnings contribution as the year advances.
For the first quarter, we expect a slow start to the year. North America is expected to be flat to last year, with higher herbicide demand offset by reduced insecticide sales. EMEA and Asia are also expected to be flat to last year, with some growth coming later in the year. And as I said, we do not expect the acquisition to provide meaningful benefits until second quarter. As a result, we expect a challenging first quarter in the Ag Solutions segment.
For the full year, continued spread of weed resistance in North America and Latin America, and market share gains in Asia and EMEA, will offset pricing pressures and provide earnings growth to our core business. We will supplement that with a disciplined approach to discretionary spending. In addition, as we target and aggressively realize the cost and revenue synergies, along with earnings contribution for Cheminova, we expect to deliver full year segment earnings 15% to 30% higher than 2014.
Now turning to Health and Nutrition. 
Fourth quarter segment revenues of $192 million increased 1%, and operating profit of $44 million was 9% higher than last year. Revenue growth was partially offset by the depreciating euro. Earnings growth was driven by a favorable product mix and benefits for restructuring programs initiated earlier in the year. These were partially offset by increased raw materials, mainly seaweed. 
In the quarter, demand in pharmaceutical end market remained solid. Specifically, demand for our Avicel brand was steady to last quarter and well above last year. This demand continues to be centered in India, the market that supports generic tablets production for Western use.
Similar to last quarter, our nutrition profitability benefit from changes to the original mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solutions partially offset a slower demand for beverage producers in China. Underlying demand for pharmaceutical-grade omega-3 is demonstrating favorable trends, while demand for nutraceutical products remained weak. We continue to focus our strategy toward the high-concentration application.
In the quarter, we launched a new restructuring initiative to improve operational efficiencies and streamline the footprint we acquired over the past few years. We anticipate that implementation will be spread over the first 3 quarters of 2015. Our previous Manufacturing Excellence programs have delivered benefit that we expect to replicate in Health and Nutrition. 
Additionally, as part of this program, we have decided to delay the Thailand MCC plant opening and add flexibility to the facility. Recognizing the increased demand for pharma excipients in India and weaker beverage market conditions in China, we believe adding pharmaceutical processing capabilities to our Thailand plant provides greater long-term flexibly to serve our customer base. We will update you on these restructuring plans at our Investor Day and throughout the year.
For 2015, we expect demand to have similar patterns as in 2014, including increased demand in health markets, particularly in India; and higher demand for nutrition products in North America. In the Chinese beverage market, we expect some recovery will lead to increased colloidal MCC volumes, although we do not expect a rapid return to demand levels seen prior to the slowdown. As a result, we expect segment earnings for the year to be up mid-single-digit percent over 2014.
First half performance will be impacted by recent condition in the North Sea, which prevented seaweed harvesting and led to an unplanned outage of alginate production. This has resulted in sales delays due to lack of available product. Combined with the softness of colloidal MCC in China that we have mentioned already, we're expecting Health and Nutrition first half performance to be flat versus the same period last year. 
And now, let me review Minerals.
Fourth quarter segment revenue of $274 million increased 4%, and operating profit of $48 million increased 32% versus the same period last year. Record production due to Manufacturing Excellence initiatives delivered volume and efficiency gains in alkali. Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both alkali and lithium led to increased profitability over the first -- fourth quarter of 2013.
In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $204 million increased by 7% over the previous-year quarter. Higher realized pricing, favorable freight and logistic adjustments, and additional manufacturing volume generated higher sales and profitability.
In Lithium, sales of $69 million were 3% lower than the previous-year quarter, mainly related to product mix, including the previously mentioned loss of a European butylithium customer. Pricing for lithium hydroxide, largely used in electric-vehicle batteries, was higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. And we were pleased that the business generated an operating margin in the low-teens percent in 2014.
However, during the second half of 2014, the business became more difficult to operate in Argentina, as we're unable to counteract increasing cost trends.
In 2015, we expect supply and demand for energy storage application will continue to support a favorable pricing environment for lithium hydroxide and carbonate. However, adverse currency conditions and escalating operating costs in Argentina are expected to be a significant headwind to earnings. As such, Lithium segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million for the full year. We are taking all actions in our control to reduce cost as much as possible, but Argentina remains a difficult place to operate.
Before I turn the call to Paul, let me comment briefly on the status of the Cheminova transaction. We have received all required regulatory approvals except 2 countries. We believe those approvals will be prompt and will allow us to close before the end of the first quarter. 
We were very pleased to announce the sale of Alkali to Tronox earlier this week for $1.64 billion, a multiple of 9.4x 2014 EBITDA. We launched the sale process in November and were extremely pleased with the level of interest. It was a very competitive process reflecting the high quality of the Alkali business, and we know that Tronox will be a great owner. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

We finished the year with cash from operations, before all separation and M&A-related spending, of approximately $470 million, an increase of 24% compared to 2013. With CapEx and spending on discontinued operations both lower than 2013, our free cash flow, before the separation and M&A-related spending, was more than double that of 2013 at approximately $200 million.
After accounting for all other demands on cash, including net M&A spending, dividends and separation and transaction-related expenses, our net debt at December 31 was $160 million lower than a year earlier. While we're pleased to have increased our cash flow in 2014, we believe we can do much better, and we continue to focus on trade working capital and capital spending as near-term drivers to improve free cash flow. Working capital consumed approximately $200 million of cash in 2014, which was about $50 million less than in 2013. This was largely due to a higher collection of prepayments for our North American Ag Solutions business compared to 2013, a good signal of 2015 demand.
Despite this, our Agricultural Solutions business, and Brazil in particular, remains the primary consumer of working capital. We continue to focus on the Brazil credit environment, and we're pleased with our collections during the fourth quarter. The balance remains higher in Brazil than recent years, and we continue to take a very disciplined approach to credit extension and collections. We expect working capital to remain broadly flat across all businesses in 2015.
And moving on to capital spending. Our total cash outflow on CapEx was $225 million, essentially flat to 2013, as we completed certain projects under budget and reduced our spending for other projects. For 2015, after removing the spending for Alkali, but including estimates for Cheminova, we expect total operating CapEx to be within the range of $150 million to $175 million for the year. And in the next couple of months, we expect to receive just over $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Alkali, net of all taxes and fees.
A brief comment on our tax rate. Our underlying adjusted tax rate in 2014 was approximately 24.5%, basically flat to last year and slightly better than we forecasted. This was due largely to benefits from geographic mix of earnings, with a larger proportion of our earnings taking place outside the high-tax countries of the U.S. and Brazil than forecast, as well as the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014 late in December.
The full year rate also benefited from one-off discrete items that were primarily a result of year-end revaluations of various tax balances using actual year-end exchange rates. These items reduced the full year rate by 160 basis points and the full benefits of this was seen in the fourth quarter, as we completed our year-end true up. The effect amounted to approximately $0.08 per share benefit for the quarter versus our expectations. We have again provided a full reconciliation of our tax rate in a separate note in our earnings release schedules.
In 2015, our underlying adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. The loss of certain tax deductions we were able to take as part of the Alkali operations, combined with the lack of an R&D tax credit being passed for 2015, are the primary drivers of this increase in our underlying tax rate. However, the higher foreign exchange volatility that we foresee will mean that our reported tax rate in any quarter is likely to become more volatile in 2015.

And as Paul said in his message, it is mostly due to the timing of closing and also due to the calendarization. And what we mean by calendarization, you know that Cheminova is much larger in Europe than FMC is. And Europe is a first-quarter, beginning-of-second-quarter, market. So you could have a very large amount of sales shifting in between February, March and April. And today, we don't really know where they are. Antitrust rules forbid us to look at what Cheminova is doing. So we have no visibility how their sales are unfolding within those 3 months. And if they are big in February, they will most likely be lower in March, or they could all be in March and April. So that creates a very large range for us. The underlying business, as we see it today, if we think about operating within a flattish or low-single-digit market globally, we would see our business in the low-single-digit positive growth. That's where we would be seeing the core underlying business. The 2%, 3% range will be something which we would expect to see."

First, if you look at the reduction from $220 million to $150 million, $170 million, so reduction '15 and going forward versus '14, there is a few reasons for that. First of all, Alkali tend to be a business which is slightly more capital intensive than the other businesses. So it will not be part of the portfolio, where you know we tend to operate ag on an asset-light business. So there is a capital intensity which is different between those 2 businesses. Also with the completion of the MCC plant, we have way less capital to spend even if we make it more flexible with the pharmaceutical line than the $100 million we've spent over the last 2 years. So you're going to have a -- at this point, the way we look at Health and Nutrition, we have capacity. It's a matter of rationalization and optimization of our footprint, but we have capacity. So you bring together the fact that we have -- we are -- we have the capacity that we need in Health and Nutrition; we have an asset-light business model, even with the acquisition of Cheminova; and we have less of an intensity with Alkali leading the portfolio, that will reduce the capital utilization for the next -- for the years to come. So I would say the number you have in front of us for 2015 is going to be a pretty typical number we're going to be facing for the years to come. The reduction versus where we were in term of forecast and where we are today, it's purely controlling capital spending in light of our -- in light of the economical situation in the ag business. I think we -- like any company in that space, when you face a slowdown in the business, you just control your capital. We are certainly seeing way less growth in 2015 and '16 in that business than we saw 2 or 3 years ago. So certainly, a reduction in capital spending. So we've just been managing very, very carefully capital over the last 4, 5 months, when it became clear that 2015 would be a challenging year for companies in the ag world."

Our views on what the credit environment is and where we extend credit is absolutely factored in there. When I look at our receivables balance today, as we say, it really is almost entirely driven by Brazil. There is no doubt that the comments Pierre made with regard to inventory levels being elevated in Brazil will have an impact on collection rates through 2015. And so while we don't expect the working capital balance to increase during the year, we'll ultimately expect the receivables balance to make a shift back down to historical levels within the space of a single season. It's likely to take a little bit more than just 2015 to take it back down to historical levels."

There is multiple factors which are coming at play, and it's why the recovery is on the slower side. First, there was all of this issue we talked about before on protein prices, which have been really decreasing the overall consumption in Asia, China or Indonesia for the peanut milk or some of the dairy-based product. So it has been, first, a slowdown in the market, which led many of our customers to have too much inventory and not needing to buy from us. That was one aspect, and we believe it was more of the main reason for the slowdown. But there is another market dynamic which is taking place and forcing us to look to adjust our portfolio. It's always the same. It's always a challenge, but it's also an opportunity. What we are seeing is there is different type of protein milk now, which are growing in this market following the success of peanut milk. So the usage of MCC, which was for us -- we are one of the pioneer in this application with our MCC product line to develop this market with our customers. The success has created now a new product, which are requiring different formulation, different applications for us. So there is an adjustment on the type of product, and we are in the middle of developing the product to participate in the growth of those new beverage. Those new product will also be supplied -- they are the same chemistry as the one we have for peanut milk. They will also be supplied from our current plant, and in the future, from a plant in Asia. But there is a shift in the market which could lead to new opportunities and new challenges. So all of that, the shifting elements, are creating a slow recovery for us, but it's not like we are back to a single beverage with the inventory down at the customers and we are growing back. So a bit more complex from a consumer standpoint."

In my comments, I will refer to the Q2 2015 earnings presentation posted on the FMC Investor Relations website.

In my comments, I will refer to the Q2 2015 earnings presentation posted on the FMC Investor Relations website. We have not used slides for previous earnings calls, but we have taken this approach today in order to help explain our results more clearly as we transition through 2015.
I will refer to each slide by slide number as I go. The second quarter of 2015 was perhaps the most significant quarter in the long history of FMC Corporation. We completed the sale of the Alkali business to Tronox and closed the acquisition of Cheminova. These transactions mark the completion of the transformation of FMC's portfolio to one focused on the Ag, Health and Nutrition markets. 
Following the close of the Cheminova transaction, we moved quickly to integrate Cheminova into FMC Ag Solutions. During this quarter, we took multiple actions that will drive strong future performance of FMC and allow us to deliver target synergies of $120 million ahead of 2015. In particular, we successfully combined commercial organizations in key regions earlier than we had originally expected, which means we are well-positioned to deliver the benefit of the acquisition more quickly than initially forecasted.
These recent changes, however, make it more difficult to compare the reported performance of Ag Solutions and Cheminova to their prior year's performance as standalone businesses even just a few months after closing. Consequently, we will focus, focus on comparing performance of Ag Solutions, including Cheminova, to the pro forma results of -- for prior period. The full year 2014 pro forma results were filed with the SEC on June 5. Pro forma results for the second quarter are included in the schedule of this quarterly earnings release issued yesterday.
Before discussing FMC's earnings for the quarter, I will make a few general comments on 2 of the factors that have had a significant impact on FMC's reported results: The state of the global crop protection market and impact of foreign exchange movements.
The global crop protection market continues to face multiple headwinds that have created one of the most challenging operating environment of the past decade. Demand from crop protections product remains weak, due to the high channel inventories, poor planting conditions, low pest pressures and soft agricultural community prices. Through the first 6 months of 2015, on a U.S. dollar basis, we estimate the global crop protection market was down by double-digit percent compared to the same period of 2014. Market conditions in Brazil are the most difficult. We estimate that through June, the crop protection market in Brazil was down approximately 25% compared to last year when measured in U.S. dollars.
Decline in demand reflected in lower volume are component by the rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real, which makes it harder for local currency piece list to keep pace with exchange rate movement, resulting in lower revenues when converted into U.S. dollars. 
In addition to the real, all of our major currency exposures have weakened against the U.S. dollar, creating a significant headwind to reported revenue and earnings across each of our businesses. The negative impact of foreign exchange and the challenging crop protection market, particularly in Brazil, overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance across the FMC portfolio.
During the call, I will highlight where unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations most impacted FMC's financial results. Turning to Slide 1. 
FMC reported $887 million in second quarter revenue, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit was $159 million for the second quarter, a 5% decrease compared to last year. And we reported $0.70 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 15% over the second quarter last year.
The benefits of ongoing cost reduction program and synergies related to the integration of Cheminova largely offset the impact of lower sales volume, higher interest expense and the higher tax rate in the quarter. However, price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset negative foreign currency fluctuation, which I will discuss in more detail in each segment.
Turning to Slide 2 and Ag Solutions. In order to provide greater clarity, as well as to be consistent with how FMC is currently operating the combined businesses, I will discuss segment performance on a pro forma basis, that is as though we owned Cheminova for the full quarter of 2014 and 2015.
On this basis, revenue in the quarter was $684 million and segment earnings were $117 million, a decline of 23% and 30%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Foreign exchange had a significant negative impact on segment revenue and earnings in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, pro forma revenues declined 14% while segment earnings increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Multiple factors contributed to this performance. First, let me focus on the regional crop protection markets and in particular, Brazil, the primary driver in the decline in sales volume compared to the second quarter of 2014. 
As I noted earlier, we believe the crop protection market in Brazil was down almost 25% through the first half of 2015. It is important to understand that this decline was not evenly spread across all product on crop segments. With respect to product segments, the volume decline was concentrated in insecticides.
We estimate that insecticides, which we would typically expect account for more than 40% of the market through the first 6 months of the year, were down 50% over this period, reflecting weak insect pressures and high channel inventories. Offsetting this decline was a 16% increase in the fungicide market, making fungicide the largest crop protection category in the first 6 months of the year. This mixed shift was dramatic and unlikely to persist through the remainder of 2015. However, it demonstrates how unusual the crop protection market in Brazil has been so far this year.
Historically, insecticides have contributed the largest product of FMC's revenue in Brazil for the first half of the year, while fungicide is a segment where FMC was historically underrepresented. The addition of Cheminova gives FMC a broader and more balanced product portfolio and enhances our future fungicide offerings.
In other countries, Latin America, we observed encouraging demand growth, particularly for selective herbicides in Argentina and niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. North America delivered another solid quarter. Demand for FMC's authority brand herbicide was strong compared to the second quarter of 2014, driven by the continued increase in life resistance anchorage.
In Europe, volumes were stable compared to last year, driven mainly by Cheminova sales in the region. We are very excited by the opportunities we see in Europe as we move to sell through Cheminova's direct access model in most of Europe for the 2016 season.
In Asia, we saw good results from newly launched product in China, specifically herbicides for wheat, and we saw further growth in Pakistan across the portfolio. Higher sales in these countries were partially offset by lower sales in Australia and Indonesia. Sales were also weaker in India, largely due to weak early monsoon season. 
Contributing to the decline in sales volume in the quarter were specific actions FMC took related to the way the new Ag Solutions segment we operate. First, we initiated a process to sell a Brazilian subsidiary, Consagro. This subsidiary is primarily a distributor of third-party product to smaller customers in Brazil. Given the opportunities that Cheminova portfolio brings, Consagro and its business model no longer fits with FMC. 
Second, we reduced our investments in certain FMC fungicide in Brazil selecting instead to shift a commercial focus to the fungicides portfolio acquired with Cheminova, which we believe will be vested to the crops and the reals that FMC targets. Third, we continue to reduce the level of third-party sales across all region, in particular, reducing sales of lower margin products that are less valued by our customer.
Lastly, and very importantly, given the underlying market conditions in Brazil, we have remained disciplined in our willingness to extend credit into the Brazilian market. We recognize this would reduce our revenue in the period, but the rising cost of hedging our local currency exposures, given the ongoing rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real and the preference of growers to delay their purchasing decision, led us to the conclusion that this is the right business decision for FMC.
All these factors taken together had a significant impact on FMC's revenues and segment earnings in the second quarter believe FMC in a position to deliver stronger earnings growth and cash generation through the second half of 2015 and beyond. Given the environment in which we're operating today, we're intensely focused on the cost structure of Ag Solutions. 
In May 2014, we initiated the series of program intended to reduce costs across the segment. This program, combined with early cost synergies from Cheminova integration, helped to partially offset lower volume in the quarter. We will continue to implement these cost-reduction programs while also driving the cost-saving benefits of the Cheminova transaction as quickly as possible. We believe these actions will deliver increasing cost-saving over the second half of 2015. Let me now provide you with an update on the Cheminova integration.
On Slide 3, we have provided additional detail regarding the synergies we discussed during our May 11 Investor Day. To remind you, we are targeting $120 million in synergies by the end of 2017. $90 million in synergies will come from cost-reduction, principally headcount, with $30 million in synergies coming from various commercial opportunities.
Immediately following the close of the Cheminova acquisition, we moved to begin integrating Cheminova and FMC. The integration is progressing well and gaining momentum, and the results achieved over the first 100 days reinforce our confidence in the ability of FMC Ag Solutions to deliver the targeted synergies of $120 million ahead of 2017.
Our first priority was to combine and integrate the commercial organization across key regions. In North America and Brazil and in other key countries in Latin America, we have already made changes to our sales organization and internal systems that allow us to approach the market as a single company. This was critical to deliver targeted synergies in the coming quarters, and I'm very pleased with the speed in which it was achieved.
We also initiated our plan to sell FMC products through Cheminova, which for the first time, will provide us with a direct market access across the majority of Europe for the 2016 season. As we integrate the commercial organization, we are also focused on reducing costs by streamlining the business and removing overlapping or redundant functions and capabilities. The majority of the near-term cost savings are driven by headcount reduction, and we expect more than 75% of all headcount actions to be taken by the end of this year. Further cost synergies are expected from a number of different non-head programs, including supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and closing surplus facilities. These specific synergies will begin to impact the result in 2016 and throughout 2017.
On Slide 4, we have summarized our progress to date to achieve the synergy target. We are targeting net headcount reductions of 500 [ph] position. Through the end of June, we have achieved approximately 65% of that target. As it relates to the other cost-reduction synergies, we have so far identified over 150 procurement project. And by the end of June, we have completed a quarter of them. We expect to identify and target additional procurement project in the future.
Turning next to commercial synergies. Sales and marketing organization has so far identified approximately 50 targeted growth programs, 60% of these programs have already been launched. Cost savings from our actions are coming in faster than initially planned, and we are pleased to see a number of recently launched commercial initiatives already gaining traction.
As a result, we now expect 2015 earnings to benefit from synergies of $30 million to $40 million, up from prior gains of $25 million to $30 million. The impact of these actions will be seen in the second half of 2015 and will serve as a catalyst for future earnings growth for FMC Ag Solutions.
As you might expect, we are finding many opportunities to realize additional synergies that we have not yet qualified. In the coming quarters, we will provide further updates on the progress to achieve our synergy targets and to the extent possible, quantify the additional synergy opportunities. Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5.
The segment's underlying performance in the quarter was good, although adverse currency movement led to flat revenue and segment earnings up by just 3% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 6% and segment earnings increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Prices remained stable across the portfolio. Sales were driven by continued volume growth in MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical and food end markets. Demand growth was strongest in the pharmaceutical industry, especially from multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India.
During the quarter, we were encouraged by increased demand for corridor MCC product in both Asia and North America. In China, demand for corridor MCC beverage applications remains below peak level. However, volumes are now consistent with this 2 prior to the steeple back in demand for corridor MCC products in Asia that we saw in the latter part of 2014.
Slightly offsetting these positive trends is continued weakness in nutraceutical products, specifically Omega-3. While sales volume trends have improved, we have yet to see a meaningful rebound in what would bring Omega-3 growth rate back to historical levels. We believe excess production capacity in the Omega-3 market will continue to be a headwind for prices at least for the foreseeable future.
The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continues to improve. We return to normal level of seaweed supply in our alginate operations during the quarter. And Manufacturing Excellence programs are delivering higher yields in our Norway facility. As a result, we remain confident that by the end of the year, we will be able to recover the earnings impact of the seaweed shortage through the first 4 months of 2015.
Now turning to Lithium on Slide 6. Reported revenue of $55 million decreased by 3% compared to last year and segment earnings of $5 million were 39% lower than the same quarter in 2014. Foreign currency, specifically the Argentine peso and the euro, continue to have a significant negative impact on Lithium reported results. Excluding impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 2% while segment earnings increased 17% compared to the prior quarter. 
The Lithium business continues to operate extremely well. During the second quarter, the business achieved record production rates at our carbonate operations in Argentina and at our IQ site plant in U.S. We continue to see improved pricing for both products on the back of strong demand growth.
The Lithium organization continues to focus on the Specialty segment in the market in particular, hydroxide high purity metals and butylithium. Given our technology strength and product expertise, as well as the market conditions for these segments, these are the areas where the greatest support increase for growth for FMC.
Turning to the outlook for Q3 and full year 2015. As we discussed, we remain cautious about the strength of the crop protection market compared to last year. The third quarter represents the start of the growing season in the Southern Hemisphere. And as a result, market condition in Brazil and Latin America will be the primary drivers of our performance in the third and fourth quarter. Given the difficult market conditions currently seen in Brazil, there are higher than normal levels of uncertainty as to when growers will make purchasing decision, which could impact the timing of sales between the third and fourth quarter.
While these will not change our expectations for the second half of the year, it does make it difficult to estimate the balance between Q3 and Q4. Despite this environment and continued unfavorable foreign currency movement, we expect very strong earnings performance over the next 6 months, driven by ongoing cost-saving initiatives, separation of cost and revenue synergies from Cheminova and targeted growth programs.
Once again, excellent progress to date on the integration on this cost the strategy and operational benefit of the Cheminova acquisition to FMC and increases our confidence in Ag Solutions' ability to deliver strong earnings growth during the second half 2015.
We expect full year Ag Solutions segment revenue to be within the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $510 million to $550 million. Over the next 6 months, we expect segment earnings of between $350 [ph] million to $340 million, an increase of approximately 40% compared to pro forma segment earnings in the second half of 2014. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $105 million to $125 million. Third quarter guidance is at wider range than in previous year, reflecting the higher than normal uncertainty in the crop protection market. However, this does not impact our outlook for the future.
In Health and Nutrition, we expect third quarter segment earnings to increase in the mid single-digit percent over 2014, driven by continued demand for MCC in both pharma and nutrition end markets. For the full year, we are anticipating segment revenue down low single-digit percent, but segment earnings growth in the mid- ingle-digit percent over 2014, supported by ongoing operational improvement and targeted restructuring program within this segment.
In Lithium, we continue to see strong demand and positive pricing trends for key products. As a result, we reiterate our expectation for third quarter segment earnings of $2 million to $4 million and full year segment earnings of $15 million to $25 million.
On a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3 and $3.3 [ph] per diluted share, a 3% decreased at the mid-point of the range compared to adjusted earnings per share for 2014.
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

So today, I'm going to focus on 2 main items. First, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC and second, an update on how we're doing dating on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from opera",1017,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. So today, I'm going to focus on 2 main items. First, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC and second, an update on how we're doing dating on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from operations.
Starting with FX. Ag Solutions was hardest hit by currency movements, and the 2 currencies that drove most of this impact was the Brazilian real, which depreciate against the dollar by more than 40% compared to Q2 last year and the euro, which depreciated by almost 20%. We were able to pass a proportional of this impact unto customers through higher prices. But the earnings impact of the shortfall between the price increases and the FX movements was still approximately $35 million.
This was largely due to the rate at which the currencies move as the local currency pricelist could not be amended quickly enough to keep pace with the exchange rate movements.
In Health and Nutrition, the movement of the euro was the largest single impact, although this reduced revenues more than operating earnings, given our relatively large euro or euro linked cost base. For Lithium, failure of the Argentine peso to depreciate at the same rate as local cost inflation was again the main driver, although the depreciation of the euro also contributed.
Included in these numbers are the hedging costs we incurred in our businesses, driven almost entirely by the cost of hedging Ag receivables in Brazil. As the base interest rate in Brazil have climbed in recent quarters, the cost hedge $1 of exposure has increased accordingly. Today, the cost of hedging has increased by 30% for dollar of exposure, generating almost $4 million of additional cost in Brazil alone for the second quarter and an expected full year increase of over $10 million. This hedging cost is included in our segment earnings as an operating expense.
Given the extreme volatility we see in the pre-IND than other currencies, we will continue tax our exposures in order to reduce the potential for large swings in our earnings. However, we will seek to decrease our total hedging cost by reducing wherever possible our real denominator sales, therefore, reducing the need to hedge. We have undertaken a program to identify products or customers, which at today's all-in costs, don't make economic sense to continue to serve on the same terms.
We do not expect this to result in a significant change to the way we conduct business in Brazil, but we will continue to exercise tighter discipline on what products we sell, to whom and on what terms. In fact, this is one of the factors that contributed to our decision to reduce sales of third-party products to our customers.
This brings me onto the second topic in cash generation. Slide 7 highlights some of the underlying contributors to our cash flow. As you can see, for the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations, which excludes all Cheminova one-off M&A and integration costs, was more than double last year at $189 million.
Perhaps moremost important, our segment operating cash flow, which we defined as the EBITDA, less or plus movements in working capital and before unallocated corporate costs, increased by 44% in the first half of the year, despite a year-on-year decrease in EBITDA over this period.
The driver of this improved cash generation is a decrease in the level of working capital in our businesses as a direct result of multiple programs initiated across FMC. Ag Solutions has focused on both inventory and receivables balances this year with programs designs to ensure we are not making or buying products for resale before they are needed and that we are not selling products sooner than we need to order or to customers that carry an unacceptable credit risk.
Health and Nutrition is also focused on its inventory, reducing levels by over 10% in the year as it uses ongoing Manufacturing Excellence programs to bring greater reliability to Manufacturing Operations, reducing the needs to carry excess inventory to meet customer needs.
Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding our cash flow performance. We are seeing traction in all of our major focus areas, and we will continue to focus on improving our cash flow performance in the coming quarters. We've also continued to be disciplined in overall capital spending, which in the first half of 2015, was 30% below the same period last year at $71 million. We expect total capital spending for this year to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million. 
Finally, a comment on our quarter ending net debt balance at just over $1.8 billion. I don't want anyone to get too excited by these numbers, as we have a significant tax payment related to the Alkali sale, which is not yet been made. This payment will be approximately $300 million over and above our ongoing tax payments and will be paid across the third and fourth quarters. The higher the normal cash balance we are carrying at quarter end is a function of these anticipated payments. Adjusting for this timing difference implies a net debt balance closer to $2.1 billion.
Before I hand the call back to Pierre, just a clarification of the increase in interest expense for Q2 and the rest of the year. We saw a temporary increase of approximately $5 million in the quarter, which was caused by certain local the facilities of Cheminova in India, Brazil and Argentina, which were incurring average annual interest rates in the mid-teens percent. Although these facilities were relatively small, they had a disproportionate impact on our interest expense in the quarter. The terms of those facilities, which reflect the non-investment-grade status of Cheminova, did not allow us to immediately replace them with a much lower cost to FMC borrowings. However, we have now replaced most of these facilities and will replace the remainder through the rest of 2015, bringing our interest expense as closer to more normal levels by the fourth quarter.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Our results for the second quarter were in line with our expectation. But for the unexpected temporary increase in tariff expense in the quarter, our results would have been at the top of our guidance range.
As for Ag Solutions business, we are highly focused on controlling what we can control. We are in a downcycle with currency challenges. We are actually more concerned that both currency situation than we are with the market, which exceed in line with our views as stated at our Investor Day in May.
The cycle will turn around as it always does, and FMC will be ready with a strong portfolio and a proven business model. In the meantime, we are very confident that our strategy is starting to pay off. Our focus is to deliver earnings growth via the synergies from Cheminova, including revenue synergies, and stringent cost control regardless of where we are in the Ag cycle, and this starting in the second half of 2015.
The integration of Cheminova is progressing faster than expected. Combined with our FMC portfolio and operated under the FMC business model, we will demonstrate in the coming quarters the potential of the new Ag Solutions business. We are also very confident that our earnings growth will accelerate rapidly into 2016.
Our Health and Nutrition portfolio continues to demonstrate its quality, specifically its Brazilians earnings profile. The cost control and Manufacturing Excellence program undertaken in 2015, combined with a technical strength and strong portfolio, will also see higher earnings growth as we enter 2016.
The Lithium business strategy to focus on downstream specialty product is now in place and the business continues to operate well. I am very pleased with the progress we're making in our reports to reduce capital invested in the business through tighter control of capital spending, multiple efforts focused on reducing our working capital and a very tight cost control. With the business environment that we're operating in today, it is extremely important that we continue to prioritize cash flow and capital discipline in all areas.

I know the numbers look big, but there is a solid logic behind those numbers. So if you think about year-on-year, what we've said is second half of 2015 will be about 40% up versus second half of 2014. Think about it that way. It's about $100 million of EBIT increase. 2 big buckets, the $100 million EBIT increase in the second half of 2015 versus 2014 is about 70, 7 0, $70 million of cost control and cost synergies. And then there is another bucket I would call of about $30 million of commercial benefit net of FX. So if I look at the commercial benefit, it's in a few categories. First, as you know, when we've been relying on it for many years now. We have a very strong herbicide portfolio, and we are seeing growth and market share gain in the herbicide portfolio. We are seeing, as I said in my script, weak synergies, specifically in Brazil and Latin America, on fungicide. There is some specific best pressure on cotton we are seeing in Brazil for which we will benefit. So all of those 3, we believe, will be bringing the growth. Now we believe that would be less a -- the impact of the lower insecticide demand for Latin America and mostly Brazil, and as I said before, less impact of FX. So think about that $70 million cost control, cost synergies. $30 million commercial benefit net of FX impact."

It is extremely difficult at any one of us down there, in my view, to individually change the terms in which we do business without having a significant and serious impact on the commercial operations down there. The most important factor that we're really focused on today is ensuring that we think very carefully about who we extend credit to, which products economically make sense to be sold on those terms. And that does change rapidly when you have interest rates of 15% and a real depreciating rapidly. And also, thinking about credit risk. We think very carefully about credit risk as you can imagine. So I don't think you will see a fundamental change in the terms of business. But I think discipline around who we sell to and when we sell to them is really the biggest tool that we have, and we've been very disciplined around that in the first half of the year.

In my comments, I will refer to the Q2 2015 earnings presentation posted on the FMC Investor Relations website. We have not used slides for previous earnings calls, but we have taken this approach today in order to help explain our results more clearly as we transition through 2015. I will refer to each slide by slide number as I go. 
The second quarter of 2015 was perhaps the most significant quarter in the long history of FMC Corporation. We completed the sale of the Alkali business to Tronox and closed the acquisition of Cheminova. These transactions mark the completion of the transformation of FMC's portfolio to one focused on the Ag, Health and Nutrition markets. 
Following the close of the Cheminova transaction, we moved quickly to integrate Cheminova into FMC Ag Solutions. During this quarter, we took multiple actions that will drive strong future performance of FMC and allow us to deliver target synergies of $120 million ahead of 2015. In particular, we successfully combined commercial organizations in key regions earlier than we had originally expected, which means we are well positioned to deliver the benefit of the acquisition more quickly than initially forecasted.
These recent changes, however, make it more difficult to compare the reported performance of Ag Solutions and Cheminova to their prior year's performance as standalone businesses, even just a few months after closing. Consequently, we will focus on comparing performance of Ag Solutions, including Cheminova, to the pro forma results for prior period. The full year 2014 pro forma results were filed with the SEC on June 5. Pro forma results for the second quarter are included in the schedule of this quarterly earnings release issued yesterday.
Before discussing FMC's earnings for the quarter, I will make a few general comments on 2 of the factors that have had a significant impact on FMC's reported results, the state of the global crop protection market and impact of foreign exchange movements.
The global crop protection market continues to face multiple headwinds that have created one of the most challenging operating environment of the past decade. Demand for crop protections product remains weak, due to the high-channel inventories, poor planting conditions, low pest pressures and soft agricultural community prices. Through the first 6 months of 2015, on a U.S. dollar basis, we estimate the global crop protection market was down by double-digit percent compared to the same period of 2014. Market conditions in Brazil are the most difficult. We estimate that through June, the crop protection market in Brazil was down approximately 25% compared to last year when measured in U.S. dollars.
Decline in demand reflected in lower volume are component by the rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real, which makes it harder for local currency price list to keep pace with exchange rate movement, resulting in lower revenues when converted into U.S. dollars. 
In addition to the real, all of our major currency exposures have weakened against the U.S. dollar, creating a significant headwind to reported revenue and earnings across each of our businesses. The negative impact of foreign exchange and the challenging crop protection market, particularly in Brazil, overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance across the FMC portfolio. During the call, I will highlight where unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations most impacted FMC's financial results. 
Turning to Slide 1. FMC reported $887 million in second quarter revenue, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit was $159 million for the second quarter, a 5% decrease compared to last year. And we reported $0.70 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 15% over the second quarter last year.
The benefits of ongoing cost reduction programs and synergies related to the integration of Cheminova, largely offset the impact of lower sales volume, higher interest expense and the higher tax rate in the quarter. However, price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset negative foreign currency fluctuation, which I will discuss in more detail in each segment.
Turning to Slide 2 in Ag Solutions. In order to provide greater clarity, as well as to be consistent with how FMC is currently operating the combined businesses, I will discuss segment performance on a pro forma basis, that is as though we owned Cheminova for the full quarter of 2014 and 2015. On this basis, revenue in the quarter was $684 million and segment earnings were $117 million, a decline of 23% and 30%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Foreign exchange had a significant negative impact on segment revenue and earnings in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, pro forma revenues declined 14%, while segment earnings increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2014.  
Multiple factors contributed to this performance. First, let me focus on the regional crop protection market and in particular, Brazil, the primary driver in the decline in sales volume compared to the second quarter of 2014. As I noted earlier, we believe the crop protection market in Brazil was down almost 25% through the first half of 2015. It is important to understand that this decline was not evenly spread across all product or crop segments. With respect to product segments, the volume decline was concentrated in insecticide.
We estimate that insecticides, which we would typically expect to account for more than 40% of the market through the first 6 months of the year, were down 50% over this period, reflecting weak insect pressures and high channel inventories. Offsetting this decline was a 16% increase in the fungicide market, making fungicide the largest crop protection category in the first 6 months of the year. This mix shift was dramatic and unlikely to persist through the remainder of 2015. However, it demonstrates how unusual the crop protection market in Brazil has been so far this year.
Historically, insecticides have contributed the largest product of FMC's revenue in Brazil for the first half of the year, while fungicide is a segment where FMC was historically underrepresented. The addition of Cheminova gives FMC a broader and more balanced product portfolio and enhances our future fungicide offerings.
In other countries, in Latin America, we observed encouraging demand growth, particularly for selective herbicides in Argentina and niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. North America delivered another solid quarter. Demand for FMC's authority brand herbicide was strong compared to the second quarter of 2014, driven by the continued increase in glyphosate-resistant acreage.
In Europe, volumes were stable compared to last year, driven mainly by Cheminova's sales in the region. We are very excited by the opportunities we see in Europe as we move to sell through Cheminova's direct access model in most of Europe for the 2016 season.
In Asia, we saw good results from newly launched product in China, specifically herbicides for wheat, and we saw further growth in Pakistan across the portfolio. Higher sales in these countries were partially offset by lower sales in Australia and Indonesia. Sales were also weaker in India, largely due to weak early monsoon season. 
Contributing to the decline in sales volume in the quarter were specific actions FMC took related to the way the new Ag Solutions segment we operate. First, we initiated a process to sell a Brazilian subsidiary, Consagro. This subsidiary is primarily a distributor of third-party product to smaller customers in Brazil. Given the opportunities the Cheminova portfolio brings, Consagro and its business model no longer fits with FMC. 
Second, we reduced our investments in certain FMC fungicide in Brazil, electing instead to shift our commercial focus to the fungicides portfolio acquired with Cheminova, which we believe will be better suited to the crops and the reals that FMC targets. Third, we continue to reduce the level of third-party sales across all region, in particular, reducing sales of lower margin products that are less valued by our customer.
Lastly, and very importantly, given the underlying market conditions in Brazil, we have remained disciplined in our willingness to extend credit into the Brazilian market. We recognize this would reduce our revenue in the period, but the rising cost of hedging our local currency exposures, given the ongoing rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real and the preference of growers to delay their purchasing decision, led us to the conclusion that this is the right business decision for FMC.
All these factors taken together had a significant impact on FMC's revenues and segment earnings in the second quarter, that leave FMC in a position to deliver stronger earnings growth and cash generation through the second half of 2015 and beyond. Given the environment in which we are operating today, we are intensely focused on the cost structure of Ag Solution. 
In May 2014, we initiated a series of program intended to reduce costs across the segment. This program, combined with early cost synergies from Cheminova integration, helped to partially offset lower volume in the quarter. We will continue to implement these cost-reduction programs, while also driving the cost-saving benefits of the Cheminova transaction as quickly as possible. We believe these actions will deliver increasing cost saving over the second half of 2015. 
Let me now provide you with an update on the Cheminova integration. On Slide 3, we have provided additional detail regarding the synergies we discussed during our May 11 Investor Day. To remind you, we are targeting $120 million in synergies by the end of 2017. $90 million in synergies will come from cost reduction, principally headcount, with $30 million in synergies coming from various commercial opportunities.
Immediately following the close of the Cheminova acquisition, we moved to begin integrating Cheminova and FMC. The integration is progressing well and gaining momentum, and the results achieved over the first 100 days reinforce our confidence in the ability of FMC Ag Solutions to deliver the targeted synergies of $120 million ahead of 2017.
Our first priority was to combine and integrate the commercial organization across key regions. In North America and Brazil and in other key countries in Latin America, we have already made changes to our sales organization and internal systems that allow us to approach the market as a single company. This was critical to deliver targeted synergies in the coming quarters, and I'm very pleased with the speed in which it was achieved.
We also initiated our plan to sell FMC products through Cheminova, which for the first time, will provide us with a direct market access across the majority of Europe for the 2016 season. As we integrate the commercial organization, we are also focused on reducing costs by streamlining the business and removing overlapping or redundant functions and capabilities. The majority of the near-term cost savings are driven by headcount reduction, and we expect more than 75% of all headcount actions to be taken by the end of this year. Further cost synergies are expected from a number of different non-head programs, including supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and closing surplus facilities. These specific synergies will begin to impact the result in 2016 and throughout 2017.
On Slide 4, we have summarized our progress to date to achieve the synergy targets. We are targeting net headcount reductions of 500 to 550 position. Through the end of June, we had achieved approximately 65% of that target. As it relates to the other cost-reduction synergies, we have so far identified over 150 procurement project. And by the end of June, we have completed a quarter of them. We expect to identify and target additional procurement project in the future.
Turning next to commercial synergies. Sales and marketing organization has so far identified approximately 50 targeted growth programs, 60% of these programs have already been launched. Cost savings from our actions are coming in faster than initially planned, and we are pleased to see a number of recently launched commercial initiatives already gaining traction.
As a result, we now expect 2015 earnings to benefit from synergies of $30 million to $40 million, up from prior gains of $25 million to $30 million. The impact of these actions will be seen in the second half of 2015 and will serve as a catalyst for future earnings growth for FMC Ag Solutions.
As you might expect, we are finding many opportunities to realize additional synergies that we have not yet qualified. In the coming quarters, we will provide further updates on the progress to achieve our synergy targets. And to the extent possible, quantify the additional synergy opportunities. 
Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. The segment's underlying performance in the quarter was good, although adverse currency movement led to flat revenue and segment earnings up by just 3% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 6% and segment earnings increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2014. 
Prices remained stable across the portfolio. Sales were driven by continued volume growth in MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical and food end markets. Demand growth was strongest in the pharmaceutical industry, especially from multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India.
During the quarter, we were encouraged by increased demand for colloidal MCC product in both Asia and North America. In China, demand for colloidal MCC beverage applications remains below peak level. However, volumes are now consistent with this historical averages prior to the steep pullback in demand for colloidal MCC product in Asia that we saw in the latter part of 2014.
Slightly offsetting these positive trend is continued weakness in nutraceutical products, specifically omega-3. While sales volume trends have improved, we have yet to see a meaningful rebound in what would bring omega-3 growth rate back to historical levels. We believe excess production capacity in the omega-3 market will continue to be a headwind for prices, at least, for the foreseeable future.
The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continues to improve. We return to normal level of seaweed supply in our alginate operations during the quarter. And Manufacturing Excellence programs are delivering higher yields in our Norway facility. As a result, we remain confident that by the end of the year, we will be able to recover the earnings impact of the seaweed shortage through the first 4 months of 2015.
Now turning to Lithium on Slide 6. Reported revenue of $55 million decreased by 3% compared to last year and segment earnings of $5 million were 39% lower than the same quarter in 2014. Foreign currency, specifically the Argentine peso and the euro, continue to have a significant negative impact on Lithium reported results. Excluding impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 2% while segment earnings increased 17% compared to the prior quarter. 
The Lithium business continues to operate extremely well. During the second quarter, the business achieved record production rates at our carbonate operations in Argentina and at our hydroxide plant in U.S. We continue to see improved pricing for both products on the back of strong demand growth.
The Lithium organization continues to focus on the Specialty segment in the market in particular, hydroxide, high purity metals and BuLi. Given our technology strength and product expertise, as well as the market conditions for these segments, these are the areas where the greatest support increase for growth for FMC.
Turning to the outlook for Q3 and full year 2015. As we discussed, we remain cautious about the strength of the crop protection market compared to last year. The third quarter represents the start of the growing season in the Southern Hemisphere. And as a result, market condition in Brazil and Latin America will be the primary drivers of our performance in the third and fourth quarter. Given the difficult market conditions currently seen in Brazil, there are higher than normal levels of uncertainty as to when growers will make purchasing decision, which could impact the timing of sales between the third and fourth quarter.
While these will not change our expectations for the second half of the year, it does make it difficult to estimate the balance between Q3 and Q4. Despite this environment and continued unfavorable foreign currency moves, we expect very strong earnings performance over the next 6 months, driven by ongoing cost-saving initiatives, acceleration of cost and revenue synergies from Cheminova and targeted growth programs.
Once again, excellent progress to date on the integration, underscores the strategic and operational benefit of the Cheminova acquisition to FMC and increases our confidence in Ag Solutions' ability to deliver strong earnings growth during the second half 2015.
We expect full year Ag Solutions segment revenue to be within the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $510 million to $550 million. Over the next 6 months, we expect segment earnings of between $350 million to $340 million, an increase of approximately 40% compared to pro forma segment earnings in the second half of 2014. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $105 million to $125 million. Third quarter guidance is a wider range than in previous year, reflecting the higher than normal uncertainty in the crop protection market. However, this does not impact our outlook for the future.
In Health and Nutrition, we expect third quarter segment earnings to increase in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014, driven by continued demand for MCC in both pharma and nutrition end markets. For the full year, we are anticipating segment revenue down low single-digit percent, but segment earnings growth in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014, supported by ongoing operational improvement and targeted restructuring program within the segments.
In Lithium, we continue to see strong demand and positive pricing trends for key products. As a result, we reiterate our expectation for third quarter segment earnings of $2 million to $4 million and full year segment earnings of $15 million to $25 million.
On a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3 and $3.3 per diluted share, a 3% decreased at the mid-point of the range compared to adjusted earnings per share for 2014.
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

So today, I'm going to focus on 2 main items. First, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC and second, an update on how we're doing on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from operations.",1019,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. So today, I'm going to focus on 2 main items. First, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC and second, an update on how we're doing on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from operations.
Starting with FX. Ag Solutions was hardest hit by currency movements, and the 2 currencies that drove most of this impact was the Brazilian real, which depreciate against the dollar by more than 40% compared to Q2 last year and the euro, which depreciated by almost 20%. We were able to pass a proportion of this impact unto customers through higher prices. But the earnings impact of the shortfall between the price increases and the FX movements was still approximately $35 million.
This was largely due to the rate at which the currencies moved, as the local currency price list could not be amended quickly enough to keep pace with the exchange rate movements.
In Health and Nutrition, the movement in the euro was the largest single impact, although this reduced revenues more than operating earnings, given our relatively large euro or euro linked cost base. For Lithium, failure of the Argentine peso to depreciate at the same rate as local cost inflation was again the main driver, although the depreciation of the euro also contributed.
Included in these numbers are the hedging costs we incurred in our businesses, driven almost entirely by the cost of hedging Ag receivables in Brazil. As the base interest rate in Brazil has climbed in recent quarters, the cost to hedge $1 of exposure has increased accordingly. Today, the cost of hedging has increased by 30% for dollar of exposure, generating almost $4 million of additional cost in Brazil alone for the second quarter, and an expected full year increase of over $10 million. This hedging cost is included in our segment earnings as an operating expense.
Given the extreme volatility we see in the real and indeed in other currencies, we will continue hedge our exposures in order to reduce the potential for large swings in our earnings. However, we will seek to decrease our total hedging cost by reducing wherever possible our real denominator sales, therefore, reducing the need to hedge. We have undertaken a program to identify products or customers, which at today's all-in costs, don't make economic sense to continue to serve on the same terms.
We do not expect this to result in a significant change to the way we conduct business in Brazil, but we will continue to exercise tighter discipline on what products we sell, to whom and on what terms. In fact, this is one of the factors that contributed to our decision to reduce sales of third-party products to our customers.
This brings me on to the second topic in cash generation. Slide 7 highlights some of the underlying contributors to our cash flow. As you can see, for the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations, which excludes all Cheminova one-off M&A and integration costs, was more than double last year at $189 million.
Perhaps most importantly, our segment operating cash flow, which we defined as the EBITDA less or plus movements in working capital and before unallocated corporate costs, increased by 44% in the first half of the year, despite a year-on-year decrease in EBITDA over this period.  
The driver of this improved cash generation is a decrease in the level of working capital in our businesses as a direct result of multiple programs initiated across FMC. Ag Solutions has focused on both inventory and receivables balances this year with programs designs to ensure we are not making or buying products for resale before they are needed and though we are not selling products sooner than we need to or to customers that carry an unacceptable credit risk.
Health and Nutrition is also focused on its inventory, reducing levels by over 10% in the year as it uses ongoing Manufacturing Excellence programs to bring greater reliability to Manufacturing Operations, reducing the needs to carry excess inventory to meet customer needs.
Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding our cash flow performance. We are seeing traction in all of our major focus areas, and we will continue to focus on improving our cash flow performance in the coming quarters. We've also continued to be disciplined in overall capital spending, which in the first half of 2015, was 30% below the same period last year at $71 million. We expect total capital spending for this year to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million. 
Finally, a comment on our quarter ending net debt balance of just over $1.8 billion. I don't want anyone to get too excited by these numbers, as we have a significant tax payment related to the Alkali sale, which has not yet been made. This payment will be approximately $300 million over and above our ongoing tax payments and will be paid across the third and fourth quarters. The higher the normal cash balance we are carrying at quarter end is a function of these anticipated payments. Adjusting for this timing difference implies a net debt balance closer to $2.1 billion.
Before I hand the call back to Pierre, just a clarification of the increase in interest expense for Q2 and the rest of the year. We saw a temporary increase of approximately $5 million in the quarter, which was caused by certain local debt facilities of Cheminova in India, Brazil and Argentina, which were incurring average annual interest rates in the mid-teens percent. Although these facilities were relatively small, they had a disproportionate impact on our interest expense in the quarter. The terms of those facilities, which reflect the non-investment-grade status of Cheminova, did not allow us to immediately replace them with much lower cost to FMC borrowings. However, we have now replaced most of these facilities and will replace the remainder through the rest of 2015, bringing our interest expense as closer to more normal levels by the fourth quarter.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Our results for the second quarter were in line with our expectation. But for the unexpected temporary increase in tariff expense in the quarter, our results would have been at the top of our guidance range.
As for Ag Solutions business, we are highly focused on controlling what we can control. We are in a down cycle with currency challenges. We are actually more concerned about currency fluctuations than we are with the market, which is still in line with our views as stated at our Investor Day in May.
The cycle will turn around as it always does, and FMC will be ready with a strong portfolio and a proven business model. In the meantime, we are very confident that our strategy is starting to pay off. Our focus is to deliver earnings growth via the synergies from Cheminova, including revenue synergies, and stringent cost control regardless of where we are in the Ag cycle, and this starting in the second half of 2015.
The integration of Cheminova is progressing faster than expected. Combined with our FMC portfolio and operated under the FMC business model, we will demonstrate in the coming quarters the potential of the new Ag Solutions business. We are also very confident that our earnings growth will accelerate rapidly into 2016.
Our Health and Nutrition portfolio continues to demonstrate its quality, specifically its resilient earnings profile. The cost control and Manufacturing Excellence program undertaken in 2015, combined with a technical strength and strong portfolio, will also see higher earnings growth as we enter 2016.
The Lithium business strategy to focus on downstream specialty product is now in place and the business continues to operate well. I am very pleased with the progress we are making in our efforts to reduce capital invested in the business through tighter control of capital spending, multiple efforts focused on reducing our working capital and a very tight cost control. With  the business environment that we're operating in today, it is extremely important that we continue to prioritize cash flow and capital discipline in all areas.

But Pierre, I wanted to just take a moment and -- the guidance for 2015 of $510 million to $550 million. At Investor Day, you outlined, I think, it was $635 million to $685 million which would be a 25% increase for 2016.

We believe, and we are still in the same pace, a vision for -- a view for the Ag market has not changed since Investor Day, which is it's going to be a rough second half of 2015. And 2016, we'll look at it as a bit senior as 2015. No down, no up, about the same. Within those condition, targeted growth on key technologies, products, revenue, synergies, plus cost synergy, should still bring us to the same level we had forecasted for 2016."

I",288,"Sure. Yes, thanks for the question because it's really an important second half for us because with the way we've been preparing the second half, with the acceleration of synergies in the second quarter, I think it's when things start to come together. I know the numbers look big, but there is a solid logic behind those numbers. So if you think about year-on-year, what we've said is second half of 2015 will be about 40% up versus second half of 2014. Think about it that way. It's about $100 million of EBIT increase. 2 big buckets, the $100 million EBIT increase in the second half of 2015 versus 2014 is about 70, 7-0, $70 million of cost control and cost synergies. And then there is another bucket I would call of about $30 million of commercial benefit net of FX. So if I look at the commercial benefit, it's in a few categories. First, as you know, and we've been relying on it for many years now. We have a very strong herbicides portfolio, and we are seeing growth and market share gain in the herbicide portfolio. We are seeing, as I said in my script, weak synergies, specifically in Brazil and Latin America, on fungicide. There is some specific best pressure on cotton we are seeing in Brazil which -- from which we will benefit. So all of those 3, we believe, will be bringing the growth. Now we believe that would be less a -- the impact of the lower insecticide demand for Latin America and mostly Brazil, and as I said before, less impact of FX. So think about that $70 million cost control, cost synergies. $30 million commercial benefit net of FX impact."

We see a very tough back end of 2015 and we see no improvement in 2016. Now looking at what is in the channels, all indication we have is we should start to see products being flushed out of the channel by the beginning of 2017. That's what we're expecting to see the cycle ending. Under that, the focus will be on revenue synergies, cost synergies and cost control. And the numbers, the one Frank mentioned are the one we still believe we could achieve. Today, where we are, we believe our view of the market is correct. That's what we're expecting. I can tell you that where we have the highest level of uncertainty and there isn't much we can do about it, these are on currency. I mean, the real is depreciating in incredible speed. We believe the euro has stabilized, still very hard to know what's going to happen with the -- in Argentina and what will happen with our currency. It could be positive.

So we wouldn't have suffered in quite the same way because our European business was so much smaller. They also have a sensible sized Brazilian business. So it's magnified the impact of those 2. So it's really those factors. It is really the extent of the exposure to those 2 major currencies has increased and those 2 currencies have depreciated significantly, as you know."

In my comments, I will refer to the Q2 2015 earnings presentation posted on the FMC Investor Relations website. We have not used slides for previous earnings calls, but we have taken this approach today in order to help explain our results more clearly as we transition through 2015. I will refer to each slide by slide number as I go. 
The second quarter of 2015 was perhaps the most significant quarter in the long history of FMC Corporation. We completed the sale of the Alkali business to Tronox and closed the acquisition of Cheminova. These transactions mark the completion of the transformation of FMC's portfolio to one focused on the Ag, Health and Nutrition markets. 
Following the close of the Cheminova transaction, we moved quickly to integrate Cheminova into FMC Ag Solutions. During this quarter, we took multiple actions that will drive strong future performance of FMC and allow us to deliver target synergies of $120 million ahead of 2015. In particular, we successfully combined commercial organizations in key regions earlier than we had originally expected, which means we are well positioned to deliver the benefit of the acquisition more quickly than initially forecasted.
These recent changes, however, make it more difficult to compare the reported performance of Ag Solutions and Cheminova to their prior year's performance as standalone businesses, even just a few months after closing. Consequently, we will focus on comparing performance of Ag Solutions, including Cheminova, to the pro forma results for prior period. The full year 2014 pro forma results were filed with the SEC on June 5. Pro forma results for the second quarter are included in the schedules of this quarterly earnings release issued yesterday.
Before discussing FMC's earnings for the quarter, I will make a few general comments on 2 of the factors that have had a significant impact on FMC's reported results, the state of the global crop protection market and impact of foreign exchange movements.
The global crop protection market continues to face multiple headwinds that have created one of the most challenging operating environment of the past decade. Demand for crop protections product remains weak, due to the high channel inventories, poor planting conditions, low pest pressures and soft agricultural community prices. Through the first 6 months of 2015, on a U.S. dollar basis, we estimate the global crop protection market was down by double-digit percent compared to the same period of 2014. Market conditions in Brazil are the most difficult. We estimate that through June, the crop protection market in Brazil was down approximately 25% compared to last year when measured in U.S. dollars.
Decline in demand reflected in lower volume are component by the rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real, which makes it harder for local currency price lists to keep pace with exchange rate movement, resulting in lower revenues when converted into U.S. dollars. 
In addition to the real, all of our major currency exposures have weakened against the U.S. dollar, creating a significant headwind to reported revenue and earnings across each of our businesses. The negative impact of foreign exchange and the challenging crop protection market, particularly in Brazil, overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance across the FMC portfolio. During the call, I will highlight where unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations most impacted FMC's financial results. 
Turning to Slide 1. FMC reported $887 million in second quarter revenue, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit was $159 million for the second quarter, a 5% decrease compared to last year. And we reported $0.70 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 15% over the second quarter last year.
The benefits of ongoing cost reduction programs and synergies related to the integration of Cheminova, largely offset the impact of lower sales volume, higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the quarter. However, price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset negative foreign currency fluctuation, which I will discuss in more detail in each segment.
Turning to Slide 2 and Ag Solutions. In order to provide greater clarity, as well as to be consistent with how FMC is currently operating the combined businesses, I will discuss segment performance on a pro forma basis, that is as though we owned Cheminova for the full quarter of 2014 and 2015. On this basis, revenue in the quarter was $684 million and segment earnings were $117 million, a decline of 23% and 30%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Foreign exchange had a significant negative impact on segment revenue and earnings in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, pro forma revenues declined 14%, while segment earnings increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2014.  
Multiple factors contributed to this performance. First, let me focus on the regional crop protection market and in particular, Brazil, the primary driver in the decline in sales volume compared to the second quarter of 2014. As I noted earlier, we believe the crop protection market in Brazil was down almost 25% through the first half of 2015. It is important to understand that this decline was not evenly spread across all product or crop segments. With respect to product segments, the volume decline was concentrated in insecticide.
We estimate that insecticides, which we would typically expect to account for more than 40% of the market through the first 6 months of the year, were down 50% over this period, reflecting weak insect pressures and high channel inventories. Offsetting this decline was a 16% increase in the fungicide market, making fungicide the largest crop protection category in the first 6 months of the year. This mix shift was dramatic and unlikely to persist through the remainder of 2015. However, it demonstrates how unusual the crop protection market in Brazil has been so far this year.
Historically, insecticides have contributed the largest product of FMC's revenue in Brazil for the first half of the year, while fungicide is a segment where FMC was historically underrepresented. The addition of Cheminova gives FMC a broader and more balanced product portfolio and enhances our future fungicide offerings.
In other countries, in Latin America, we observed encouraging demand growth, particularly for selective herbicides in Argentina and niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. North America delivered another solid quarter. Demand for FMC's Authority brand herbicide was strong compared to the second quarter of 2014, driven by the continued increase in glyphosate-resistant acreage.
In Europe, volumes were stable compared to last year, driven mainly by Cheminova's sales in the region. We are very excited by the opportunities we see in Europe as we move to sell through Cheminova's direct access model in most of Europe for the 2016 season.
In Asia, we saw good results from newly launched product in China, specifically herbicides for wheat, and we saw further growth in Pakistan across the portfolio. Higher sales in these countries were partially offset by lower sales in Australia and Indonesia. Sales were also weaker in India, largely due to weak early monsoon season. 
Contributing to the decline in sales volume in the quarter were specific actions FMC took related to the way the new Ag Solutions segment will operate. First, we initiated a process to sell a Brazilian subsidiary, Consagro. This subsidiary is primarily a distributor of third-party product to smaller customers in Brazil. Given the opportunities the Cheminova portfolio brings, Consagro and its business model no longer fits with FMC. 
Second, we reduced our investments in certain FMC fungicide in Brazil, electing instead to shift our commercial focus to the fungicides portfolio acquired with Cheminova, which we believe will be better suited to the crops and areas that FMC targets. Third, we continue to reduce the level of third-party sales across all region, in particular, reducing sales of lower margin products that are less valued by our customer.
Lastly, and very importantly, given the underlying market conditions in Brazil, we have remained disciplined in our willingness to extend credit into the Brazilian market. We recognize this would reduce our revenue in the period, but the rising cost of hedging our local currency exposures, given the ongoing rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real and the preference of growers to delay their purchasing decision, led us to the conclusion that this is the right business decision for FMC.
All these factors taken together had a significant impact on FMC's revenues and segment earnings in the second quarter, but leave FMC in a position to deliver stronger earnings growth and cash generation through the second half of 2015 and beyond. Given the environment in which we are operating today, we are intensely focused on the cost structure of Ag Solution. 
In May 2014, we initiated a series of program intended to reduce costs across the segment. This program, combined with early cost synergies from Cheminova integration, helped to partially offset lower volume in the quarter. We will continue to implement these cost-reduction programs, while also driving the cost-saving benefits of the Cheminova transaction as quickly as possible. We believe these actions will deliver increasing cost saving over the second half of 2015. 
Let me now provide you with an update on the Cheminova integration. On Slide 3, we have provided additional detail regarding the synergies we discussed during our May 11 Investor Day. To remind you, we are targeting $120 million in synergies by the end of 2017. $90 million in synergies will come from cost reduction, principally headcount, with $30 million in synergies coming from various commercial opportunities.
Immediately following the close of the Cheminova acquisition, we moved to begin integrating Cheminova and FMC. The integration is progressing well and gaining momentum, and the results achieved over the first 100 days reinforce our confidence in the ability of FMC Ag Solutions to deliver the targeted synergies of $120 million ahead of 2017.
Our first priority was to combine and integrate the commercial organization across key regions. In North America and Brazil and in other key countries in Latin America, we have already made changes to our sales organization and internal systems that allow us to approach the market as a single company. This was critical to deliver targeted synergies in the coming quarters, and I'm very pleased with the speed in which it was achieved.
We also initiated our plan to sell FMC products through Cheminova, which for the first time, will provide us with a direct market access across the majority of Europe for the 2016 season. As we integrate the commercial organization, we are also focused on reducing costs by streamlining the business and removing overlapping or redundant functions and capabilities. The majority of the near-term cost savings are driven by headcount reduction, and we expect more than 75% of all headcount actions to be taken by the end of this year. Further cost synergies are expected from a number of different non-head programs, including supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and closing surplus facilities. These specific synergies will begin to impact the result in 2016 and throughout 2017.
On Slide 4, we have summarized our progress to date to achieve the synergy targets. We are targeting net headcount reductions of 500 to 550 position. Through the end of June, we had achieved approximately 65% of that target. As it relates to the other cost-reduction synergies, we have so far identified over 150 procurement project. And by the end of June, we had completed a quarter of them. We expect to identify and target additional procurement project in the future.
Turning next to commercial synergies. Sales and marketing organization has so far identified approximately 50 targeted growth programs, 60% of these programs have already been launched. Cost savings from our actions are coming in faster than initially planned, and we are pleased to see a number of recently launched commercial initiatives already gaining traction.
As a result, we now expect 2015 earnings to benefit from synergies of $30 million to $40 million, up from prior guidance of $25 million to $30 million. The impact of these actions will be seen in the second half of 2015 and will serve as a catalyst for future earnings growth for FMC Ag Solutions.
As you might expect, we are finding many opportunities to realize additional synergies that we have not yet quantified. In the coming quarters, we will provide further updates on the progress to achieve our synergy targets. And to the extent possible, quantify the additional synergy opportunities. 
Moving on to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. The segment's underlying performance in the quarter was good, although adverse currency movement led to flat revenue and segment earnings up by just 3% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 6% and segment earnings increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2014. 
Prices remained stable across the portfolio. Sales were driven by continued volume growth in MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical and food end markets. Demand growth was strongest in the pharmaceutical industry, especially from multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India.
During the quarter, we were encouraged by increased demand for colloidal MCC product in both Asia and North America. In China, demand for colloidal MCC beverage applications remains below peak level. However, volumes are now consistent with historical averages prior to the steep pullback in demand for colloidal MCC product in Asia that we saw in the latter part of 2014.
Slightly offsetting these positive trends is continued weakness in nutraceutical products, specifically omega-3. While sales volume trends have improved, we have yet to see a meaningful rebound in what would bring omega-3 growth rate back to historical levels. We believe excess production capacity in the omega-3 market will continue to be a headwind for prices, at least, for the foreseeable future.
The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continues to improve. We returned to normal level of seaweed supply in our alginate operations during the quarter. And Manufacturing Excellence programs are delivering higher yields in our Norway facility. As a result, we remain confident that by the end of the year, we will be able to recover the earnings impact of the seaweed shortage through the first 4 months of 2015.
Now turning to Lithium on Slide 6. Reported revenue of $55 million decreased by 3% compared to last year and segment earnings of $5 million were 39% lower than the same quarter in 2014. Foreign currency, specifically the Argentine peso and the euro, continue to have a significant negative impact on Lithium reported results. Excluding impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 2% while segment earnings increased 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
The Lithium business continues to operate extremely well. During the second quarter, the business achieved record production rates at our carbonate operations in Argentina and at our hydroxide plant in U.S. We continue to see improved pricing for both products on the back of strong demand growth.
The Lithium organization continues to focus on the Specialty segment in the market, in particular: hydroxide, high purity metals and BuLi. Given our technology strength and product expertise, as well as the market conditions for these segments, these are the areas where the greatest opportunities for growth for FMC.
Turning to the outlook for Q3 and full year 2015. As we discussed, we remain cautious about the strength of the crop protection market compared to last year. The third quarter represents the start of the growing season in the Southern Hemisphere. And as a result, market condition in Brazil and Latin America will be the primary drivers of our performance in the third and fourth quarter. Given the difficult market conditions currently seen in Brazil, there are higher than normal levels of uncertainty as to when growers will make purchasing decision, which could impact the timing of sales between the third and fourth quarter.
While this will not change our expectations for the second half of the year, it does make it difficult to estimate the balance between Q3 and Q4. Despite this environment and continued unfavorable foreign currency moves, we expect very strong earnings performance over the next 6 months, driven by ongoing cost-saving initiatives, acceleration of cost and revenue synergies from Cheminova and targeted growth programs.
Once again, excellent progress to date on the integration underscores the strategic and operational benefit of the Cheminova acquisition to FMC and increases our confidence in Ag Solutions' ability to deliver strong earnings growth during the second half 2015.
We expect full year Ag Solutions segment revenue to be within the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $510 million to $550 million. Over the next 6 months, we expect segment earnings of between $350 million to $340 million, an increase of approximately 40% compared to pro forma segment earnings in the second half of 2014. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $105 million to $125 million. Third quarter guidance is a wider range than in previous year, reflecting the higher than normal uncertainty in the crop protection market. However, this does not impact our outlook for the future.
In Health and Nutrition, we expect third quarter segment earnings to increase in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014, driven by continued demand for MCC in both pharma and nutrition end markets. For the full year, we are anticipating segment revenue down low single-digit percent, but segment earnings growth in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014, supported by ongoing operational improvement and targeted restructuring program within the segments.
In Lithium, we continue to see strong demand and positive pricing trends for key products. As a result, we reiterate our expectation for third quarter segment earnings of $2 million to $4 million and full year segment earnings of $15 million to $25 million.
On a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3 and $3.3 per diluted share, a 3% decreased at the mid-point of the range compared to adjusted earnings per share for 2014.
I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights."

So today, I'm going to focus on 2 main items. First, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC and second, an update on how we're doing on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from operations.
Starting with FX. Ag Solutions was hardest hit by currency movements, and the 2 currencies that drove most of this impact were the Brazilian real, which depreciated against the dollar by more than 40% compared to Q2 last year, and the euro, which depreciated by almost 20%. We were able to pass a proportion of this impact unto customers through higher prices. But the earnings impact of the shortfall between the price increases and the FX movements was still approximately $35 million.
This was largely due to the rate at which the currencies moved, as the local currency price lists could not be amended quickly enough to keep pace with the exchange rate movements.
In Health and Nutrition, the movement in the euro was the largest single impact, although this reduced revenues more than operating earnings, given our relatively large euro or euro-linked cost base. For Lithium, failure of the Argentine peso to depreciate at the same rate as local cost inflation was again the main driver, although the depreciation of the euro also contributed.
Included in these numbers are the hedging costs we incur in our businesses, driven almost entirely by the cost of hedging Ag receivables in Brazil. As the base interest rate in Brazil has climbed in recent quarters, the cost to hedge $1 of exposure has increased accordingly. Today, the cost of hedging has increased by 30% per dollar of exposure, generating almost $4 million of additional cost in Brazil alone for the second quarter, and an expected full year increase of over $10 million. This hedging cost is included in our segment earnings as an operating expense.
Given the extreme volatility we see in the real and indeed in other currencies, we will continue hedge our exposures in order to reduce the potential for large swings in our earnings. However, we will seek to decrease our total hedging cost by reducing wherever possible our real denominator sales, therefore, reducing the need to hedge. We have undertaken a program to identify products or customers, which at today's all-in costs, don't make economic sense to continue to serve on the same terms.
We do not expect this to result in a significant change to the way we conduct business in Brazil, but we will continue to exercise tighter discipline on what products we sell, to whom and on what terms. In fact, this is one of the factors that contributed to our decision to reduce sales of third-party products to our customers.
This brings me on to the second topic in cash generation. Slide 7 highlights some of the underlying contributors to our cash flow. As you can see, for the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations, which excludes all Cheminova one-off M&A and integration costs, was more than double last year at $189 million.
Perhaps most importantly, our segment operating cash flow, which we define as EBITDA less or plus movements in working capital and before unallocated corporate costs, increased by 44% in the first half of the year, despite a year-on-year decrease in EBITDA over this period.  
The driver of this improved cash generation is a decrease in the level of working capital in our businesses as a direct result of multiple programs initiated across FMC. Ag Solutions has focused on both inventory and receivables balances this year with programs designed to ensure we are not making or buying products for resale before they are needed and that we are not selling products sooner than we need to or to customers that carry an unacceptable credit risk.
Health and Nutrition is also focused on its inventory, reducing levels by over 10% in the year as it uses ongoing Manufacturing Excellence programs to bring greater reliability to Manufacturing Operations, reducing the need to carry excess inventory to meet customer needs.
Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding our cash flow performance. We are seeing traction in all of our major focus areas, and we will continue to focus on improving our cash flow performance in the coming quarters. We've also continued to be disciplined in overall capital spending, which in the first half of 2015, was 30% below the same period last year at $71 million. We expect total capital spending for this year to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million. 
Finally, a comment on our quarter ending net debt balance of just over $1.8 billion. I don't want anyone to get too excited by this numbers, as we have a significant tax payment related to the Alkali sale, which has not yet been made. This payment will be approximately $300 million over and above our ongoing tax payments and will be paid across the third and fourth quarters. The higher than normal cash balance we are carrying at quarter end is a function of these anticipated payments. Adjusting for this timing difference implies a net debt balance closer to $2.1 billion.
Before I hand the call back to Pierre, just a clarification of the increase in interest expense for Q2 and the rest of the year. We saw a temporary increase of approximately $5 million in the quarter, which was caused by certain local debt facilities of Cheminova in India, Brazil and Argentina, which were incurring average annual interest rates in the mid-teens percent. Although these facilities were relatively small, they had a disproportionate impact on our interest expense in the quarter. The terms of those facilities, which reflect the non-investment-grade status of Cheminova, did not allow us to immediately replace them with much lower cost to FMC borrowings. However, we have now replaced most of these facilities and will replace the remainder through the rest of 2015, bringing our interest expenses closer to more normal levels by the fourth quarter.
With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre."

Our results for the second quarter were in line with our expectation. But for the unexpected temporary increase in tariff expense in the quarter, our results would have been at the top of our guidance range.
As for Ag Solutions business, we are highly focused on controlling what we can control. We are in a down cycle with currency challenges. We are actually more concerned about currency fluctuations than we are with the market, which is still in line with our views as stated at our Investor Day in May.
The cycle will turn around as it always does, and FMC will be ready with a strong portfolio and a proven business model. In the meantime, we are very confident that our strategy is starting to pay off. Our focus is to deliver earnings growth via the synergies from Cheminova, including revenue synergies, and stringent cost control regardless of where we are in the Ag cycle, and this starting in the second half of 2015.
The integration of Cheminova is progressing faster than expected. Combined with our FMC portfolio and operated under the FMC business model, we will demonstrate in the coming quarters the potential of the new Ag Solutions business. We are also very confident that our earnings growth will accelerate rapidly into 2016.
Our Health and Nutrition portfolio continues to demonstrate its quality, specifically its resilient earnings profile. The cost control and Manufacturing Excellence programs undertaken in 2015, combined with a technical strength and strong portfolio, will also see higher earnings growth as we enter 2016.
The Lithium business strategy to focus on downstream specialty product is now in place and the business continues to operate well. I am very pleased with the progress we are making in our efforts to reduce capital invested in the business through tighter control of capital spending, multiple efforts focused on reducing our working capital and very tight cost control. With the business environment that we're operating in today, it is extremely important that we continue to prioritize cash flow and capital discipline in all areas.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

But Pierre, I wanted to just take a moment and -- the guidance for 2015 of $510 million to $550 million. At Investor Day, you outlined, I think, it was $635 million to $685 million, which would be a 25% increase for 2016.

We are not banking on any change in the Ag cycle for next year. We believe, and we are still in the same pace, a vision for -- a view for the Ag market has not changed since Investor Day, which is it's going to be a rough second half of 2015. And 2016, we'll look at it as a bit similar as 2015. No down, no up, about the same. Within those condition, targeted growth on key technologies, products, revenue, synergies, plus cost synergy, should still bring us to the same level we had forecasted for 2016."

Yes, thanks for the question because it's really an important second half for us because with the way we've been preparing the second half, with the acceleration of synergies in the second quarter, I think it's when things start to come together. I know the numbers look big, but there is a solid logic behind those numbers. So if you think about year-on-year, what we've said is second half of 2015 will be about 40% up versus second half of 2014. Think about it that way. It's about $100 million of EBIT increase. 2 big buckets, the $100 million EBIT increase in the second half of 2015 versus 2014 is about 70, 7-0, $70 million of cost control and cost synergies. And then there is another bucket I would call of about $30 million of commercial benefit net of FX. So if I look at the commercial benefit, it's in a few categories. First, as you know, and we've been relying on it for many years now. We have a very strong herbicide portfolio, and we are seeing growth and market share gain in the herbicide portfolio. We are seeing, as I said in my script, quick synergies, specifically in Brazil and Latin America, on fungicide. There is some specific pest pressure on cotton we are seeing in Brazil which -- from which we will benefit. So all of those 3, we believe, will be bringing the growth. Now we believe that would be less the impact of the lower insecticide demand for Latin America and mostly Brazil, and as I said before, less the impact of FX. So think about that $70 million cost control, cost synergies. $30 million commercial benefit net of FX impact."

We see a very tough back end of 2015 and we see no improvement in 2016. Now looking at what is in the channels, all indication we have is we should start to see products being flushed out of the channel by the beginning of 2017. That's what we're expecting to see the cycle ending. Under that, the focus will be on revenue synergies, cost synergies and cost control. And the numbers, the one Frank mentioned, are the one we still believe we could achieve. Today, where we are, we believe our view of the market is correct. That's what we're expecting. I can tell you that where we have the highest level of uncertainty and there isn't much we can do about it, it's around currency. I mean, the real is depreciating at an incredible speed. We believe the euro has stabilized, still very hard to know what's going to happen with the -- in Argentina and what will happen with our currency. It could be positive. So that's where we have the highest uncertainties. So right now, the scenario we have is about the same as the one we were outlining in Investor Day, potentially with how the currency situation, which could be balanced by faster synergies coming into 2016."

We've done, as you can imagine, an enormous amount of the work and spent a lot of time focused on this. We -- the whole industry operates on exactly the same terms. It is extremely difficult for any one of us down there, in my view, to individually change the terms on which we do business without having a significant and serious impact on the commercial operations down there. The most important factor that we're really focused on today is ensuring that we think very carefully about who we extend credit to, which products economically make sense to be sold on those terms. And that does change rapidly when you have interest rates of 15% and a real depreciating rapidly. And also, thinking about credit risk. We think very carefully about credit risk as you can imagine. And so I don't think you will see a fundamental change in the terms of business. But I think discipline around who we sell to and when we sell to them is really the biggest tool that we have, and we've been very disciplined around that in the first half of the year. I think we'll continue to be disciplined, and our outlook assumes that discipline continues through the rest of the year."

We can only hedge at the prevailing rate and the prevailing rate itself has moved year-on-year. And so ultimately, without price movements on our real price list, we're always going to have that headwind simply because the forward rates, as well as the spot rates, are significantly different. So our hedging policy has not changed, the extent to which we hedge has not changed. The cost of that hedging has increased. So a significant portion in the quarter, I think it's around $4 million, increase year-on-year of hedging costs as a result of the real. A second factor is bringing in Cheminova. Cheminova has a big European business. And so we have a big euro exposure compared to last year that we historically would not have had. So we wouldn't have suffered in quite the same way because our European business was so much smaller. They also have a sensible sized Brazilian business. So it's magnified the impact of those 2. So it's really those factors. It is really the extent of the exposure to those 2 major currencies has increased and those 2 currencies have depreciated significantly, as you know."

As with the last quarter, we had published a slide presentation that accompanies our results and I will refer to these slides as I discuss our results and outlook for the rest of the year. 
The third quarter of 2015 was marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds, the effect of which were most pronounced in our results for Agricultural Solutions. However, excluding the impact of foreign currencies, the Ag solution business performed in line with expectations, confirming the strength of FMC's portfolio and technology in a weak global local market. 
Health and Nutrition delivered another solid quarter, continuing to benefit from commercial and operating initiatives implemented over the past 12 months. Lithium continued to see strong demand for its specialty products, including lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity metals.
You will see from our comments today that despite difficult market condition, each of our businesses is performing well with a notable exception of the Brazil Ag business. As I will discuss during the call, we are executing a comprehensive program to protect the profitability of our business in Brazil in the current market environment and position the business to deliver earnings growth and higher returns in 2016 and 2017.
Turning now to Slide 1. FMC reported $831 million in revenue in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 1.5% compared to the same period last year.
Adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $95 million, a 37% decrease compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.42, which was $0.42 below the third quarter of 2014.
Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was higher than our earlier guidance due to lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in more detail shortly.
The significant movement in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, especially in the real and the euro, was the main driver of the decline in FMC's earnings compared to the third quarter of 2014, as price increases in local currency were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency devaluation on our reported results. In the third quarter alone, foreign exchange reduced FMC's reported adjusted operating profit by over $110 million.
I will review the impact of FX in more detail when discussing the performance of each business. 
First, Ag solutions on Slide 2. Ag solutions delivered revenue of $578 million and segment earnings of $59 million in the quarter, a decline of 32% and 49%, respectively, from the pro forma results in the same period of 2014. Price increases and cost reductions only partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volumes.
As noted in our October 12 press release, the rapid devaluation of the Brazilian real created significant headwinds for our business. During the third quarter of 2015 alone, the Brazilian real depreciated over 25% versus the U.S. dollar, reducing segment earnings by over $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2013.
While we were successful in implementing significant price increases during the quarter in Brazil, these price increases only offset about half of the currency impact. 
Following the acquisition of Cheminova, FMC initiated the program to rationalize our global product offering and increase our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. This portfolio rationalization, which was accelerated during the third quarter, reduced revenue in Brazil by approximately $120 million compared to the third quarter of 2014.
Excluding these actions, sales volumes in Brazil declined only modestly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as demand in Brazil for FMC's differentiated products remained strong.
We saw continued volume growth in FMC proprietary product offerings, including sales of insecticides, cotton, fungicides for soybean and herbicides for sugarcane.
In other countries in Latin America, we continued to see strong demand for FMC's product, including selective herbicides in Argentina and products for nonrow crop in Colombia and Mexico. Argentina remains an attractive market for FMC, however, obtaining import licenses for formulated products remain a challenge in the short term, reducing our ability to fully take advantage of strong demand for our product in the country.
Outside Latin America, revenues declined mainly as a result of unfavorable currency effect, particularly the euro and lower volumes, largely as a result of weather, weakness pressure or excess channel inventories. Due to our focus on cost control globally, earnings outside of Latin America were essentially flat with the same period in 2014.
In the face of continued difficult market conditions, FMC aggressively reduced operating cost in the quarter. The cost savings achieved to date will continue to increase throughout Q4 as we accelerate the integration of Cheminova and execute the restructuring of our Ag solutions operations in Brazil, which I will now discuss on Slide 3. 
Through September, we estimate sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil have done approximately 18% in U.S. dollar terms. For the full year, we estimate the market of crop protection chemicals in Brazil will be down mid to high teens percent compared to 2014. 
Despite the significant decline in sales across the industry in Brazil, there is healthy demand for growers -- from growers for technically differentiated, higher-value in use product to address specific pest and weed pressures. 
The acquisition of Cheminova has allowed FMC to rationalize its products offering and refocus the combined business in Brazil on FMC's and Cheminova's proprietary technology platform.
We firmly believe these actions will position FMC to deliver high growth and higher returns in Latin America in 2016 and beyond.
Let me qualify for you the impact of these actions on our 2015 revenue. Pro forma for Cheminova Ag solution revenue in Brazil was approximately $1.2 billion in 2014.
In 2015, FMC will eliminate some $250 [ph] million of low-margin third-party product sales. These includes action taken for the first 6 months of the year, such as the previously announced sale of our generic subsidiary Consagro, as well as action taken in the second half of this year.
Excluding this portfolio rationalization, FMC's sales volume in Brazil are expected to be down slightly compared to 2014 reflecting current market conditions. As I discussed earlier, foreign exchange will have a significant negative impact on our reported results for the year. Assuming stability in the current U.S. dollars, Brazilian real exchange rates through the end of the year, we expect price increases to recover about [ph] 40% of full year impact of foreign currency.
Taking these impacts into account, revenue in Brazil is expected to be about $750 [ph] million in 2015.
The successful execution of the ongoing portfolio rationalization will have 3 very important implications for FMC. First, it will enable the business to eliminate additional operating cost, which will protect the profitability of the business during this downturn and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery. As I will discuss shortly, there is all these actions currently underway, we expect to realize the meaningful reduction in operating cost in both 2016 and 2017.
Second, these actions will allow us to generate higher operating margin and return in Brazil. We will eliminate sales of our lowest margin product and further enhance our focus on FMC's core technical portfolio in Brazil, including higher margins of entrozone, clomazone and malathione proprietary formulation. We will take this opportunity to reduce the capital employed in the business leading to higher returns in capital, lower hedging and financing costs and stronger cash generation.
Third, the steps we have taken to reduce FMC's revenue base in Brazil, combined with a larger revenue base in all other region pro forma for Cheminova, will result in greater geographic balance over Ag solutions business. As you can see in the chart on the right side of the slide, Latin America accounted for more than 50% [ph] of the Ag solutions sales in 2014. 
In 2015, on a pro forma basis and including the actions I just described, sales in Latin America will account for just over 40% of Ag solutions revenue. Brazil itself will account for less than 30% of Ag solutions pro forma revenue in 2015 compared to over [ph] 40% in 2014.
Equally important, revenue distribution for North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific is much more balanced. The mixed shift in our regional mix will also contribution to higher overall segment earnings moving into 2016 as our 2 highest margin regions, North America and Europe, will contribute over 40% of Ag solutions revenue.
As you can see on Slide 4, the original cost-reduction target announced as part of Cheminova synergies was $90 [ph] million. As a result of the actions we are taking in Brazil and with the reduction in certain corporate function, we expect global run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million. To be clear, this target is inclusive of the $90 [ph] million in synergies related to the integration of Cheminova, which we have discussed at length before today.
Headcount reductions will be the single largest contributor to the incremental cost savings. FMC is now targeting total reduction of 800 to 850 positions. This compares to the 500 to 550 position announced previously. The majority of the additional headcount reduction will be in our Brazil operations. We are moving quickly to realize these cost savings and the majority of these actions needed to deliver these savings will be implemented in the next 6 months.
We expect to realize approximately $35 million to $40 million in cost savings in 2015. This savings principally related to previously announced actions to integrate Cheminova into FMC.
The additional benefit from the further cost reduction program will be realized through 2016 and the first half of 2017. And we expect to deliver additional cost savings of between $50 [ph] million to $70 [ph] million in 2016. 
The success we have achieved to date in delivering the prior synergy targets and the pace at which we have commenced the most recent cost-reduction program give us a high degree of confidence that we'll deliver the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost saving by the middle of 2017.
Let me now turn to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. Q3 was another strong quarter for FMC Health and Nutrition. Reported revenue declined 3% compared to the third quarter of 2014 as foreign exchange headwinds offset favorable volume and improved mix in the quarter. Excluding currency, revenue increased by 2% [ph] compared to Q3 [ph] 2014. Segment earnings increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014 to $47 million in the quarter. 
The business still continued strong volumes and realized improved mix in the quarter. The increase in sales volume was due to continued demand for growth for FMC's MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical market, especially for multinational companies in Europe, engineering producers in India and for full applications in both Asia and North America.
The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continued to benefit from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Segment's operating margins in the quarter increased 250 basis points over last year to 24%. We are pleased with the performance of the business to date and believe Health and Nutrition is well-positioned to deliver continued earnings growth and higher returns going forward. 
Turning to lithium next on Slide 6. Reported revenue of $57 million decreased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Segment earnings of $1.8 [ph] million were $3.5 million lower than the same quarter last year. 
We continued to see increased demand for FMC's downstream specialty product, however, sales volume were down 13% compared to third quarter of 2014 due to lower third-party component supply and the timing of a scheduled maintenance outage at our lithium hydroxide unit in City. In 2015, we entered into a new agreement for a third-party to supply lithium carbonate to FMC. Volume under this agreement will increase as we move through Q4 and will help feed our specialty businesses. 
Operating performance continues to improve. Our facility in Argentina continues to operate in record production rate. However, continued strong operating performance was not self-sufficient to have said impact of lower sales volume and foreign currency.
Last night, we published our outlook statements for the fourth quarter of 2015. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments on Slide 7.
We expect most of the headwinds that impacted Q3 results for Ag solutions to persist through the end of the year. However, as we discussed on our second quarter call, a significant portion of the 2015 cost savings associated with integration of Cheminova will be realized in the fourth quarter. These cost savings, combined with additional price increases and ongoing portfolio rationalization will largely offset the FX headwinds there are facing in Latin America.
Outside of Latin America, we expect the business to be flat to 2014. As a result, we estimate Ag solutions segment earnings to be in the range of $110 million to $130 [ph] million for Q4. 
For Health and Nutrition, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million driven by continued demand for Health and Nutrition's MCC product line and lower operating costs as a result of ongoing Manufacturing Excellence program.
For lithium, fourth [ph] quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million. We continue to see strong demand for our specialty products and expect sequentially higher carbonate and hydroxide volumes as well as higher ceiling prices. As I previously announced, price increases are beginning to take effect. While inflationary headwinds in Argentina are likely to continue, we expect they will be offset by lower manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter.
After corporate costs, which we estimate to be around $20 million in Q4, adjusted EBIT will be between $140 [ph] million and $160 [ph] million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014 at the midpoint of the range.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me spend a few minutes discussing the outlook for 2016.
While it is premature to give full year guidance, I do want to highlight some of the factors that will impact our 2016 performance. In Ag solutions, there are a number of factors which are largely in our control that will favorably impact 2016 segment earnings. These include the previously described incremental cost savings, a full year of earnings contribution from Cheminova and lower operating cost in Brazil due to the benefits of a weaker real. We have a high degree of confidence in the impact of these 3 items, which combined are expected to contribution north of $75 million to segment earnings in 2016.
However, external factors, most of the market demand and currency will have an impact on our reported results. We do not expect any improvement in market conditions in 2016. In fact, based on what we see today, we expect global market demand for crop protection chemicals to be down next year.
The extent of the decline will essentially depend on the level of challenges not only in Brazil, but also North America and Europe, assuming normal weather and pressures.
While foreign currency headwinds appear to have moderated so far in Q4, macroeconomic and geopolitical events impacting foreign exchange rates in each of our key geographic regions continue to evolve. Assuming stability in foreign exchange rate in Brazil, we believe there will be opportunities to continue to recover pricing in that market, however, it will be difficult to qualify the benefit of any future price increases until we are well into 2016 and the next selling season in Brazil.
We expect Health and Nutrition to deliver another year of solid earnings growth driven by higher volume and an improved cost position. In particular, we see continued strong demand for FMC's MCC portfolio across both the Health and Nutrition market. 
As we have discussed throughout the year, Health and Nutrition have successfully reduced its operating costs as a result of the ongoing implementation of manufacturing excellence initiatives across the business. These efforts will continue into next year and deliver incremental cost savings in 2016. Foreign currency, principally the euro, has negatively impacted the reported results in the recent quarters. However, the potential impacts of foreign exchange aside, we currently expect Health and Nutrition to deliver segment earnings growth of $10 million to $15 million in 2016.
In our Lithium business, we expect to realize higher selling prices and continued mix improvements from our focus in specialty products, as well as the full year benefit of lower operating cost in 2016, which we estimate could increase segment earnings by approximately $10 million.
We will enter 2016 with a strong pricing environment with lithium products. In September, our Lithium business announced price increases on all product lines. The majority of this price increases will be realized throughout 2016. Product mix will benefit from the third-party supply of lithium carbonate. This supply will supplement our own lithium carbonate production and feed our specialty businesses. In addition, we will realize the full year benefit from ongoing process improvement programs as well as the new natural gas pipeline, which began operation late in the third quarter this year. 
Inflation in Argentina has been a significant drag on lithium earnings over the past few years. While the election of a new president in Argentina may bring a change in monetary policy and eventual devaluation of the Argentina -- Argentine peso, such actions are difficult to predict and may take time to unfold. 
Unallocated corporate costs are expected to decline by $15 million to $20 million, reflecting the benefit of the cost reduction actions discussed earlier. 
As you can see, there are a number of factors within our control that we believe will deliver earnings growth in each of our business in 2016.
During FMC's Q4 2015 earnings call in February, we will provide more detailed guidance for the coming year. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

Before I discuss cash flow on Slide 9, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax reporting this quarter. As the schedule to our press release explain, our adjusted tax rate is embedded with the underlying tax rate related",885,"Thanks, Pierre. Before I discuss cash flow on Slide 9, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax reporting this quarter. 
As the schedule to our press release explain, our adjusted tax rate is embedded with the underlying tax rate related to business operations. We have always looked to remove those items that are unrelated to the businesses and presenting our taxi. However one item that has been causing increased unpredictability in our reported rate is related to the currency movements. For us historically, that has meant the Argentine peso, the Norwegian kroner and of course, the Brazilian real. Simply put, we finance and operate our businesses in these countries in a currency that is different than the local currency, but are forced to remeasure certain financial assets and liabilities into local currencies for U.S. GAAP tax purposes. This remeasurement creates adjustments to our U.S. GAAP tax rate without any corresponding impact on our profits before tax. 
Historically, these items have been small and have not had a material impact on our reported tax rate. However, movements in the euro last year and the Brazilian real this year have created larger distortions to our tax rate than we had ever seen previously.
To put this into context, if we have not made this change in the presentation, our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter 2015 would have been negative. Clearly, this would not have been a reflection of our true adjusted tax rate associated with our underlying business and would not have helped any of you understand our business performance any better.
Looking forward, and with expectations of larger movements in the Argentine peso and continued volatility in the Brazilian real, we do not expect this issue to go away. Consequently, we have decided to present our tax rates such that it excludes these discrete remeasurement items. We have recalculated our tax rate under this method for each of the last 6 quarters and included the revised adjusted net income in our press release schedules. 
Let me now move cash flow performance on Slide 9. As you know in the current environment, we have placed a significant focus on cash generation. We appreciate that the combined effects of acquisition of Cheminova, the sale of Alkali and foreign currency movements make it more difficult to extract underlying cash performance from our financial statements this year, so I will now walk you through the major components. 
Through the first 9 months of 2015, our EBITDA is almost $100 million less than the same period last year. Despite this, when you look at operating cash flow generated from continuing operations, you can see that FMC generated double the cash flow in 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Part of this improvement can be attributed to lower cash outlays in areas such as capital expenditure and taxes, allowing us to fully offset the temporarily higher interest expense and pension payments. We will continue to be very disciplined in capital spending and look to further optimize our tax position as we take advantage of the opportunities presented to us by Cheminova's footprint.
However, the bulk of the improved operating cash flow performance has come from working capital. So for this year, total cash released from working capital across all 3 segments is approximately $75 million, the majority of which has been from Ag solutions. While still well below what we are looking to achieve, it represents an improvement over the same period last year of over $300 million, a period when working capital continued to consume cash. 
This improvement can be largely tracked to lower levels of receivables and inventory. Ag solutions has generated cash from receivables in all 3 quarters of 2015, something it only achieved in 1 quarter last year. And in 2 of the 3 quarters so far this year, it has seen a reduction in inventory compared to last year when inventory actually increased in each of the first three quarters.
We continue to focus on these 2 largest drivers of working capital and expect to see the year-on-year improvement and performance continue into the fourth quarter. We expect Ag solutions to generate a modest positive cash flow from working capital as higher receivables largely offset by reduced inventory levels. Taken together, we forecast that our cash generated from working capital at 2015 will be almost $350 million better than 2014, which will more than offset the decline in EBITDA over the same period.
This focus on cash flow is reflected in our strengthening balance sheet. Our corporate end net debt was just under $2 billion, slightly better than our prior forecast. Our debt consists almost entirely of medium and long-term maturities with our only short term maturities, namely commercial paper balances, largely covered by cash on hand. Approximately 50% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate debt.
We are expecting net debt to remain broadly flat at year-end. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio currently sits at just above 3x, largely due to the lower-than-expected EBITDA. As our EBITDA improves and we continue to generate cash from working capital and exercise discipline in all areas of spending, we expect this ratio to improve rapidly as we progress through 2016. 
With that, I will hand the call back to Pierre."

So what we did, the first step we did, was to remove sales. And we say this year is going to be both $250 [ph] million to remove sales we had, which were not profitable. Once you adjust to a size where you pretty much have a country, which is in sales about 60% of what it was before, then you can adjust your technical sales, and most importantly support functions to serve a business, which is smaller, but having the same type of profit and much higher margin. So that's the way we did it. We believe -- we protected this process, our technology group, our resource group, our technical sales, but really eliminated all of the nonprofitable sales and used that to reduce the organization. We believe that we will be at least as capable an organization to benefit from growth in Brazil than we were before, if not better."

So there is growth synergies which we have not factored here. There is growth for a specific product where we have very strong market demand. And the last one, which could be significant, is price increase depending upon FX. But that's a difficult one to forecast because if FX stays where it is today and there is a decent fourth quarter this year, which means even in a slightly down market, we will have opportunities to increase price in Brazil to recover the gap we have today. But if we continue to have a volatile real next year, we're going to be back in a situation which will be challenging. So hopefully, by the time we get to the February call, we'll know if we have a month or not of real stability. And then we should be able to make a better prediction on price.

That's why we started to try to give a sense for the earnings driver we control, which we expect to participate in the earnings growth for the company next year. Your question is the right one in terms of the market demand. In the third quarter -- or when we are talking about the third quarter results, if we see a situation which starts to unlock in Brazil and Latin America, it will be the definitive signal that the term of the market is going to take place in 2017. If it is the case, then we're in a strong position because by that time, integration will be finished and our cost structure will be very, very solid. We'll be lean without losing potential for growth. Our portfolio technically will be strong and we have new product coming from technology in '17, '18 and '19. So that's when you're going to get your first signal. If we see a Q3, Q4 very challenging in Latin America, then we'll have to understand where is the channel in other countries because then you have to worry it's going to be a slow recovery in '17. We're still banking right now. All indicators are pointing toward a 2017 recovery. But you're correct that third quarter call next year will be -- we should have a better indication."

But we know we have a strong responsibility to our shareholders. All I can tell you is -- the only thing I can tell you for sure is we are not a negative buyer of a large company. I don't think today it will be reasonable. We made a move. We acquired Cheminova. We believe we have a strong geographical footprint. And we don't have the balance sheet to make a major acquisition. So for us, we are in the execution phase.

In general, most of the loss of sales took place in Latin America and mostly Brazil overall and especially because that's a place where we walked away from third-party. We also saw a reduction of sales in other regions of the world. Channel inventories are pretty high in North America and in Europe. Remember, we also have a situation where we are going to direct model in Europe. And we're going to go -- we have sales, which will be moved from this year into next year. So overall, it's across the board. The big difference, I say which is very important is the sales loss outside of Brazil and Latin America are generating very little earnings loss.

The third quarter of 2015 was marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds, the effect of which were most pronounced in the results for Agricultural Solutions. However, excluding the impact of foreign currencies, the Ag Solution business performed in line with expectations, confirming the strength of FMC's portfolio and technology in a weak global ag market. 
Health and Nutrition delivered another solid quarter, continuing to benefit from commercial and operating initiatives implemented over the past 12 months. Lithium continued to see strong demand for its specialty products, including lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high-purity metals.
You will see from the comments today that despite difficult market condition, each of our businesses is performing well with a notable exception of the Brazil ag business. As I will discuss during the call, we are executing a comprehensive program to protect the profitability of our business in Brazil in the current market environment and position the business to deliver earnings growth and higher returns in 2016 and 2017.
Turning now to Slide 1. FMC reported $831 million in revenue in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 1.5% compared to the same period last year.
Adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $95 million, a 37% decrease compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.42, which was $0.42 below the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was higher than our earlier guidance due to lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in more detail shortly.
The significant movement in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, especially in the real and the euro, was the main driver of the decline in FMC's earnings compared to the third quarter of 2014, as price increases in local currency were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency devaluation on our reported results. In the third quarter alone, foreign exchange reduced FMC's reported adjusted operating profit by over $110 million.
I will review the impact of FX in more detail when discussing the performance of each business. 
First, Ag Solutions on Slide 2. Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $578 million and segment earnings of $59 million in the quarter, a decline of 32% and 49% respectively from the pro forma results in the same period of 2014. Price increases and cost reductions only partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volumes.
As noted in our October 12 press release, the rapid devaluation of the Brazilian real created significant headwinds for our business. During the third quarter of 2015 alone, the Brazilian real depreciated over 25% versus the U.S. dollar, reducing segment earnings by over $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2013. While we were successful in implementing significant price increases during the quarter in Brazil, these price increases only offset about half of the currency impact. 
Following the acquisition of Cheminova, FMC initiated the program to rationalize a global product offering and increase our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. This portfolio rationalization, which was accelerated during the third quarter, reduced revenue in Brazil by approximately $120 million compared to the third quarter of 2014. Excluding these actions, sales volumes in Brazil declined only modestly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as demand in Brazil for FMC's differentiated products remained strong. We saw continued volume growth in FMC proprietary product offerings, including sales of insecticides, cotton, fungicides for soybean and herbicides for sugarcane.
In other countries in Latin America, we continued to see strong demand for FMC's product, including selective herbicides in Argentina and products for non-row crop in Colombia and Mexico. Argentina remains an attractive market for FMC, however, obtaining import licenses for formulated products remain a challenge in the short term, reducing our ability to fully take advantage of strong demand for our products in the country.
Outside Latin America, revenues declined mainly as a result of unfavorable currency effect, particularly the euro, and lower volumes, largely as a result of weather, weakness pressure or excess channel inventories. Due to our focus on cost control globally, earnings outside of Latin America were essentially flat with the same period in 2014.
In the face of continued difficult market conditions, FMC aggressively reduced operating cost in the quarter. The cost savings achieved to date will continue to increase throughout Q4 as we accelerate the integration of Cheminova and execute the restructuring of our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, which I will now discuss on Slide 3. 
Through September, we estimate sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil of down approximately 18% in U.S. dollar terms. For the full year, we estimate the market of crop protection chemicals in Brazil will be down mid- to high-teens percent compared to 2014.  Despite the significant decline in sales across the industry in Brazil, there is healthy demand for growers -- from growers for technically differentiated, higher-value in-use product to address specific pest and weed pressures. 
The acquisition of Cheminova has allowed FMC to rationalize its products offering and refocus the combined business in Brazil on FMC's and Cheminova's proprietary technology platform. We firmly believe these actions will position FMC to deliver high growth and higher returns in Latin America in 2016 and beyond. Let me qualify for you the impact of these actions on our 2015 revenue. 
Pro forma for Cheminova -- Ag Solution revenue in Brazil was approximately $1.2 billion in 2014. In 2015, FMC will eliminate some $250 million of low-margin third-party product sales. This includes action taken through the first 6 months of the year such as the previously announced sale of our generic subsidiary, Consagro, as well as action taken in the second half of this year. Excluding this portfolio rationalization, FMC's sales volume in Brazil are expected to be down slightly compared to 2014, reflecting current market conditions. 
As I discussed earlier, foreign exchange will have a significant negative impact on our reported results for the year. Assuming stability in the current U.S. dollars, Brazilian real exchange rates through the end of the year, we expect price increases to recover about 40% of full year impact of foreign currency. Taking these impacts into account, revenue in Brazil is expected to be about $750 million in 2015.
The successful execution of the ongoing portfolio rationalization will have 3 very important implications for FMC. First, it will enable the business to eliminate additional operating cost, which will protect the profitability of the business during this downturn and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery. As I will discuss shortly, based on these actions currently underway, we expect to realize the meaningful reduction in operating cost in both 2016 and 2017.
Second, these actions will allow us to generate higher operating margins and return in Brazil. We will eliminate sales of our lowest margin product and further enhance our focus on FMC's core technical portfolio in Brazil, including higher margins of sulfentrazone, clomazone and malathione proprietary formulation. We will take this opportunity to reduce the capital employed in the business, leading to higher returns on capital, lower hedging and financing costs and stronger cash generation.
Third, the steps we have taken to reduce FMC's revenue base in Brazil combined with a larger revenue base in all other region pro forma for Cheminova will result in greater geographic balance over Ag Solutions business. 
As you can see in the chart on the right side of the slide, Latin America accounted for more than 50% of the Ag Solutions sales in 2014.  In 2015, on a pro forma basis and including the actions I just described, sales in Latin America will account for just over 40% of Ag Solutions revenue. Brazil itself will account for less than 30% of Ag Solutions pro forma revenue in 2015 compared to over 40% in 2014.
Equally important, revenue distribution for North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific is much more balanced. The mixed shift in our regional mix will also contribute to higher overall segment earnings moving into 2016 as our 2 highest margin regions, North America and Europe, will contribute over 40% of Ag Solutions revenue.
As you can see on Slide 4, the original cost-reduction target, announced as part of Cheminova synergies, was $90 million. As a result of the actions we are taking in Brazil and with the reduction in certain corporate functions, we expect global run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million. To be clear, this target is inclusive of the $90 million in synergies related to the integration of Cheminova, which we have discussed at length before today.
Headcount reductions will be the single largest contributor to the incremental cost savings. FMC is now targeting total reduction of 800 to 850 positions. This compares to the 500 to 550 position announced previously. The majority of the additional headcount reduction will be in our Brazil operations. We are moving quickly to realize these cost savings, and the majority of these actions needed to deliver these savings will be implemented in the next 6 months.
We expect to realize approximately $35 million to $40 million in cost savings in 2015. These savings principally related to previously announced actions to integrate Cheminova into FMC. The additional benefit from the further cost reduction program will be realized through 2016 and the first half of 2017, and we expect to deliver additional cost savings of between $50 million to $70 million in 2016.  The success we have achieved to date in delivering the prior synergy targets and the pace at which we have commenced the most recent cost-reduction program give us a high degree of confidence that we'll deliver the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost saving by the middle of 2017.
Let me now turn to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. Q3 was another strong quarter for FMC Health and Nutrition. Reported revenue declined 3% compared to the third quarter of 2014 as foreign exchange headwinds offset favorable volume and improved mix in the quarter. Excluding currency, revenue increased by 2% compared to Q3 2014. Segment earnings increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014 to $47 million in the quarter. 
The business still continued strong volumes and realized improved mix in the quarter. The increase in sales volume was due to continued demand for growth for FMC's MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical market, especially for multinational companies in Europe, engineering producers in India and for full applications in both Asia and North America.
The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continued to benefit from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Segment's operating margins in the quarter increased 250 basis points over last year to 24%. We are pleased with the performance of the business to date and believe Health and Nutrition is well-positioned to deliver continued earnings growth and higher returns going forward. 
Turning to Lithium next on Slide 6. Reported revenue of $57 million decreased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Segment earnings of $1.8 million were $3.5 million lower than the same quarter last year. We continued to see increased demand for FMC's downstream specialty product. However, sales volume were down 13% compared to third quarter of 2014 due to lower third-party carbonate supply and the timing of a scheduled maintenance outage at our lithium hydroxide unit in Bessemer City. In 2015, we entered into a new agreement for a third party to supply lithium carbonate to FMC. Volume under this agreement will increase as we move through Q4 and will help feed our specialty businesses. Operating performance continues to improve. Our facility in Argentina continues to operate at record production rate. However, continued strong operating performance was not self-sufficient to offset the impact of lower sales volume and foreign currency.
Last night, we published our outlook statements for the fourth quarter of 2015. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments on Slide 7. 
We expect most of the headwinds that impacted Q3 results for Ag Solutions to persist through the end of the year. However, as we discussed on our second quarter call, a significant portion of the 2015 cost savings associated with the integration of Cheminova will be realized in the fourth quarter. These cost savings combined with additional price increases and ongoing portfolio rationalization will largely offset the FX headwinds we are facing in Latin America. Outside of Latin America, we expect the business to be flat to 2014. As a result, we estimate Ag Solutions segment earnings to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million for Q4. 
For Health and Nutrition, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million, driven by continued demand for Health and Nutrition's MCC product line and lower operating costs as a result of ongoing Manufacturing Excellence program.
For Lithium, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million. We continue to see strong demand for our specialty products and expect sequentially higher carbonate and hydroxide volumes as well as higher selling prices. As I previously announced, price increases begin to take effect. While inflationary headwinds in Argentina are likely to continue, we expect they will be offset by lower manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter.
After corporate costs, which we estimate to be around $20 million in Q4, adjusted EBIT will be between $140 million and $160 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014 at the midpoint of the range.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me spend a few minutes discussing the outlook for 2016.
While it is premature to give full year guidance, I do want to highlight some of the factors that will impact our 2016 performance. In Ag Solutions, there are a number of factors which are largely in our control that will favorably impact 2016 segment earnings. These include: the previously described incremental cost savings, a full year of earnings contribution from Cheminova and lower operating cost in Brazil due to the benefits of a weaker real. We have a high degree of confidence in the impact of these 3 items, which combined are expected to contribution north of $75 million to segment earnings in 2016. However, external factors, most notably market demand and currency, will have an impact on our reported results. We do not expect any improvement in market conditions in 2016. In fact, based on what we see today, we expect global market demand for crop protection chemicals to be down next year. The extent of the decline will essentially depend on the level of channel inventory not only in Brazil, but also in North America and Europe assuming normal weather and pest pressures.
While foreign currency headwinds appear to have moderated so far in Q4, macroeconomic and geopolitical events impacting foreign exchange rates in each of our key geographic regions continue to evolve. Assuming stability in foreign exchange rate in Brazil, we believe there will be opportunities to continue to recover pricing in that market. However, it will be difficult to qualify the benefit of any future price increases until we are well into 2016 and the next selling season in Brazil.
We expect Health and Nutrition to deliver another year of solid earnings growth, driven by higher volume and an improved cost position. In particular, we see continued strong demand for FMC's MCC and alginate product portfolio across both the pharmaceutical and nutrition market. As we have discussed throughout the year, Health and Nutrition have successfully reduced its operating cost as a result of the ongoing implementation of Manufacturing Excellence initiatives across the business. These efforts will continue into next year and deliver incremental cost savings in 2016. Foreign currency, principally the euro, has negatively impacted reported results in the recent quarters. However, the potential impact of foreign exchange aside, we currently expect Health and Nutrition to deliver segment earnings growth of $10 million to $15 million in 2016.
In our Lithium business, we expect to realize higher selling prices and continued mix improvements from our focus on specialty products as well as the full year benefit of lower operating cost in 2016, which we estimate could increase segment earnings by approximately $10 million. We will enter 2016 with a strong pricing environment for lithium products. In September, our Lithium business announced price increases on all product lines. The majority of this price increases will be realized throughout 2016. Product mix will benefit from the third-party supply of lithium carbonate. This supply will supplement our own lithium carbonate production and feed our specialty businesses. In addition, we will realize the full year benefit from ongoing process improvement programs as well as the new natural gas pipeline, which began operation late in the third quarter this year.  Inflation in Argentina has been a significant drag on Lithium earnings over the past few years. While the election of a new president in Argentina may bring a change in monetary policy and eventual devaluation of the Argentina -- Argentine peso. Such actions are difficult to predict and may take time to unfold. 
Unallocated corporate costs are expected to decline by $15 million to $20 million, reflecting the benefit of the cost reduction actions discussed earlier. 
As you can see, there are a number of factors within our control that we believe will deliver earnings growth in each of our business in 2016. During FMC's Q4 2015 earnings call in February, we will provide more detailed guidance for the coming year. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

As the schedule to our press release clearly explain, our adjusted tax rate is intended to reflect the underlying ta",889,"Thanks, Pierre. Before I discuss cash flow on Slide 9, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax reporting this quarter. 
As the schedule to our press release clearly explain, our adjusted tax rate is intended to reflect the underlying tax rate related to business operations. We have always looked to remove those items that are unrelated to the businesses in presenting our tax rate. However, one item that has been causing increased unpredictability in our reported rate is related to currency movements. For us, historically, that has meant the Argentine peso, the Norwegian kroner and, of course, the Brazilian real. Simply put, we finance and operate our businesses in these countries in a currency that is different than the local currency, but are forced to remeasure certain financial assets and liabilities into local currencies for U.S. GAAP tax purposes. This remeasurement creates adjustments to our U.S. GAAP tax rate without any corresponding impact on our profits before tax. Historically, these items have been small and have not had a material impact on our reported tax rate. However, movements in the euro last year and the Brazilian real this year have created larger distortions to our tax rate than we have ever seen previously.
To put this into context, if we had not made this change in presentation, our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of 2015 would have been negative. Clearly, this would not have been a reflection of our true adjusted tax rate associated with our underlying business and would not have helped any of you understand our business performance any better.
Looking forward, and with expectations of larger movements in the Argentine peso and continued volatility in the Brazilian real, we do not expect this issue to go away. Consequently, we have decided to present our tax rates such that it excludes these discrete remeasurement items. We have recalculated our tax rate under this method for each of the last 6 quarters and included the revised adjusted net income in our press release schedules. 
Let me now move to cash flow performance on Slide 9. As you know, in the current environment, we have placed a significant focus on cash generation. We appreciate that the combined effects of the acquisition of Cheminova, the sale of Alkali and foreign currency movements make it more difficult to extract underlying cash flow performance from our financial statements this year. So I will now walk you through the major components. 
Through the first 9 months of 2015, our EBITDA is almost $100 million less than the same period last year. Despite this, when you look at operating cash flow generated from continuing operations, you can see that FMC generated double the cash flow in 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Part of this improvement can be attributed to lower cash outlays in areas such as capital expenditure and taxes, allowing us to fully offset the temporarily higher interest expense and pension payments. We will continue to be very disciplined in capital spending and look to further optimize our tax position as we take advantage of the opportunities presented to us by Cheminova's footprint.
However, the bulk of the improved operating cash flow performance has come from working capital. So far this year, total cash released from working capital across all 3 segments is approximately $75 million, the majority of which has been from Ag Solutions. While still well below what we are looking to achieve, it represents an improvement over the same period last year of over $300 million, a period when working capital continued to consume cash. This improvement can be largely tracked to lower levels of receivables and inventory. Ag Solutions has generated cash from receivables in all 3 quarters of 2015, something it only achieved in 1 quarter last year. And in 2 of the 3 quarters so far this year, it has seen a reduction in inventory, compared to last year when inventory actually increased in each of the first three quarters.
We continue to focus on these 2 largest drivers of working capital and expect to see the year-on-year improvement in performance continue into the fourth quarter. We expect Ag Solutions to generate a modest positive cash flow from working capital as higher receivables are largely offset by reduced inventory levels. Taken together, we forecast that our cash generated from working capital at 2015 will be almost $350 million better than 2014, which will more than offset the decline in EBITDA over the same period. This focus on cash flow is reflected in a strengthening balance sheet. 
Our quarter-end net debt was just under $2 billion, slightly better than our prior forecast. Our debt consists almost entirely of medium and long-term maturities with our only short-term maturities, namely our commercial paper balances, largely covered by cash on hand. Approximately 50% of our outstanding debt is fixed-rate debt. We are expecting net debt to remain broadly flat at year-end. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio currently sits at just above 3x, largely due to the lower-than-expected EBITDA. As our EBITDA improves and we continue to generate cash from working capital and exercise discipline in all areas of spending, we expect this ratio to improve rapidly as we progress through 2016. 
With that, I will hand the call back to Pierre."

Now in normal times with the real, at that time pretty strong, it made more sense. We were making some profit out of it. But I can tell you, in a situation like the one we have today, the terms which are given to farmers, the weakness in the real do not allow us to have those kind of sales because they do not bring any profit to the company once all of the cost are removed, including the cost of hedging. So what we did, the first step we did, was to remove sales. And we say this year it's going to be about $250 million, to remove sales we had which were not profitable. Once you adjust to a size where you pretty much have a country, which is in sales, about 60% of what it was before then you can adjust your technical sales and, most importantly, support functions to serve a business, which is smaller, but having the same type of profit and much higher margin. So that's the way we did it. We believe, we protected through this process our technology group, our research group, our technical sales, but really eliminated all of the nonprofitable sales and used that to reduce the organization. We believe that we will be, at least, as capable of organization to benefit from growth in Brazil than we were before, if not better."

We are essentially reducing the channel inventories within our own supply chain. So we're not putting customer supply at risk. And we're tending to shift products away from formulating ahead of the season to formulating at the latest possible time. So we're carrying less formulated inventory, but we're carrying active ingredient inventory, which allows us to reduce the total amount but still have flexibility in the customer level. So it's been successful so far. We have more programs in place. I can't actually, Frank, give you a number for the reduction, but you will see it go down as we head into 2016 and probably through the first half of the year."

We know it's happening. We know it's in line with our expectation. But the problem is when you are in a down market, to re-quantify growth synergies is always difficult. So there is growth synergies which we have not factored here. There is growth for a specific product where we have very strong market demand. And the last one, which could be significant, is price increase depending upon FX. But that's a difficult one to forecast, because if FX stays where it is today and there is a decent fourth quarter this year, which means even in a slightly down market we will have opportunities to increase price in Brazil to recover the gap we have today. But if we continue to have a volatile real next year, we're going to be back in a situation which will be challenging. So hopefully, by the time we get to the February call, we'll know if we have full month or not of real stability, and then we should be able to make a little bit better of a prediction around price. So I would say specific growth on the technical product, specific growth synergies with Cheminova and price with the tailwind we could have in addition to what you see here."

So the first step for us, beside delivering on Q4, is really to position FMC for earnings growth regarding of the market demand in 2016. That's why we started to try to give a sense for the earnings driver we control, which we expect to participate in the earnings growth for the company next year. Your question is the right one in terms of the market demand. In the third quarter -- or when we are talking about the third quarter results, if we see a situation which starts to unlock in Brazil and Latin America, it will be the definitive signal that the term of the market is going to take place in 2017. If it is the case, then we're in a strong position, because by that time integration will be finished, and our cost structure will be very, very solid. We'll be lean without losing potential for growth. Our portfolio technically will be strong, and we have new products coming from technology in '17, '18 and '19. So that's when you're going to get your first signal. If we see a Q3, Q4 very challenging in Brazil and Latin America, then we'll have to understand where is the channel in other countries because then you have to worry that it's going to be a slow recovery in '17. We're still banking right now. All indicators are pointing toward a 2017 recovery. But you're correct, that third quarter call next year will be -- we should have a better indication."

Lots of discussions are taking place. How this is going to unfold, I don't think many people know. I don't even know if anybody know. But certainly, there is discussion, which will lead to some consolidation. Where FMC stands in such a situation? First of all, we believe we are a strong company which can strive no matter what is the result for the company, but we will be doing good to shareholders. So what is right for our shareholders, what is right for our employees and what is right for our customer is what we'll do. But we know we have a strong responsibility to other shareholders. All I can tell you is -- the only thing I can tell you for sure is, we are not a negative buyer of a large company. I don't think today it would be reasonable. We've made a move, we've acquired Cheminova. We believe we have a strong geographical footprint. And we don't have the balance sheet to make a major acquisition. So for us, we are in the execution phase. Now, if 2 companies get together, and there is antitrust issues, and they have to drop sales, some products or technology which are of interest to us, absolutely, we will look into buying those technologies if they fit our portfolio.

We lost about $95 million across the world, which are much more linked to the market. If you look at the $44 million, I would say 3/4 of that number is earnings loss, which are coming from the $95 million more than market-driven losses, where maybe 1/4 of the $10 million is linked to the $120 million of third-party sales we voluntarily walked away from. In general, most of the loss of sales took place in Latin America and mostly Brazil overall and especially, because that's a place where we walked away from third party. We also saw reduction of sales in other regions of the world. Channel inventories are pretty high in North America and in Europe. Remember, we also have the situation where we are going to direct model in Europe. So we're going to go -- we have sales which are being moved from this year into next year. So overall, it's across the board. The big difference, I say, which is very important is the sales loss outside of Brazil and Latin America are generating very little earnings loss. We believe our earnings are essentially flat outside of Brazil, around the world. And for some reasons, we have much more leverage around large facilities, cost control in North America in Rockland, or in other places in Asia. So that's the overall picture."

The third quarter of 2015 was marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds, the effect of which were most pronounced in the results for Agricultural Solutions. However, excluding the impact of foreign currencies, the Ag Solution business performed in line with expectations, confirming the strength of FMC's portfolio and technology in a weak global ag market. Health and Nutrition delivered another solid quarter, continuing to benefit from commercial and operating initiatives implemented over the past 12 months. Lithium continued to see strong demand for its specialty products, including lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high-purity metals.
You will see from the comments today that despite difficult market condition, each of our businesses is performing well with a notable exception of the Brazil ag business. As I will discuss during the call, we are executing a comprehensive program to protect the profitability of our business in Brazil in the current market environment and position the business to deliver earnings growth and higher returns in 2016 and 2017.
Turning now to Slide 1. FMC reported $831 million in revenue in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 1.5% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $95 million, a 37% decrease compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.42, which was $0.42 below the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was higher than our earlier guidance due to lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in more detail shortly. The significant movement in foreign exchange rate compared to last year, especially in the real and the euro, was the main driver of the decline in FMC's earnings compared to the third quarter of 2014, as price increases in local currency were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency devaluation on our reported results. In the third quarter alone, foreign exchange reduced FMC's reported adjusted operating profit by over $110 million. I will review the impact of FX in more detail when discussing the performance of each business. 
First, Ag Solutions on Slide 2. Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $578 million and segment earnings of $59 million in the quarter, a decline of 32% and 49%, respectively, from the pro forma results in the same period of 2014. Price increases and cost reductions only partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volumes. As noted in our October 12 press release, the rapid devaluation of the Brazilian real created significant headwinds for our business. During the third quarter of 2015 alone, the Brazilian real depreciated over 25% versus the U.S. dollar, reducing segment earnings by over $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2013. While we were successful in implementing significant price increases during the quarter in Brazil, these price increases only offset about half of the currency impact. 
Following the acquisition of Cheminova, FMC initiated the program to rationalize our global product offering and increase our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. This portfolio rationalization, which was accelerated during the third quarter, reduced revenue in Brazil by approximately $120 million compared to the third quarter of 2014. Excluding these actions, sales volumes in Brazil declined only modestly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as demand in Brazil for FMC's differentiated products remained strong. We saw continued volume growth in FMC proprietary product offerings, including sales of insecticides, cotton, fungicides for soybean and herbicides for sugarcane.
In other countries in Latin America, we continued to see strong demand for FMC's product, including selective herbicides in Argentina and products for non-row crop in Colombia and Mexico. Argentina remains an attractive market for FMC, however, obtaining import licenses for formulated products remain a challenge in the short term, reducing our ability to fully take advantage of strong demand for our products in the country. Outside Latin America, revenues declined mainly as a result of unfavorable currency effect, particularly the euro, and lower volumes, largely as a result of weather, weakness pressure or excess channel inventories. Due to our focus on cost control globally, earnings outside of Latin America were essentially flat with the same period in 2014.
In the face of continued difficult market conditions, FMC aggressively reduced operating cost in the quarter. The cost savings achieved to date will continue to increase throughout Q4 as we accelerate the integration of Cheminova and execute the restructuring of our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, which I will now discuss on Slide 3. Through September, we estimate sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil of down approximately 18% in U.S. dollar terms. For the full year, we estimate the market for crop protection chemicals in Brazil will be down mid- to high-teens percent compared to 2014.  Despite the significant decline in sales across the industry in Brazil, there is healthy demand for growers -- from growers for technically differentiated, higher-value in-use product to address specific pest and weed pressures. 
The acquisition of Cheminova has allowed FMC to rationalize its products offering and refocus the combined business in Brazil on FMC's and Cheminova's proprietary technology platform. We firmly believe these actions will position FMC to deliver higher growth and higher returns in Latin America in 2016 and beyond. Let me qualify for you the impact of these actions on our 2015 revenue. Pro forma for Cheminova Ag Solution revenue in Brazil was approximately $1.2 billion in 2014. In 2015, FMC will eliminate some $250 million of low-margin third-party product sales. This includes action taken through the first 6 months of the year such as the previously announced sale of our generic subsidiary, Consagro, as well as action taken in the second half of this year. Excluding this portfolio rationalization, FMC's sales volume in Brazil are expected to be down slightly compared to 2014, reflecting current market conditions. 
As I discussed earlier, foreign exchange will have a significant negative impact on our reported results for the year. Assuming stability in the current U.S. dollars, Brazilian real exchange rates through the end of the year, we expect price increases to recover about 40% of full year impact of foreign currency. Taking these impacts into account, revenue in Brazil is expected to be about $750 million in 2015.
The successful execution of the ongoing portfolio rationalization will have 3 very important implications for FMC. First, it will enable the business to eliminate additional operating cost, which will protect the profitability of the business during this downturn and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery. As I will discuss shortly, based on these actions currently underway, we expect to realize the meaningful reduction in operating cost in both 2016 and 2017.
Second, these actions will allow us to generate higher operating margins and return in Brazil. We will eliminate sales of our lowest margin product and further enhance our focus on FMC's core technical portfolio in Brazil, including higher margins of sulfentrazone, clomazone and malathione proprietary formulation. We will take this opportunity to reduce the capital employed in the business, leading to higher returns on capital, lower hedging and financing costs and stronger cash generation. Third, the steps we have taken to reduce FMC's revenue base in Brazil combined with a larger revenue base in all other region pro forma for Cheminova will result in greater geographic balance of our Ag Solutions business. 
As you can see in the chart on the right side of the slide, Latin America accounted for more than 50% of Ag Solutions sales in 2014.  In 2015, on a pro forma basis and including the actions I just described, sales in Latin America will account for just over 40% of Ag Solutions revenue. Brazil itself will account for less than 30% of Ag Solutions pro forma revenue in 2015 compared to over 40% in 2014. Equally important, revenue distribution for North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific is much more balanced. The mix shift in our regional mix will also contribute to higher overall segment earnings moving into 2016 as our 2 highest margin regions, North America and Europe, will contribute over 40% of Ag Solutions revenue.
As you can see on Slide 4, the original cost-reduction target, announced as part of Cheminova synergies, was $90 million. As a result of the actions we are taking in Brazil and with the reduction in certain corporate functions, we expect global run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million. To be clear, this target is inclusive of the $90 million in synergies related to the integration of Cheminova, which we have discussed at length before today.
Headcount reductions will be the single largest contributor to the incremental cost savings. FMC is now targeting total reduction of 800 to 850 positions. This compares to the 500 to 550 position announced previously. The majority of the additional headcount reduction will be in our Brazil operations. We are moving quickly to realize these cost savings, and the majority of these actions needed to deliver these savings will be implemented in the next 6 months.
We expect to realize approximately $35 million to $40 million in cost savings in 2015. These savings principally related to previously announced actions to integrate Cheminova into FMC. The additional benefit from the further cost reduction program will be realized through 2016 and the first half of 2017, and we expect to deliver additional cost savings of between $50 million to $70 million in 2016.  The success we have achieved to date in delivering the prior synergy targets and the pace at which we have commenced the most recent cost-reduction program give us a high degree of confidence that we'll deliver the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost saving by the middle of 2017.
Let me now turn to Health and Nutrition on Slide 5. Q3 was another strong quarter for FMC Health and Nutrition. Reported revenue declined 3% compared to the third quarter of 2014 as foreign exchange headwinds offset favorable volume and improved mix in the quarter. Excluding currency, revenue increased by 2% compared to Q3 2014. Segment earnings increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014 to $47 million in the quarter. The business still continued strong volumes and realized improved mix in the quarter. The increase in sales volume was due to continued demand for growth for FMC's MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical market, especially for multinational companies in Europe, engineering producers in India and for full applications in both Asia and North America.
The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continued to benefit from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Segment's operating margins in the quarter increased 250 basis points over last year to 24%. We are pleased with the performance of the business to date and believe Health and Nutrition is well-positioned to deliver continued earnings growth and higher returns going forward. 
Turning to Lithium next on Slide 6. Reported revenue of $57 million decreased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Segment earnings of $1.8 million were $3.5 million lower than the same quarter last year. We continue to see increased demand for FMC's downstream specialty product. However, sales volume were down 13% compared to third quarter of 2014 due to lower third-party carbonate supply and the timing of a scheduled maintenance outage at our lithium hydroxide unit in Bessemer City. In 2015, we entered into a new agreement for a third party to supply lithium carbonate to FMC. Volume under this agreement will increase as we move through Q4 and will help feed our specialty businesses. Operating performance continues to improve. Our facility in Argentina continues to operate at record production rate. However, continued strong operating performance was not sufficient to offset the impact of lower sales volume and foreign currency.
Last night, we published our outlook statements for the fourth quarter of 2015. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments on Slide 7.  We expect most of the headwinds that impacted Q3 results for Ag Solutions to persist through the end of the year. However, as we discussed on our second quarter call, a significant portion of the 2015 cost savings associated with the integration of Cheminova will be realized in the fourth quarter. These cost savings combined with additional price increases and ongoing portfolio rationalization will largely offset the FX headwinds we are facing in Latin America. Outside of Latin America, we expect the business to be flat to 2014. As a result, we estimate Ag Solutions segment earnings to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million for Q4. 
For Health and Nutrition, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million, driven by continued demand for Health and Nutrition's MCC product line and lower operating costs as a result of ongoing Manufacturing Excellence program. For Lithium, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million. We continue to see strong demand for our specialty products and expect sequentially higher carbonate and hydroxide volumes as well as higher selling prices. As I previously announced, price increases begin to take effect. While inflationary headwinds in Argentina are likely to continue, we expect they will be offset by lower manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter. After corporate costs, which we estimate to be around $20 million in Q4, adjusted EBIT will be between $140 million and $160 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter 2014 at the midpoint of the range.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me spend a few minutes discussing the outlook for 2016. While it is premature to give full year guidance, I do want to highlight some of the factors that will impact our 2016 performance. In Ag Solutions, there are a number of factors which are largely in our control that will favorably impact 2016 segment earnings. These include: the previously described incremental cost savings, a full year of earnings contribution from Cheminova and lower operating cost in Brazil due to the benefit of a weaker real. We have a high degree of confidence in the impact of these 3 items, which combined are expected to contribution north of $75 million to segment earnings in 2016. However, external factors, most notably market demand and currency, will have an impact on our reported results. We do not expect any improvement in market conditions in 2016. In fact, based on what we see today, we expect global market demand for crop protection chemicals to be down next year. The extent of the decline will essentially depend on the level of channel inventory not only in Brazil, but also in North America and Europe assuming normal weather and pest pressures.
While foreign currency headwinds appear to have moderated so far in Q4, macroeconomic and geopolitical events impacting foreign exchange rates in each of our key geographic regions continue to evolve. Assuming stability in foreign exchange rate in Brazil, we believe there will be opportunities to continue to recover pricing in that market. However, it will be difficult to qualify the benefit of any future price increases until we are well into 2016 and the next selling season in Brazil.
We expect Health and Nutrition to deliver another year of solid earnings growth, driven by higher volume and an improved cost position. In particular, we see continued strong demand for FMC's MCC and alginate product portfolio across both the pharmaceutical and nutrition market. As we have discussed throughout the year, Health and Nutrition have successfully reduced its operating cost as a result of the ongoing implementation of Manufacturing Excellence initiatives across the business. These efforts will continue into next year and deliver incremental cost savings in 2016. Foreign currency, principally the euro, has negatively impacted reported results in the recent quarters. However, the potential impact of foreign exchange aside, we currently expect Health and Nutrition to deliver segment earnings growth of $10 million to $15 million in 2016.
In our Lithium business, we expect to realize higher selling prices and continued mix improvements from our focus on specialty products as well as the full year benefit of lower operating cost in 2016, which we estimate could increase segment earnings by approximately $10 million. We will enter 2016 with a strong pricing environment for lithium products. In September, our Lithium business announced price increases on all product lines. The majority of these  price increases will be realized throughout 2016. Product mix will benefit from the third-party supply of lithium carbonate. This supply will supplement our own lithium carbonate production and feed our specialty businesses. In addition, we will realize the full year benefit from ongoing process improvement programs as well as the new natural gas pipeline, which began operation late in the third quarter this year.  Inflation in Argentina has been a significant drag on Lithium earnings over the past few years. While the election of a new president in Argentina may bring a change in monetary policy and eventual devaluation of the Argentina -- Argentine peso, such actions are difficult to predict and may take time to unfold. 
Unallocated corporate costs are expected to decline by $15 million to $20 million, reflecting the benefit of the cost reduction actions discussed earlier. As you can see, there are a number of factors within our control that we believe will deliver earnings growth in each of our business in 2016. During FMC's Q4 2015 earnings call in February, we will provide more detailed guidance for the coming year. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

Before I discuss cash flow on Slide 9, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax reporting this quarter. As the schedule to our press release clearly explained, our adjusted tax rate is intended to reflect the underlying",889,"Thanks, Pierre. Before I discuss cash flow on Slide 9, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax reporting this quarter. 
As the schedule to our press release clearly explained, our adjusted tax rate is intended to reflect the underlying tax rate related to business operations. We have always looked to remove those items that are unrelated to the businesses in presenting our tax rate. However, one item that has been causing increased unpredictability in our reported rate is related to currency movements. For us, historically, that has meant the Argentine peso, the Norwegian kroner and, of course, the Brazilian reais. Simply put, we finance and operate our businesses in these countries in a currency that is different than the local currency, but are forced to remeasure certain financial assets and liabilities into local currencies for U.S. GAAP tax purposes. This remeasurement creates adjustments to our U.S. GAAP tax rate without any corresponding impact on our profits before tax. Historically, these items have been small and have not had a material impact on our reported tax rate. 
However, movements in the euro last year and the Brazilian reais this year have created larger distortions to our tax rate than we have ever seen previously. To put this into context, if we had not made this change in presentation, our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of 2015 would have been negative. Clearly, this would not have been a reflection of our true adjusted tax rate associated with our underlying business and would not have helped any of you understand our business performance any better.
Looking forward, and with expectations of larger movements in the Argentine peso and continued volatility in the Brazilian reais, we do not expect this issue to go away. Consequently, we have decided to present our tax rate such that it excludes these discrete remeasurement items. We have recalculated our tax rate under this method for each of the last 6 quarters and included the revised adjusted net income in our press release schedules. 
Let me now move to cash flow performance on Slide 9. As you know, in the current environment, we have placed a significant focus on cash generation. We appreciate that the combined effects of the acquisition of Cheminova, the sale of Alkali and foreign currency movements make it more difficult to extract underlying cash flow performance from our financial statements this year. So I will now walk you through the major components. 
Through the first 9 months of 2015, our EBITDA is almost $100 million less than the same period last year. Despite this, when you look at operating cash flow generated from continuing operations, you can see that FMC generated double the cash flow in 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Part of this improvement can be attributed to lower cash outlays in areas such as capital expenditure and taxes, allowing us to fully offset the temporarily higher interest expense and pension payments. We will continue to be very disciplined in capital spending and look to further optimize our tax position as we take advantage of the opportunities presented to us by Cheminova's footprint.
However, the bulk of the improved operating cash flow performance has come from working capital. So far this year, total cash released from working capital across all 3 segments is approximately $75 million, the majority of which has been from Ag Solutions. While still well below what we are looking to achieve, it represents an improvement over the same period last year of over $300 million, a period when working capital continued to consume cash. This improvement can be largely tracked to lower levels of receivables and inventory. Ag Solutions has generated cash from receivables in all 3 quarters of 2015, something it only achieved in 1 quarter last year. And in 2 of the 3 quarters so far this year, it has seen a reduction in inventory, compared to last year when inventory actually increased in each of the first three quarters.
We continue to focus on these 2 largest drivers of working capital and expect to see the year-on-year improvement in performance continue into the fourth quarter. We expect Ag Solutions to generate a modest positive cash flow from working capital as higher receivables are largely offset by reduced inventory levels. Taken together, we forecast that our cash generated from working capital in 2015 will be almost $350 million better than 2014, which will more than offset the decline in EBITDA over the same period. 
This focus on cash flow is reflected in a strengthening balance sheet. Our quarter-end net debt was just under $2 billion, slightly better than our prior forecast. Our debt consists almost entirely of medium and long-term maturities with our only short-term maturities, namely our commercial paper balances, largely covered by cash on hand. Approximately 50% of our outstanding debt is fixed-rate debt. We are expecting net debt to remain broadly flat at year-end. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio currently sits at just above 3x, largely due to the lower-than-expected EBITDA. As our EBITDA improves and we continue to generate cash from working capital and exercise discipline in all areas of spending, we expect this ratio to improve rapidly as we progress through 2016. 
With that, I will hand the call back to Pierre."

Now in normal times with the real, at that time pretty strong, it made more sense. We were making some profit out of it. But I can tell you, in a situation like the one we have today, the terms which are given to farmers, the weakness in the real do not allow us to have those kind of sales because they do not bring any profit to the company once all of the cost are removed, including the cost of hedging. So what we did, the first step we did was to remove sales. And we say this year it's going to be about $250 million, to remove sales we had which were not profitable. Once you adjust to a size where you pretty much have a country, which is in sales, about 60% of what it was before then you can adjust your technical sales and, most importantly, support functions to serve a business, which is smaller, but having the same type of profit and much higher margin. So that's the way we did it. We believe, we've protected through this process our technology group, our research group, our technical sales, but really eliminated all of the non-profitable sales and used that to reduce the organization. We believe that we will be at least as capable of organization to benefit from growth in Brazil than we were before, if not better."

And what we're doing is, we're taking advantage of the Cheminova acquisition to look at the combined businesses and understand the flow of materials. We are essentially reducing the channel inventories within our own supply chain. So we're not putting customer supply at risk. And we're tending to shift products away from formulating ahead of the season to formulating at the latest possible time. So we're carrying less formulated inventory, but we're carrying active ingredient inventory, which allows us to reduce the total amount but still have flexibility at the customer level. So it's been successful so far. We have more programs in place. I can't actually, Frank, give you a number for the reduction, but you will see it go down as we head into 2016 and probably through the first half of the year."

That should allow us more flexibility in terms of taking advantage of the market down there. For us that market is pre-herbicides for soy, big market for us. We use our Authority brands based upon sulfentrazone. Currently today, we're in the $80 million to $100 million of revenue range. We see that growing despite a difficult market, so it's significant for us. Getting the import licenses has been, frankly, a bit of a pain over the last year or so, but eventually that will free up because the growers down there do need the technology to get the highest yields for especially the row crops of soybeans."

Then there is the question of growth synergies with Syngenta. We are very careful with, sorry, not Syngenta, that's about -- with Cheminova. We have a difficulty to really quantify that. We know it's happening. We know it's in line with our expectation. But the problem is when you are in a down market, to re-quantify growth synergies is always difficult. So there is growth synergies which we have not factored here. There is growth for a specific product where we have very strong market demand. And the last one, which could be significant, is price increase depending upon FX. But that's a difficult one to forecast, because if FX stays where it is today and there is a decent fourth quarter this year, which means even in a slightly down market we will have opportunities to increase price in Brazil to recover the gap we have today. But if we continue to have a volatile real next year, we're going to be back in a situation which will be challenging. So hopefully, by the time we get to the February call, we'll know if we have 4 month or not of real stability, and then we should be able to make a little bit better of a prediction around price. So I would say specific growth on the technical product, specific growth synergies with Cheminova and price with the tailwind we could have in addition to what you see here."

I think we have the structure in place. The integration is well advanced. The cost savings are coming as we are expecting. So the first step for us, beside delivering on Q4, is really to position FMC for earning growth regarding of the market demand in 2016. That's why we started to try to give a sense for the earnings driver we control, which we expect to participate in the earning growth for the company next year. Your question is the right one in terms of the market demand. In the third quarter or when we are talking about the third quarter result, if we see a situation which starts to unlock in Brazil and Latin America, it will be the definitive signal that the turn of the market is going to take place in 2017. If it is the case, then we're in a strong position, because by that time integration will be finished, and our cost structure will be very, very solid. We'll be lean without losing potential for growth. Our portfolio technically will be strong, and we have new product coming from technology in '17, '18 and '19. So that's when you're going to get your first signal. If we see a Q3, Q4 very challenging in Brazil and Latin America, then we'll have to understand where is the channel in other countries because then you have to worry that it's going to be a slow recovery in '17. We are still banking right now. All indicators are pointing toward a 2017 recovery. But you're correct, that third quarter call next year will be -- we should have a better indication."

Lots of discussions are taking place. How this is going to unfold, I don't think many people know. I don't even know if anybody know. But certainly, there is discussion, which will lead to some consolidation. Where FMC stands in such a situation? First of all, we believe we have a strong company which can strive no matter what is the result for the company, but we will be doing good to shareholders. So what is right for our shareholders, what is right for our employees and what is right for our customer is what we'll do. But we know we have a strong responsibility to other shareholders. All I can tell you is -- the only thing I can tell you for sure is, we are not an active buyer of a large company. I don't think today it would be reasonable. We've made a move, we've acquired Cheminova. We believe we have a strong geographical footprint. And we don't have the balance sheet to make a major acquisition. So for us, we are in the execution phase. Now, if 2 companies get together, and there is antitrust issues, and they have to drop sale, some products or technology which are of interest to us, absolutely, we will look into buying those technologies if they fit our portfolio. But that's about the limit of our proactivity in terms of being on the acquiring side."

There is 2 bucket to it. There is the third-party sales, which we walked away from in Brazil and that's about $120 million, and the rest are just volume. We lost about $95 million across the world, which are much more linked to the market. If you look at the $44 million, I would say 3/4 of that number is earnings loss, which are coming from the $95 million more than market-driven losses, where maybe 1/4 of the $10 million is linked to the $120 million of third-party sales we voluntarily walked away from. In general, most of the loss of sales took place in Latin America and mostly Brazil overall and especially, because that's a place where we walked away from third party. We also saw reduction of sales in other regions of the world. Channel inventories are pretty high in North America and in Europe. Remember, we also have the situation where we are going to direct model in Europe. So we're going to go -- we have sales which are being moved from this year into next year. So overall, it's across the board. The big difference, I say, which is very important is the sales loss outside of Brazil and Latin America are generating very little earnings loss. We believe our earnings are essentially flat outside of Brazil, around the world. And then for some reasons, we have much more leverage around large facilities, cost control in North America, in Ronland or in other places in Asia. So that's the overall picture."
