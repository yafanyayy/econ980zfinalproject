In Q4, the global Alexion team drove a strong conclusion to 2014. As we advance our relentless mission to provide a transformative therapist to patients, with severe and life-threatening disorders.
During Q4, our commercial organization again provided an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our operations in 50 countries. Our development teams made continued and strong progress in the quarter, notably with the completion of the rolling submission of our BLA for asfotase alfa in the United States and also our submission in Japan.
Importantly, we reported the advanced one of the first 2 next generation Soliris molecules into the clinics and based on initial clinical data, at least one of these molecules were advance into Phase II PNH trials this year. And finally, we another year of strong financial performance in 2015. Equally important, we now are pleased to announce that we expect significant improvements in both our 2015 and longer-term effective tax rate compared to previous guidance.
Our accomplishments throughout 2014 position us to reach a new set of significant milestones on behalf of patients this year and beyond. By every major, Alexion is that the strongest and most promising point in our history. Our commercial and financial performance are at record levels. Our potential to deliver new therapies to patients is greater than ever. And we have a world-class team of talented and dedicated colleagues at every level of the organization.
Thus I'm confident that the time is right for the company and for me personally, to complete our plan leadership transition as we announced this morning. The Board and I are delighted that David Hallal will become our second CEO. David has been instrumental in driving our results and in shaping our high-performance culture. He has demonstrated outstanding leadership at Alexion playing a principal role in leading many of the companies key initiatives on behalf of patient, including the highly successful launches of Soliris for PNH and aHUS, while also driving the buildout of Alexion 50-country operating platform.
Since joining Alexion 9 years ago, David has expanded across the entire organization. And over the last several years, key and I am increasingly share responsibilities. Now it's the right time for David to lead Alexion [Audio Gap]

I am deeply honored to become Alexion's next CEO. On behalf of the entire organization, I would like to thank Lenny for his leadership in building Alexion into one of the most successful and innovative biotechnology companies in the world. Developing a company-wide commitment and innovation, creating our patient-focused culture and in filling and operational excellence that have driven our remarkable success over the last 2 decades.
I look forward to leading our dedicated and talented employees worldwide as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plan focused on developing and delivering innovative therapies for patients with devastating and life-threatening disorders.
As we close another record year in 2014, and as a look at the company today, I see more than $2 billion in revenues with far more growth ahead of us in our in-line businesses. The launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, this year. The most robust pipeline in our history, with 3 ongoing registration programs and 4 additional highly-innovative molecules in clinical development.
Global leadership and to serve patients through the next 2 decades. A strong foundation for future growth with an additional 17 preclinical development programs, expanding diverse moralities and therapeutic areas. And lastly, our balance sheet aligned with our strong growth objectives. We have never been better positioned to leverage our unique 50-country commercial platform to drive future product expansion.
Now turning to our performance in Q4. We our mission by reaching significant milestones across our commercial and pipeline initiatives. Looking first to PNH. Our performance in 2014 affirms our view that on a global basis the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, led alone commence appropriate treatment. Throughout 2014, as in prior years, we continue to identify a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories in which we have operated the longest.
As we look at 2015, we have strong confection in our PNH franchise, as we aim to serve anymore patients around the world.
Turning to aHUS. We continue to observe a steady addition of new patient commencing Soliris treatment in the U.S. and Europe in 2014. While we made important progress in the early stages of our launch in Japan. Globally, the ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to do so patients with aHUS is large opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. As one measure in the U.S., now more than 3 years following the respective FDA approvals, more patients are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than they had been for PNH.
In Europe, we are observing a similar trends in the early stages of our aHUS launch. These observations support our view that the of aHUS is likely higher than PNH.
Looking at 2015 and beyond, we continue to see that the majority of our aHUS growth is ahead of us, supported by our strength in labels in U.S. and Europe, which demonstrates the immediate and long-term benefit of early and sustained treatment for patients with aHUS.
Our experience with PNH and aHUS provides us with key learnings to support the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, for patients with HPP. In 2014, we completed the regulatory filings in the U.S., EU and Japan and we expect approvals in all of these territories this year. This creates the potential to commence launches in the U.S. and Germany during the first half of 2015 and in Japan by year end.
Asfotase alfa will be the first of as many as 7 new indication product approvals through 2018. These include eculizumab and DGF, NMO, MG and AMR. One or more of our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules, as well as for infants with MoCD Type A within the same period. As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, which Martin will discuss later in the call.
Looking briefly at our 2014 financial performance. For the full year, we achieved 38% revenue growth for 2014 in-year sales compared to 2013. We also demonstrated strong operational leverage with 57% EPS growth associated with sales for 2014.
Turning to our 2015 guidance, we announced this morning our revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion despite headwinds.
On a constant currency basis, we would expect in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. Robust growth for Soliris strong underlying demand with anticipated additions of similar number of new patients on treatment year-on-year.
Our revenue guidance will also [Audio Gap] include small initial contributions from asfotase alfa. We are pleased that even with our increased investment in our global infrastructure, including preparation for the launch of asfotase alfa, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins as compared to 2014.
Finally, as Vikas describe in more detail, we expect to see immediate improvements in both our 2015 effective tax rate and our long-term tax rate as compared to prior guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"

In Q4, the study increase in uptick of Soliris among PNH and aHUS patients is our core territories and newer markets, resulted in strong revenue and EPS growth during the quarter and for the year.
Revenue in Q4 increased 36% year-on-year to [Audio Gap] million, despite the early weakness [Audio Gap] late in the quarter.
Turning to the full year. As noted in this morning's press release, 2014 in-year revenues of $2.15 billion, exclude $88 million related to reimbursement of prior year sales For the full year 2014, in-year sales increased 38% compared to 2013. Excluding one-time 2014 price benefits, sales increased by approximately $500 million compared to 2013.
By exceeding our revenue target, while maintaining strict financial discipline in our growing commercial and clinical activities, we reported 2014 non-GAAP EPS of $5.21 per diluted share, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of $88 million in 2014 sales, EPS would be $4.84, an increase of 57%.
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end grew by nearly $450 million to $1.9 billion. We achieve this gain through strong positive cash flow from operations, which also enabled us to repurchase $300 million of our own shares during the year. As a result of that repurchase, our total shares outstanding for Q4 2014 were 204 million shares, nearly unchanged from Q4 2013.
I would now like to turn to our 2015 guidance. We are getting 2015 total revenue in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. I would not that our 2015 revenue forecast assumes that currencies remain at the current exchange rate through the year. As a result, and reflecting the 2/3 of our revenue are outside of the U.S., our 2015 revenue guidance includes a negative FX impact of approximately 5% of revenues or $135 million after hedging.
On a constant currency basis, without this 5% impact, our total revenue forecast in 2015 would have been greater than $2.7 billion, which would represent an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. This forecast reflects our expectation of continued strong growth at Soliris with expected addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment in 2015 compared to 2014, as well as a small initial asfotase alfa contribution.
Turning to Q1 revenue. I would like to note that the increasingly negative sequential effect impact during Q1 combined with 2 few orders are expected to result in Q1 revenues in the range of $585 million to $590 million.
Looking at other elements of our 2015 guidance, I will highlight the following: first, -- [Audio Gap] is expected to increase in the second half of the year as we launch asfotase alfa, which will have higher cost of goods than Soliris; second, despite the headwinds and our continued investment in our global infrastructure for the asfotase alfa launch, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins compared to 2014; third, we see the benefit of our further improvement in our effective tax rate. Our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 7% to 9%, lower than our previous forecast of 13% to 15%. This benefit results from entering 2015 with a higher level of tax credits remaining than we previously expected.
In addition, beyond 2015, we will continue to benefit from our latest tax rate compared to our prior guidance. We now anticipate that our tax rate will be 12% to 13% in 2016, and 14% to 16% in 2017 and subsequent years.
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5.50 [Audio Gap] to $5.80. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been approximately [Audio Gap]

Looking at 2015, I would like to update you on our lead development programs that we drive toward our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications on product approvals through 2018.
First, asfotase alfa. Our highly innovative potential therapy for patients with HPP. As David mentioned, we continue to expect decisions in the U.S. and EU in the first half of 2015, followed by a decision in Japan by the end of the year. We're working with regulatory authorities to obtain these marketing authorizations as quickly as possible, even the high of mortality, severe effects and current lack of any approved therapies for patients with HPP.
We continue to build the growing body of clinical data reflecting the potentially impact for asfotase alfa. In early March, the meeting, new data will be presented showing rapid and continued improvements in muscle strength, significant gains in the physical function and reduction in pain in children receiving asfotase alfa for up to 3 years.
Importantly, new of disease data in adults with HPP will also be presented at -- And we plan to start a clinical study with asfotase alfa in adult patients with severe HPP in 2015.
I would now like to turn to our development programs with eculizumab. Beginning with our 3 multinational registration trials of in delayed-graft function, [Audio Gap] and myasthenia gravis. We expect to complete enrollment in our DGS trial in kidney transplant patients at increased risk for rejection and early graft loss by the end of the year.
In our neurology programs with eculizumab, in Q4, we were pleased that Soliris was granted orphan drug designations in Japan for both the treatment of patients with NMO and MG.
In our registration trial in relaxing NMO, the prevent study enrollment and dosing our ongoing.
In our registration trial and refractory MG, the regained study, we expect to complete enrollment in the study this year.
As and complement biology, we advanced our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014. As we announced on the Q3 call, we initiated Phase I studies of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules, ALXN1210 and ALXN5500 with additional molecules and programs in our expanding portfolio at earlier stages of development.
The data already support our advancing both of these molecules into further trials, and we intend to progress at least one of them into a Phase II PNH trial this year with additional indications likely to follow.
ALXN1210 Is a longer acting anti-C5 antibody, suitable for one monthly dosing. We are targeting approval of at least one next generation candidate in 2018. We also have lead development programs with 2 additional highly innovative therapies, ALXN1007 and cPMP. We have commenced dosing in 2 Phase II proof-of-concept studies to validate the safety and tolerability of ALXN1007 in patients with 2 severe and potentially life-threatening diseases. -- disease involving the gastrointestinal tract or GITVHD and anti- syndrome or APS. We expect to have interim data in study later in 2015.
In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP Replacement Therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A. cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015.
We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study. Within our portfolio of 17 preclinical programs to drive into growth, I would like to turn briefly to our collaboration with -- where we have initiated preclinical development in our first 7 mRNA rare disease programs, and our targeting our first candidate to enter the clinic in 2016.
As we build on our accomplishments in 2014, we are well-positioned to achieve at least 12 development milestones across our pipelines in 2015. These include, the U.S., EU and Japan approvals of asfotase alfa. The initiation of a study evaluating asfotase alfa in adults with severe HPP. The completion of enrollment in the DGF and MG registration trial. The initiation of company's clinical study with eculizumab for the treatment of AMR, as well as data from the Phase II study for the prevention of AMR.
Completion of the Phase I next-generation Soliris studies for the first 2 molecules and the initiation of our Phase II study for one or more of these molecules in patients. And interim data on the Phase II proof-of-concept study for ALXN1007 in patients with

We've had a study that tend study has remains open, and that has enabled some patients with HPP to access treatment, even after we had locked all of our databases associated with all of our clinical trials and utilized that for the submissions to the U.S., EU and Japanese authorities. And as we look at 2015, U.S. and Germany first half of the year, and then Japan, near year end. The challenging thing is and as he said, it's difficult to pinpoint the patient numbers, given the very low incidence of the disease and then of course, the very high mortality rate in the youngest patients with HPP. And mortality of above 70% at 3 years. So as we look at the launch and the overall opportunity, we have very strong conviction on this opportunity to dramatically improve the lives and save the lives of the patients, who suffer from HPP. But it something that I think is going to take some time. I think it'll be a steady trajectory at approval, and we will build out the portfolio over time."

In Q4, the global Alexion team drove a strong conclusion to 2014 as we advanced our relentless mission to provide transformative therapies to patients with severe and life-threatening disorders.
During Q4, our commercial organization again provided Soliris to an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our operations in 50 countries. Our development teams made continued and strong progress in the quarter, notably with the completion of the rolling submission of our BLA for asfotase alfa in the United States and also our submission in Japan.
Importantly, we reported the advanced -- one of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules into their clinic, and based on initial clinical data, at least one of these molecules will advance into Phase II PNH trials this year. And finally, we cite another year of strong financial performance in 2015. Equally important, we now are pleased to announce that we expect significant improvements in both our 2015 and longer-term effective tax rates compared to previous guidance.
Our accomplishments throughout 2014 position us to reach a new set of significant milestones on behalf of patients this year and beyond. By every measure, Alexion is at the strongest and most promising point in our history. Our commercial and financial performance are at record levels. Our potential to deliver new therapies to patients is greater than ever, and we have a world-class team of talented and dedicated colleagues at every level of the organization.
Thus, I'm confident that the time is right for the company and for me, personally, to complete our planned leadership transition as we announced this morning. The Board and I are delighted that David Hallal will become our second CEO. David has been instrumental in driving our results and in shaping our high-performance culture. He has demonstrated outstanding leadership at Alexion playing a principal role in leading many of the companies key initiatives on behalf of patients, including the highly successful launches of Soliris for PNH and aHUS, while also driving the buildout of Alexion's 50-country operating platform.
Since joining Alexion 9 years ago, David's role has expanded across the entire organization. And over the last several years, he and I have increasingly shared responsibilities. Now it's the right time for David to lead Alexion.

I am deeply honored to become Alexion's next CEO. On behalf of the entire organization, I would like to thank Lenny for his extraordinary leadership in building Alexion into one of the most successful and innovative biotechnology companies in the world, developing a company-wide commitment to innovation, creating our patient-focused culture and instilling exquisite discipline and operational excellence that have driven our remarkable success over the last 2 decades.
I look forward to leading our dedicated and talented employees worldwide as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plan focused on developing and delivering innovative therapies for patients with devastating and life-threatening disorders.
As we close another record year in 2014 and as I look at the company today, I see more than $2 billion in revenues with far more growth ahead of us in our in-line businesses; the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, this year; the most robust pipeline in our history with 3 ongoing registration programs; and 4 additional highly innovative molecules in clinical developments; global leadership and complement science to serve patients through the next 2 decades; a strong foundation for future growth, with an additional 17 preclinical development programs, spanning diverse modalities in therapeutic areas; and lastly, our balance sheet aligned with our strong growth objectives. We have never been better positioned to leverage our unique 50-country commercial platform to drive future product expansion.
Now turning to our performance in Q4. We advanced our mission by reaching significant milestones across our commercial and pipeline initiatives.
Looking first to PNH. Our performance in 2014 affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. Throughout 2014, as in prior years, we continue to identify a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories in which we have operated the longest. As we look at 2015, we have strong conviction in our PNH franchise, as we aim to serve many more patients around the world.
Turning to aHUS. We continue to observe a steady addition of new patients commencing Soliris treatment in the U.S. and Europe in 2014, while we made important progress in the early stages of our launch in Japan. Globally, the ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. As one measure in the U.S., now more than 3 years following their respective FDA approvals, more patients are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. In Europe, we are observing a similar trend in the earlier stages of our aHUS launch. These observations support our view that the incidence of aHUS is likely higher than PNH.
Looking at 2015 and beyond, we continue to see that the majority of our aHUS growth is ahead of us, supported by our strength in labels in the U.S. and Europe, which demonstrate the immediate and long-term benefit of early and sustained treatment for patients with aHUS.
Our experience with PNH and aHUS provides us with key learnings to support the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, for patients with HPP.
In 2014, we completed the regulatory filings in the U.S., EU and Japan, and we expect approvals in all of these territories this year. This creates the potential to commence launches in the U.S. and Germany during the first half of 2015 and in Japan by year-end.
Asfotase alfa will be the first of as many as 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018. These include eculizumab, and DGF, NMO, MG, and AMR, one or more of our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules as well as cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A within the same period. As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, which Martin will discuss later in the call.
Looking briefly at our 2014 financial performance. For the full year, we achieved 38% revenue growth for 2014 in-year sales compared to 2013. We also demonstrated strong operational leverage with 57% EPS growth associated with in-year sales for 2014.
Turning to our 2015 guidance. We announced this morning our revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion despite currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we would expect an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. Robust growth for Soliris reflects strong underlying demand with the anticipated addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment year-on-year. Our revenue guidance also includes a small initial contribution from asfotase alfa.
We are pleased that even with our increased investment in our global infrastructure, including preparation for the launch of asfotase alfa, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins as compared to 2014.
Finally, and as Vikas will describe in more detail, we expect to see immediate improvements in both our 2015 effective tax rate and our long-term tax rate as compared to prior guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"
347983,282568316,751432,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David.

In Q4, the steady increase in uptick of Soliris among PNH and aHUS patients in our core territories and newer markets resulted in strong revenue and EPS growth during the quarter and for the year.
Revenue in Q4 increased 36% year-on-year to $599 million despite the early signs of weakness in key FX currencies late in the quarter.
Turning to the full year. And as noted in this morning's press release, 2014 in-year revenues of $2.15 billion, exclude $88 million related to reimbursement for prior year sales in France. Thus, for the full year 2014, in-year sales increased 38% compared to 2013. Excluding onetime 2014 price benefits, sales increased by approximately $500 million compared to 2013. By exceeding our revenue target while maintaining strict financial discipline in our growing commercial and clinical activities, we reported 2014 non-GAAP EPS of $5.21 per diluted share, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of $88 million in pre-2014 sales, EPS would be $4.84, an increase of 57%.
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end grew by nearly $450 million to $1.9 billion. We achieved these gains through a strong positive cash flow from operations, which also enabled us to repurchase $300 million of our own shares during the year. As a result of that repurchase, our total shares outstanding for Q4 2014 were 204 million shares, nearly unchanged from Q4 2013.
I would now like to turn to our 2015 guidance. We are guiding 2015 total revenue in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. I would note that our 2015 revenue forecast assumes that key currencies remain at the current exchange rates through the year. As a result in reflecting that 2/3 of our revenues are outside of the U.S. Our 2015 revenue guidance includes a negative FX impact of approximately 5% of revenues or $135 million after hedging.
On a constant currency basis, without this 5% impact, our total revenue forecast in 2015 would have been greater than $2.7 billion, which would represent an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. This forecast reflects our expectation of continued strong growth at Soliris with expected addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as a small initial asfotase alfa contribution.
Turning to Q1 revenue. I would like to note that the increasingly negative sequential FX impact during Q1 combined with 2 fewer days are expected to result in Q1 revenues in the range of $585 million to $590 million.
Looking at other elements of our 2015 guidance, I will highlight the following: First, cost of goods is expected to increase in the second half of the year, as we launch asfotase alfa, which will have higher cost of goods than Soliris; Second, despite the FX headwinds and our continued investment in our global infrastructure for the asfotase alfa launch, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins compared to 2014; Third, we see the benefit of our further improvement in our effective tax rates. Our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 7% to 9%, lower than our previous forecast of 13% to 15%. This benefit results from entering 2015 with a higher level of tax credits remaining than we previously expected.
In addition, beyond 2015, we will continue to benefit from a reduced tax rate compared to our prior guidance. We now anticipate that our tax rate will be 12% to 13% in 2016, and 14% to 16% in 2017 and subsequent years.
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been approximately $0.30 higher.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In 2014, our R&D teams made important progress in our mission to serve more patients with devastating and rare diseases. I am very pleased that we surpassed our goal of achieving 10 development milestones over the year.
Looking to 2015, I would like to update you on our lead development programs as we drive towards our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.
First, asfotase alfa, our highly innovative potential therapy for patients with HPP. As David mentioned, we continue to expect decisions in the U.S. and EU in the first half of 2015 followed by a decision in Japan by the end of the year. We are working with regulatory authorities to obtain these marketing authorizations as quickly as possible, given the high rates of mortality, severe debilitating effects and current lack of any approved therapy for patients with HPP.
We continue to build the growing body of clinical data reflecting the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. In early March, at the end of the [indiscernible] Society meeting, new data will be presented showing rapid and continued improvements in muscle strength, significant gains and physical function and reduction in pain in children receiving asfotase alfa for up to 3 years. Importantly, new Burden of Disease Data in Adults with HPP will also be presented at ENDO, and we plan to start a clinical study with asfotase alfa in adult patients with severe HPP in 2015.
I would now like to turn to our development programs with eculizumab beginning with our 3 multinational registration trials of eculizumab in delayed graft function, neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis. We expect to complete enrollment in our DGF trial in kidney transplant patients at increased risk for rejection and early graft loss by the end of the year.
In our neurology programs with eculizumab, in Q4, we were pleased that Soliris was granted orphan drug designations in Japan for both the treatment of patients with NMO and MG. In our registration trial in relapsing NMO, the PREVENT study enrollment and dosing our ongoing. In our registration trial in refractory MG, the REGAIN study, we expect to complete enrollment in this study this year.
As the leaders in complement biology, we advanced our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014. As we announced on the Q3 call, we initiated Phase I studies of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules, ALXN1210 and ALXN5500, with additional molecules and programs in our expanding portfolio at earlier stages of development. The data already support advancing both of these molecules into further trials, and we intend to progress at least one of them into a Phase II PNH trial this year with additional indications likely to follow. ALXN1210 is a longer acting anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, suitable for once monthly dosing. We are targeting approval of at least one next generation candidate in 2018.
We also have lead development programs with 2 additional highly innovative therapies, ALXN1007 and cPMP. We have commenced dosing in 2 Phase II proof-of-concept studies to validate the safety and tolerability of ALXN1007 in patients with 2 severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases. Graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract or GI-GVHD and antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. We expect to have interim data in the GI-GVHD study later in 2015.
In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A. The synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study.
Within our portfolio of 17 preclinical programs to drive future growth, I would like to turn briefly to our collaboration with Moderna, where we have initiated preclinical development in our first 7 mRNA rare disease programs and are targeting our first candidate to enter the clinic in 2016.
As we build on our accomplishments in 2014, we are well-positioned to achieve at least 12 development milestones across our pipelines in 2015. These include, the U.S., EU and Japan approvals of asfotase alfa, the initiation of a study evaluating asfotase alfa in adults with severe HPP, the completion of enrollment in the DGF and MG registration trials, the initiation of a company sponsored clinical study with eculizumab for the treatment of AMR as well as data from the Phase II deceased donor study for the prevention of AMR, completion of the Phase I next-generation Soliris studies for the first 2 molecules, and the initiation of a Phase II study for one or more of these molecules in PNH patients and interim data from the Phase II proof-of-concept study for ALXN1007 in patients with GI-GVHD.
Beyond our existing clinical and preclinical programs, we continue to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates as the year proceeds.
I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?"

Regarding manufacturing, we were well on track to be able to provide all of the patients that we intend to serve, obviously, ready for -- as we would expect a first half in 2015 launch in the U.S. and Germany. As it relates to patient numbers, I'll just sort of walk you through. We've had a study -- the 10 study that has remained open and that has enabled some patients with HPP to access treatment, even after we had locked all of our databases associated with all of our clinical trials and utilized that for the submission to the U.S., EU and Japanese authorities. And as we look at 2015, U.S. and Germany first half of the year, and then Japan, near year-end. The challenging thing is, and as you've said, it's difficult to pinpoint the patient numbers given the very low incidence of the disease, and then of course, the very high mortality rate in the youngest patients with HPP and mortality rate of about 70% at 3 years. So as we look at the launch and the overall opportunity, we have very strong conviction on this opportunity to dramatically improve the lives and save the lives of patients who suffer from HPP, but it's something that I think is going to take some time. I think it will be a steady trajectory at approval, and we will buildout the portfolio over time."

And so when we look at our breakthrough therapy designation and the approach that we're taking with the onset of disease with regulators, we would anticipate being able to hopefully serve those adults with severe disease.

In Q4, the global Alexion team drove a strong conclusion to 2014 as we advance our relentless mission to provide transformative therapies to patients with severe and life-threatening disorders.
During Q4, our commercial organization again provided Soliris to an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our operations in 50 countries. Our development teams made continued and strong progress in the quarter, notably with the completion of the rolling submission of our BLA for asfotase alfa in the United States and also our submission in Japan.
Importantly, we reported the advancement of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules into the clinic, and based on initial clinical data, at least one of these molecules will advance into Phase II PNH trials this year. And finally, we expect another year of strong financial performance in 2015. Equally important, we now are pleased to announce that we expect significant improvements in both our 2015 and longer-term effective tax rates compared to previous guidance.
Our accomplishments throughout 2014 position us to reach a new set of significant milestones on behalf of patients this year and beyond. By every measure, Alexion is at the strongest and most promising point in our history. Our commercial and financial performance are at record levels. Our potential to deliver new therapies to patients is greater than ever, and we have a world-class team of talented and dedicated colleagues at every level of the organization.
Thus, I'm confident that the time is right for the company and for me, personally, to complete our planned leadership transition as we announced this morning. The Board and I are delighted that David Hallal will become our second CEO. David has been instrumental in driving our results and in shaping our high-performance culture. He has demonstrated outstanding leadership at Alexion playing a principal role in leading many of the company's key initiatives on behalf of patients, including the highly successful launches of Soliris for PNH and aHUS, while also driving the buildout of Alexion's 50-country operating platform.
Since joining Alexion 9 years ago, David's role has expanded across the entire organization. And over the last several years, he and I have increasingly shared responsibilities. Now is the right time for David to lead Alexion.
As Chairman, I look forward to continuing to contribute to Alexion as I guide the Board and advise the company on strategic matters.
I'll now turn both the company and the call over to David. David?"

I am deeply honored to become Alexion's next CEO. On behalf of the entire organization, I would like to thank Lenny for his extraordinary leadership in building Alexion into one of the most successful and innovative biotechnology companies",869,"Thanks, Lenny. I am deeply honored to become Alexion's next CEO. On behalf of the entire organization, I would like to thank Lenny for his extraordinary leadership in building Alexion into one of the most successful and innovative biotechnology companies in the world, developing a company-wide commitment to innovation, creating our patient-focused culture and instilling exquisite discipline and operational excellence that have driven our remarkable success over the last 2 decades.
I look forward to leading our dedicated and talented employees worldwide as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plan focused on developing and delivering innovative therapies for patients with devastating and life-threatening disorders.
As we close another record year in 2014 and as I look at the company today, I see more than $2 billion in revenues with far more growth ahead of us in our in-line businesses; the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, this year; the most robust pipeline in our history with 3 ongoing registration programs; and 4 additional highly innovative molecules in clinical development; global leadership and complement science to serve patients through the next 2 decades; a strong foundation for future growth, with an additional 17 preclinical development programs, spanning diverse modalities in therapeutic areas; and lastly, a balance sheet aligned with our strong growth objectives. We have never been better positioned to leverage our unique 50-country commercial platform to drive future product expansion.
Now turning to our performance in Q4. We advanced our mission by reaching significant milestones across our commercial and pipeline initiatives.
Looking first to PNH. Our performance in 2014 affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. Throughout 2014, as in prior years, we continue to identify a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories in which we have operated the longest. As we look at 2015, we have strong conviction in our PNH franchise, as we aim to serve many more patients around the world.
Turning to aHUS. We continue to observe a steady addition of new patients commencing Soliris treatment in the U.S. and Europe in 2014, while we made important progress in the early stages of our launch in Japan. Globally, the ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. As one measure in the U.S., now more than 3 years following their respective FDA approvals, more patients are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. In Europe, we are observing a similar trend in the earlier stages of our aHUS launch. These observations support our view that the incidence of aHUS is likely higher than PNH.
Looking at 2015 and beyond, we continue to see that the majority of our aHUS growth is ahead of us, supported by our strength in labels in the U.S. and Europe, which demonstrate the immediate and long-term benefit of early and sustained treatment for patients with aHUS.
Our experience with PNH and aHUS provides us with key learnings to support the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, for patients with HPP.
In 2014, we completed the regulatory filings in the U.S., EU and Japan and we expect approvals in all of these territories this year. This creates the potential to commence launches in the U.S. and Germany during the first half of 2015 and in Japan by year-end.
Asfotase alfa will be the first of as many as 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018. These include eculizumab, and DGF, NMO, MG, and AMR, one or more of our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules as well as cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A within the same period. As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, which Martin will discuss later in the call.
Looking briefly at our 2014 financial performance. For the full year, we achieved 38% revenue growth for 2014 in-year sales compared to 2013. We also demonstrated strong operational leverage with 57% EPS growth associated with in-year sales for 2014.
Turning to our 2015 guidance. We announced this morning our revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion despite currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we would expect an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. Robust growth for Soliris reflects strong underlying demand with the anticipated addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment year-on-year. Our revenue guidance also includes a small initial contribution from asfotase alfa.
We are pleased that even with our increased investment in our global infrastructure, including preparation for the launch of asfotase alfa, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins as compared to 2014.
Finally, and as Vikas will describe in more detail, we expect to see immediate improvements in both our 2015 effective tax rate and our long-term tax rate as compared to prior guidance.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"
347983,282568316,751635,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David.

In Q4, the steady increase in uptick of Soliris among PNH and aHUS patients in our core territories and newer markets resulted in strong revenue and EPS growth during the quarter and for the year.
Revenue in Q4 increased 36% year-on-year to $599 million despite the early signs of weakness in key FX currencies late in the quarter.
Turning to the full year. As noted in this morning's press release, 2014 in-year revenues of $2.15 billion, exclude $88 million related to reimbursement for prior year sales in France. Thus, for the full year 2014, in-year sales increased 38% compared to 2013. Excluding onetime 2014 price benefits, sales increased by approximately $500 million compared to 2013. By exceeding our revenue target while maintaining strict financial discipline in our growing commercial and clinical activities, we reported 2014 non-GAAP EPS of $5.21 per diluted share, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of $88 million in pre-2014 sales, EPS would be $4.84, an increase of 57%.
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end grew by nearly $450 million to $1.9 billion. We achieved these gains through strong positive cash flow from operations, which also enabled us to repurchase $300 million of our own shares during the year. As a result of that repurchase, our total shares outstanding for Q4 2014 were 204 million shares, nearly unchanged from Q4 2013.
I would now like to turn to our 2015 guidance. We are guiding 2015 total revenue in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. I would note that our 2015 revenue forecast assumes that key currencies remain at the current exchange rates through the year. As a result, and reflecting that 2/3 of our revenues are outside of the U.S,  our 2015 revenue guidance includes a negative FX impact of approximately 5% of revenues or $135 million after hedging.
On a constant currency basis, without this 5% impact, our total revenue forecast in 2015 would have been greater than $2.7 billion, which would represent an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. This forecast reflects our expectation of continued strong growth at Soliris with expected addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as a small initial asfotase alfa contribution.
Turning to Q1 revenue. I would like to note that the increasingly negative sequential FX impact during Q1 combined with 2 fewer days are expected to result in Q1 revenues in the range of $585 million to $590 million.
Looking at other elements of our 2015 guidance, I will highlight the following: First, cost of goods is expected to increase in the second half of the year, as we launch asfotase alfa, which will have higher cost of goods than Soliris; Second, despite the FX headwinds and our continued investment in our global infrastructure for the asfotase alfa launch, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins compared to 2014; Third, we see the benefit of our further improvement in our effective tax rates. Our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 7% to 9%, lower than our previous forecast of 13% to 15%. This benefit results from entering 2015 with a higher level of tax credits remaining than we previously expected.
In addition, beyond 2015, we will continue to benefit from a reduced tax rate compared to our prior guidance. We now anticipate that our tax rate will be 12% to 13% in 2016, and 14% to 16% in 2017 and subsequent years.
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been approximately $0.30 higher.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In 2014, our R&D teams made important progress in our mission to serve more patients with devastating and rare diseases. I am very pleased that we surpassed our goal of achieving 10 development milestones over the year.
Looking to 2015, I would like to update you on our lead development programs as we drive towards our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.
First, asfotase alfa, our highly innovative potential therapy for patients with HPP. As David mentioned, we continue to expect decisions in the U.S. and EU in the first half of 2015 followed by a decision in Japan by the end of the year. We are working with regulatory authorities to obtain these marketing authorizations as quickly as possible, given the high rates of mortality, severe debilitating effects and current lack of any approved therapy for patients with HPP.
We continue to build the growing body of clinical data reflecting the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. In early March, at the Endocrine Society meeting, new data will be presented showing rapid and continued improvements in muscle strength, significant gains in physical function and reduction in pain in children receiving asfotase alfa for up to 3 years. Importantly, new Burden of Disease Data in Adults with HPP will also be presented at ENDO, and we plan to start a clinical study with asfotase alfa in adult patients with severe HPP in 2015.
I would now like to turn to our development programs with eculizumab beginning with our 3 multinational registration trials of eculizumab in delayed graft function, neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis. We expect to complete enrollment in our DGF trial in kidney transplant patients at increased risk for rejection and early graft loss by the end of the year.
In our neurology programs with eculizumab, in Q4, we were pleased that Soliris was granted orphan drug designations in Japan for both the treatment of patients with NMO and MG. In our registration trial in relapsing NMO, the PREVENT study, enrollment and dosing are ongoing. In our registration trial in refractory MG, the REGAIN study, we expect to complete enrollment in this study this year.
As the leaders in complement biology, we advanced our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014. As we announced on the Q3 call, we initiated Phase I studies of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules, ALXN1210 and ALXN5500, with additional molecules and programs in our expanding portfolio at earlier stages of development. The data already support advancing both of these molecules into further trials, and we intend to progress at least one of them into a Phase II PNH trial this year with additional indications likely to follow. ALXN1210 is a longer acting anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, suitable for once monthly dosing. We are targeting approval of at least one next generation candidate in 2018.
We also have lead development programs with 2 additional highly innovative therapies, ALXN1007 and cPMP. We have commenced dosing in 2 Phase II proof-of-concept studies to validate the safety and tolerability of ALXN1007 in patients with 2 severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases: graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVH, and antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. We expect to have interim data in the GI-GVHD study later in 2015.
In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A. The synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study.
Within our portfolio of 17 preclinical programs to drive future growth, I would like to turn briefly to our collaboration with Moderna, where we have initiated preclinical development in our first 7 mRNA rare disease programs and are targeting our first candidate to enter the clinic in 2016.
As we build on our accomplishments in 2014, we are well-positioned to achieve at least 12 development milestones across our pipelines in 2015. These include the U.S., EU and Japan approvals of asfotase alfa; the initiation of a study evaluating asfotase alfa in adults with severe HPP; the completion of enrollment in the DGF and MG registration trials; the initiation of a company-sponsored clinical study with eculizumab for the treatment of AMR as well as data from the Phase II deceased donor study for the prevention of AMR; completion of the Phase I next-generation Soliris studies for the first 2 molecules; and the initiation of a Phase II study for one or more of these molecules in PNH patients; and interim data from the Phase II proof-of-concept study for ALXN1007 in patients with GI-GVHD.
Beyond our existing clinical and preclinical programs, we continue to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates as the year proceeds.

As it relates to patient numbers, I'll just sort of walk you through. We've had a study, the 1010 study, that has remained open and that has enabled some patients with HPP to access treatment, even after we had locked all of our databases associated with all of our clinical trials and utilized that for the submission to the U.S., EU and Japanese authorities. And as we look at 2015, U.S. and Germany first half of the year, and then Japan, near year-end. The challenging thing is, and as you've said, it's difficult to pinpoint the patient numbers given the very low incidence of the disease, and then of course, the very high mortality rate in the youngest patients with HPP and mortality rate of about 70% at 3 years. So as we look at the launch and the overall opportunity, we have very strong conviction on this opportunity to dramatically improve the lives and save the lives of patients who suffer from HPP, but it's something that I think is going to take some time. I think it will be a steady trajectory at approval, and we will buildout the portfolio over time."

In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015.

In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015. As we executed on an expanding and unprecedented range of opportunities, to provide life transforming therapies to patients, with rare and devastating disorders.
During the quarter, our commercial organization delivered leveraging our world-class expertise and rare diseases, to serve more patients with both PNH and aHUS. This resulted in a 25% increase in revenues and a 31% increase in volume year-on-year. And our R&D team continued to advance the broadest pipeline in our company's history, driving toward as many as 7 new indication or product approvals through 2018, starting with asfotase alfa, which we will launch globally under the brand name Strensiq. 
Looking at our operating performance, with a strong addition of new patients receiving Soliris in Q1, and with the expected continued growth across our 50-country platform, we are reiterating our 2015 revenue and EPS guidance, despite increased currency headwinds, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core business.
Looking more closely at our PNH franchise, in Q1, as in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the 3 territories in which we have operated the longest, as well as in other key markets, such as Turkey and Brazil.
The success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients, newly starting on Soliris, are also newly diagnosed.
Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, our global launch continued to progress. In Q1, we again added a consistent number of new aHUS patients on Soliris treatment. Match for time, 14 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval. The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve rations with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.
Given that the incidents of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect this trend to continue and perhaps even widen.
As we strive to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS, we will now be aided by the recent strengthening of the Soliris label in Europe. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved key updates to the legal, which includes important information to help optimize care for patients.
In PNH, the updated label confirms that patients with homolisis are at high risk of morbidities and premature mortality regardless of whether they have received the blood transfusion. This is important because many patients suffering from PNH do not require transfusions. The label update now guidance physicians that this additional group of patients will also benefit from Soliris treatment.
For aHUS, the updated label informs physicians that the longer-term Soliris treatment helps a greater proportion of patients experienced clinically meaningful improvements. Importantly, the revised label underscores the risk of taking patients off of Soliris, stating that severe complications of thrombotic, or TMA, were observed as early as 1 month following discontinuation of Soliris treatment. Further, the EU label now includes clinical experience for patients, who discontinued Soliris, showing that monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent life-threatening complications including severe EMA and end-stage renal disease.
As our Soliris operations continued to grow, we are preparing to serve patients with HPP with our next product Strensiq. Since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies, and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible.
While the review processes continued to progress positively, we now do not expect the final decision will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter. In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of this year, the EC decision will come shortly thereafter.
In the U.S., Strensiq was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and our rolling BLA was accepted under priority review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies which strongly support our submission. Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses. Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year.
Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly. Following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near midyear, rather than our previous expectation of year end.
Importantly, our 2015 revenue guidance remains unchanged and we continued to expect an initial small revenue contribution from Strensiq in 2015. As we prepare for this global launch, we are completing the buildout of our in-country metabolic teams. Building on our highly successful experience with Soliris, these teams continue to establish relationships with the HPP community and our focused on expanding our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives as they educate physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP and the appropriate pathways for rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Once approved, Strensiq will be the first of as many 7 new indications or product approvals for patients with severe and rare diseases through 2018. To achieve this goal, we are advancing the broadest pipeline in our history, including our late-stage programs, with 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in MG, NMO and DGF and 4 additional highly innovative molecules in Clinical Development. 
Expanding on our global leadership and complement, our objective is to develop and deliver multiple innovative therapies for patients, suffering from a wide range of complement mediated diseases.
In Q1, we strengthened and broadened our portfolio of highly innovative complement inhibitors, the 7 molecules across diversed platform. 3 of these molecules are already in Clinical Development. This includes the first 2 of our next-generation Soliris molecules, ALXN 12 10, a longer acting antibody suitable for monthly dosing and ALXN 5500. We are driving toward an expected approval of at least 1 of these molecules in 2018.
We are also developing ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which targets C5A. Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience and complement biology to progress an additional 4 preclinical programs, 2 of which we added through strategic license agreements in Q1.
Our future growth is also supported by a couple of 17 preclinical programs, spanning diversed disease mechanisms, delivery modalities and therapeutic areas, all of which target devastating and rare diseases.
As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, and we'll provide more detailed in our pipeline later in the call.
Looking briefly at our Q1 financial performance, we reported revenues of $600 million, reflecting 25% in year growth over Q1 2014, despite the continuing significant weakness in ex-U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter.
With this steady patient and volume growth in our core business, combined with our effective hedging program, we are reiterating our 2015 financial guidance. This guidance includes total revenues of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion.
On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year. We are also reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"

In Q1, we continued to deliver a strong financial performance, while increasing our investment in a long-term growth. First, the underlying strength in our core business has enabled us to reiterate our guidance this morning, despite the further weakening of global currencies, notably the euro, which has fallen from $1.18 when we provided our initial forecast to $1.07 today.
Our Q1 2015 revenues of $600 million were above our forecast of $585 million to $590 million, reflecting 25% growth of in-year sales over Q1 2014. This 25% revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 6.6% currency headwind in Q1 over the year-ago quarter, net of hedging.
The strength of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in R&D and SG&A as we drive to broaden our product portfolio. In this regard, our R&D investment in the quarter reflected the continued progress of our late-stage pipeline and the broadening of our portfolio of early stage assets. SG&A in Q1 reflected the ongoing buildout of our global operations in preparation for the Strensiq launch.
Turning now to EPS. We achieved Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.28 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of $24 million charge, or $0.11 per share, associated with a single manufacturing camp in Strensiq, unrelated to launch inventory, EPS would have been $1.39.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During Q1, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations, which was offset by 2 factors: First, we are $112 million in payments related to 3 strategic license agreements; second, we purchased approximately $16 million of our shares as we continue to mitigate the natural pace of stock dilution from equity grants. As a reminder, we have an ongoing share repurchase program of $500 million. 
I would now like to review some aspects of our 2015 guidance. Foreign currencies have continued to weaken since we provided our guidance in January. With roughly 2/3 of our revenue from ex-U.S. countries, the full year impact of foreign exchange to our total revenue is now expected to be approximately 6%, or $106 million -- $160 million, compared to our previous expectation of 5% or $135 million, net of hedging.
Despite this increase in currency headwinds, we are reiterating our 2015 total revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth in our PNH and aHUS operations globally and our effective hedging program. This 2015 guidance includes a small initial revenue contribution from Strensiq. On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing revenue growth of 27% year-on-year.
Now looking specifically at the Q2, we anticipate continued to strong volume growth and expect revenues to be in the range of $625 million to $630 million, despite continued FX headwinds of approximately $40 million compared to Q2 2014. 
Looking now at other elements of our guidance, I will highlight the following 2 points: Due to the strength of our underlying core business, we are reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80, despite increased FX headwinds and the impact of the manufacturing charge in Q1; and, cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guidance range of 8% to 9%.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In the first quarter of 2015, our R&D teams advanced the most robust pipeline in our company's history, driving toward our goal of achieving up to 7 new indicational product approvals through 2018, beginning with Strensiq, our noble therapy for patients with HPP this year.
As David mentioned, since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and the EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies, and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible. While a review process is continued to progress positively, we now do not expect that the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter.
In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of the year, the easy decision will come shortly thereafter. In the U.S., Strensiq was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and our rolling BLA was accepted on the priority review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies which strongly support our submission. Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses.
Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year. Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly, following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near midyear, rather than our previous expectation of year end.
As we prepare for our 2015 global launch of Strensiq, recent clinical data continue to reflect the devastating nature of HPP and the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. Building on the strong survival data in infants, which showed a 5-year survival rate of 89% with asfotase alfa, compared to 27% in untreated historical controls, we also recently presented data showing the devastating impact HPP has on juveniles and the transformative benefits of asfotase alfa for these patients.
In early March, data from the first natural history study in juveniles with HPP represented in a late breaking session at Society meeting. In the study, children with juvenile onset HPP experienced significant impairment in walking, debilitating muscle weakness, severe pain, skeletal deformities, and frequent fractures. These data underscore the urgent need for a transformative treatment for these patients.
New data from the ongoing asfotase alfa Phase II studies, in which patients are treated for at least 3 years, provide long-term efficacy data, showing sustained significant improvement in pain, strength agility and growth, as well as normalization of physical function in children with HPP.
To further strengthen and broaden the clinical data in HPP over time, we are also finalizing the protocol for a clinical study of asfotase alfa in adults with HPP, which will commence later this year.
Beyond asfotase alfa, we continued to make meaningful progress with our late-stage pipeline, including 3 multinational registration studies with eculizumab in other severe and mediated disorders, which lack approval or effective therapies.
Starting with neurology, enrollment in dosing are ongoing in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. Despite the best support of care, patients who suffer from Refractory MG experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness over the arms and legs, and difficulty breathing. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year.
Enrollment in dosing are ongoing in the PREVENT study, our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO. Despite beset support of care, patients continued to experience disabling or life-threatening attacks. Each new relapse or attack brings a risk of a devastating outcome, including blindness, paralysis, respiratory failure or premature death. We are working diligently with investigators globally to complete enrollment in this study next year.
In kidney transplant, we continued to enroll patients in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in the delayed graft function, or DGF. This is a debilitating condition in which the transplanted organ does not initially function properly, which can result in rejection or early graft loss. In addition, due to the associated with DGF, 15% to 20% of donor kidneys are discarded each year, reducing the already limited supply of donor organs. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year.
As the global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus on innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating competent mediated diseases. In Q1, we strengthened and broaden our portfolio of complement inhibitors to now include 7 molecules across diversed platforms. 3 of these molecules are already in Clinical Development. 
ALXN1210, a longer acting ADAC 5 antibody, suitable for monthly dosing, and ALXN5500, the first of our next-generation Soliris molecule. We are advancing Phase I study of these first molecule, and we'll progress at least 1 into our Phase II PNH trial this year, with additional indications likely to follow. We are targeting approval of at least 1 of these molecules in 2018.
We are also developing ALXN1007, our normalized inflammatory antibody to C5D, which is an attractive target, given a specific role in a number of complement mediated disorders. We are currently conducting Phase II studies with the ALXN1007, in patients with too severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases. Antiphospholipid, or EPS, and graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI, GVHD.
Severe GI GVHD is an obstacle to successful stem cell transplant with significant mortality within the first 100 days post-transplant. We continued to expect to have interim data in the GI study later in 2015.
Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience in complement biology to progress an additional 4 preclinical programs, 2 of which we added through strategic investments in Q1.
In our metabolic disease area, we continued to advance our cPMP replacement therapy, a small molecule approach to the treatment of patients with deficiency type A, rapidly progressing these of VCs afflicting newborns. This synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015.
We are also continuing our retrospective data election and natural history study. Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on our expanding pipeline, driven by both internal at acquired preclinical programs. As such, we are advancing our portfolio of 17 programs, including those resulting from our collaboration with Madera, where, in the first year, we have initiated preclinical developments in 7 mRNA rare disease programs, and our targeting our first 2 enter the clinic in 2016.
In Q1, we continued to collaborate with Vanderbilt University, to build on the preclinical data showing the potential of asfotase alfa, as a treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, I devastating disease in which excess PTI may play a role as it does in HPP.
While the existing research in this area is at a very early stage, we look over to further exploring this potential second use of asfotase alfa and are planning to enter the clinic in 2016.
As we look to build upon our robust pipeline, we completed a transaction with blueprint medicines, to discover, develop and commercialize novel drug candidate for an activated kinase target, that is the cost of our rare genetic disease. This is a very promising approach as they already have molecules with impressive selectivity towards the target kinase.
We are continuing to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates on all of our programs as the year proceeds.
I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

At the same time, we highlighted last quarter, our expectation is to serve patients with complement mediated diseases through the end of this decade and through the end of next.

It's a great question. I'd say in the U.S., of course, the first country in which we launched Soliris for PNH back in April '07, is that today, we see ourselves are starting to approach sort of that point where we are getting to identifying about 1/2 of the patients that may have the disease. And around the world, globally, slightly less than that, as we launch later in those other territories. I'd say, Jeff, 1 of the things that we're benefiting from, of course, is that we see that Soliris helps to change that natural history of disease, where aided by the fact that there is an incidence rate, albeit not as high as aHUS, but there is an incidence rate for PNH, that means new patients coming into the system every year and the symptoms associated with PNH still continue to resemble symptoms of more common bone marrow failure syndromes or clouding disorders. And based upon that, physicians just missed these patients. And we want to get there fast, with a 35% death rate at 5 years. And so we think all of that combined puts us in a really good position and we see, as we presented previously, a continued steady identification of new patients across our 50-country platform. In 2015, same steady contribution of new patients on a quarterly basis, as we did in the earlier stages of the launch. In terms of PNH versus aHUS, as I indicated, 14 quarters out now, following the FDA approval, there are more patients actively on treatment with Soliris for aHUS. We think the success of the legacy programs, combined with the higher incidents and of course, these patients with aHUS are presenting urgently, high degree of medical severity, including renal impairment or renal failure, and that is actually helping us to diagnose patients faster, but we still think there's a number of patients we missed that we think there' is great upside in the U.S. and around the world to reach more physicians with those disease and diagnostic initiatives to get to those patients sooner."

As you know, we started out with our U.S. and European labels with only 6 months of efficacy data, that is now moved to 2 years and beyond. And we believe that this update, which also provides specific clinical evidence of patients that were discontinued and monitored closely over time, still had a very bad devastating outcome including specifically of patient progressing to ESRD.

I guess at this time, wasn't that a question for everybody, but why don't I take them. A way to think about aHUS as we've always said, obviously, the disease is devastating to both children and adults, but when you look at the mix of patients, the way to think about our aHUS franchises, the average per patient dose across the population, think about it as it fits right into PNH, right, when you balance out the children and the adults. In terms of patient in or out the hospital setting, we think about patients 2 ways: The patients with active progressing PMA, to the most I'm referring to that are presenting urgently, usually the hospital because their platelets are plummeting, their pH is rising, they have symptoms of hemolysis and of course, their kidneys are greatly impaired or failing. And so, we see the majority of patients that we identify and starting on the with our at that level. At the same time, there are patients that have perhaps absorbed a history of thrombotic microangiopathy. That might be out in the clinic with nephrologists and hematologists. And again, as part of the levers that we have with our field team that also focuses on PNH, where most of the PNH patients are actually identified in the hematology clinic. So that leverage actually allows us to both capture the opportunity to serve patients in the hospital, as well as out in the clinics.

In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015 as we executed on an expanding and unprecedented range of opportunities to provide life-transforming therapies to patients with rare and devastating disorders.During the",1295,"Thank you, Irving. In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015 as we executed on an expanding and unprecedented range of opportunities to provide life-transforming therapies to patients with rare and devastating disorders.
During the quarter, our commercial organization delivered, leveraging our world-class expertise in rare diseases, to serve more patients with both PNH and aHUS. This resulted in a 25% increase in revenues and a 31% increase in volume year-on-year. And our R&D team continued to advance the broadest pipeline in our company's history, driving toward as many as 7 new indication or product approvals through 2018, starting with asfotase alfa, which we will launch globally under the brand name Strensiq.
Looking at our operating performance, with a strong addition of new patients receiving Soliris in Q1 and with the expected continued growth across our 50-country platform, we are reiterating our 2015 revenue and EPS guidance despite increased currency headwinds, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core business.
Looking more closely at our PNH franchise in Q1, as in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the 3 territories in which we have operated the longest as well as in other key markets such as Turkey and Brazil. The success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, our global launch continued to progress. In Q1, we again added a consistent number of new aHUS patients on Soliris treatment. Match for time, 14 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval. The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidents of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect this trend to continue and perhaps even widen.
As we strive to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS, we will now be aided by the recent strengthening of the Soliris label in Europe. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved key updates to the label, which includes important information to help optimize care for patients.
In PNH, the updated label confirms that patients with hemolysis are at high risk of morbidities and premature mortality regardless of whether they have received the blood transfusion. This is important because many patients suffering from PNH do not require transfusions. The label update now guides physicians that this additional group of patients will also benefit from Soliris treatment.
For aHUS, the updated label informs physicians that the longer-term Soliris treatment helps a greater proportion of patients experience clinically meaningful improvements. Importantly, the revised label underscores the risk of taking patients off of Soliris, stating that severe complications of thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA, were observed as early as 1 month following discontinuation of Soliris treatment. Further, the EU label now includes clinical experience for patients who discontinued Soliris, showing that monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent life-threatening complications including severe TMA and end-stage renal disease.
As our Soliris operations continue to grow, we are preparing to serve patients with HPP with our next product Strensiq. Since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible.
While the review processes continue to progress positively, we now do not expect the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter. In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of this year, the EC decision will come shortly thereafter.
In the U.S., Strensiq was granted breakthrough therapy designation, and our rolling BLA was accepted under priority review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies which strongly support our submission. Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses. Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year.
Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly. Following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near midyear, rather than our previous expectation of year end.
Importantly, our 2015 revenue guidance remains unchanged, and we continue to expect an initial small revenue contribution from Strensiq in 2015.
As we prepare for this global launch, we are completing the build out of our in-country metabolic teams. Building on our highly successful experience with Soliris, these teams continue to establish relationships with the HPP community and are focused on expanding our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives as they educate physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP and the appropriate pathways for rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Once approved, Strensiq will be the first of as many as 7 new indications or product approvals for patients with severe and rare diseases through 2018. To achieve this goal, we are advancing the broadest pipeline in our history, including our late-stage programs, with 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in MG, NMO and DGF and 4 additional highly innovative molecules in Clinical Development.
Expanding on our global leadership and complement, our objective is to develop and deliver multiple innovative therapies for patients suffering from a wide range of complement-mediated diseases.
In Q1, we strengthened and broadened our portfolio of highly innovative complement inhibitors, the 7 molecules across diversed platforms. Three of these molecules are already in Clinical Development. This includes the first 2 of our next-generation Soliris molecules: ALXN 1210, a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing; and ALXN 5500. We are driving toward an expected approval of at least one of these molecules in 2018.
We are also developing ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which targets C5a. Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience in complement biology to progress an additional 4 preclinical programs, 2 of which we added through strategic license agreements in Q1.
Our future growth is also supported by a total of 17 preclinical programs, spanning diversed disease mechanisms, delivery modalities in therapeutic areas, all of which target devastating and rare diseases.
As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, and we'll provide more details on our pipeline later in the call.
Looking briefly at our Q1 financial performance, we reported revenues of $600 million, reflecting 25% in year growth over Q1 2014 despite the continuing significant weakness in ex-U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter.
With this steady patient and volume growth in our core business, combined with our effective hedging program, we are reiterating our 2015 financial guidance. This guidance includes total revenues of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion.
On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year. We are also reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"

In Q1, we continued to deliver a strong financial performance, while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. First, the underlying strength in our core business has enabled us to reiterate our guidance this morning, despite the further weakening of global currencies, notably the euro, which has fallen from $1.18, when we provided our initial forecast, to $1.07 today.
Our Q1 2015 revenues of $600 million were above our forecast of $585 million to $590 million, reflecting 25% growth of in-year sales over Q1 2014. This 25% revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 6.6% currency headwind in Q1 over the year-ago quarter, net of hedging.
The strength of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in R&D and SG&A as we drive to broaden our product portfolio. In this regard, our R&D investment in the quarter reflected the continued progress of our late-stage pipeline and the broadening of our portfolio of early-stage assets. SG&A in Q1 reflected the ongoing build out of our global operations in preparation for the Strensiq launch.
Turning now to EPS. We achieved Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.28 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of $24 million charge or $0.11 per share, associated with a single manufacturing camp in Strensiq, unrelated to launch inventory, EPS would have been $1.39.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During Q1, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations, which was offset by 2 factors: first, we had $112 million in upfront payments related to 3 strategic license agreements; second, we purchased approximately $16 million of our shares as we continue to mitigate the natural pace of stock dilution from equity grants. As a reminder, we have an ongoing share repurchase program of $500 million.
I would now like to review some aspects of our 2015 guidance. Foreign currencies have continued to weaken since we provided our guidance in January. With roughly 2/3 of our revenue from ex-U.S. countries, the full year impact of foreign exchange to our total revenue is now expected to be approximately 6% or $106 million -- $160 million, compared to our previous expectation of 5% or $135 million net of hedging.
Despite these increasing currency headwinds, we are reiterating our 2015 total revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth in our PNH and aHUS operations globally and our effective hedging program. This 2015 guidance includes a small initial revenue contribution from Strensiq. On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year.
Now looking specifically at the Q2, we anticipate continued strong volume growth and expect revenues to be in the range of $625 million to $630 million, despite continued FX headwinds of approximately $40 million compared to Q2 2014.
Looking now at other elements of our guidance, I will highlight the following 2 points: due to the strength of our underlying core business, we are reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80, despite increased FX headwinds and the impact of the manufacturing charge in Q1; and cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guidance range of 8% to 9%.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In the first quarter of 2015, our R&D teams advanced the most robust pipeline in our company's history, driving toward our goal of achieving up to 7 new indicational product approvals through 2018, beginning with Strensiq, our noble therapy for patients with HPP this year.
As David mentioned, since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and the EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies, and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible. While our review processes continue to progress positively, we now do not expect that the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter.
In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of the year, the EC decision will come shortly thereafter. In the U.S., Strensiq was granted breakthrough therapy designation, and our rolling BLA was accepted under priority review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies, which strongly support our submission. Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses. Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year.
Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly, following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near midyear rather than our previous expectation of year end.
As we prepare for our 2015 global launch of Strensiq, recent clinical data continue to reflect the devastating nature of HPP and the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. Building on the strong survival data in infants, which showed a 5-year survival rate of 89% with asfotase alfa compared to 27% in untreated historical controls, we also recently presented data showing the devastating impact HPP has on juveniles and the transformative benefits of asfotase alfa for these patients.
In early March, data from the first natural history study in juveniles with HPP represented in a late-breaking session at Endocrine Society meeting. In this study, children with juvenile onset HPP experienced significant impairments in walking, debilitating muscle weakness, severe pain, skeletal deformities and frequent fractures. These data underscore the urgent need for a transformative treatment for these patients.
New data from the ongoing asfotase alfa Phase II studies, in which patients are treated for at least 3 years, provide long-term efficacy data, showing sustained significant improvement in pain, strength, agility and growth as well as normalization of physical function in children with HPP.
To further strengthen and broaden the clinical data in HPP over time, we are also finalizing the protocol for a clinical study of asfotase alfa in adults with HPP, which will commence later this year.
Beyond asfotase alfa, we continue to make meaningful progress with our late-stage pipeline, including 3 multinational registration studies with eculizumab in other severe and rare complement-mediated disorders, which lack approved or effective therapies.
Starting with neurology, enrollment and dosing are ongoing in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. Despite best support of care, patients who suffer from refractory MG experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness over the arms and legs, and difficulty breathing. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year.
Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in the PREVENT study, our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO. Despite best support of care, patients continue to experience disabling or life-threatening attacks. Each new relapse or attack brings a risk of a devastating outcome, including blindness, paralysis, respiratory failure or premature death. We are working diligently with investigators globally to complete enrollment in this study next year.
In kidney transplant, we continue to enroll patients in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in the delayed graft function, or DGF. This is a debilitating condition in which a transplanted organ does not initially function properly, which can result in rejection or early graft loss. In addition, due to the poor outcomes associated with DGF, 15% to 20% of donor kidneys are discarded each year, reducing the already limited supply of donor organs. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year.
As the global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus on innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating competent-mediated diseases. In Q1, we strengthened and broaden our portfolio of complement inhibitors to now include 7 molecules across diverse platforms. Three of these molecules are already in Clinical Development.
ALXN 1210, a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing, and ALXN 5500, the first of our next-generation Soliris molecules. We are advancing Phase I study of these first molecules, and we'll progress at least one into our Phase II PNH trial this year, with additional indications likely to follow. We are targeting approval of at least one of these molecules in 2018.
We are also developing ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody to C5a, which is an attractive target given its specific role in a number of complement-mediated disorders. We are currently conducting Phase II studies with the ALXN 1007 in patients with too severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases: Antiphospholipid syndrome, or APS; and graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVHD. Severe GI-GVHD is an obstacle to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplants, with significant mortality within the first 100 days post-transplant. We continue to expect to have interim data in the GI-GVHD study later in 2015.
Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience in complement biology to progress an additional 4 preclinical programs, 2 of which we added through strategic investments in Q1.
In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP replacement therapy, a small molecule approach to the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. The synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on our expanding pipeline, driven by both internal at acquired preclinical programs. As such, we are advancing our portfolio of 17 programs, including those resulting from our collaboration with Moderna, where in the first year, we have initiated preclinical development in 7 mRNA rare disease programs and are targeting our first to enter the clinic in 2016.
In Q1, we continued to collaborate with Vanderbilt University to build on the preclinical data showing the potential of asfotase alfa as a treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role as it does in HPP. While the existing research in this area is at a very early stage, we look forward to further exploring this potential second use of asfotase alfa and are planning to enter the clinic in 2016.
As we look to build upon our robust pipeline, we completed a transaction with Blueprint Medicines to discover, develop and commercialize novel drug candidate for an activated kinase target that is a cause of a rare genetic disease. This is a very promising approach as they already have molecules with impressive selectivity toward the target kinase.
We are continuing to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates on all of our programs as the year proceeds.
I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

It's a great question. I'd say in the U.S., of course, the first country in which we launched Soliris for PNH back in April '07, is that today, we see ourselves are starting to approach sort of that point where we think we're getting to identifying about half of the patients that may have the disease. And around the world, globally, slightly less than that, as we launched later in those other territories. I'd say, Geoff, one of the things that we're benefiting from, of course, is that we see that Soliris helps to change that natural history of disease. We're aided by the fact that there is an incidence rate, albeit not as high as aHUS, but there is an incidence rate for PNH. That means new patients are coming into the system every year. And the symptoms associated with PNH still continue to resemble symptoms of more common bone marrow failure syndromes or clotting disorders. And based upon that, physicians just missed these patients. And we want to get there fast, with a 35% death rate at 5 years. And so we think all of that combined puts us in a really good position. And we see, as we presented previously, a continued steady identification of new patients across our 50-country platform. In 2015, same steady contribution of new patients on a quarterly basis, as we did in the earlier stages of the launch. In terms of PNH versus aHUS, as I indicated, 14 quarters out now following the FDA approval, there are more patients actively on treatment with Soliris for aHUS. And we think the success of the diagnostic programs, combined with the higher incidents -- and of course these patients with aHUS are presenting urgently a high degree of medical severity, including renal impairment or renal failure, and that is actually helping us to diagnose patients faster. But we still think there's a number of patients we missed. But we think there's great upside in the U.S. and around the world to reach more physicians with those disease and diagnostic initiatives to get to those patients sooner."

As we have indicated on past calls, we observed that the persistency for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS is good, but less than that of the historically observed, a very, very, very high rate in PNH. And I think though, the thing that I've characterized in the past is given that aHUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy and there are a few thrombotic microangiopathies that are viewed as more of a short-term intermittent disease. One key part of our educational program, over time, has been that aHUS is a genetic lifelong disease, as opposed to say, for example, STEC-HUS. And so over time, we think physicians are gaining a better appreciation. As you know, we started out with our U.S. and European labels with only 6 months of efficacy data, that is now moved to 2 years and beyond. And we believe that this update, which also provides specific clinical evidence of patients that were discontinued and monitored closely over time, still had a very bad devastating outcome including specifically a patient progressing to ESRD. So we think both the longer-term efficacy data showing that more patients have a clinically meaningful improvement on Soliris treatment, combined with also the protection from the risk of severe devastating thrombotic microangiopathy, is going to continue to support our efforts with physicians around the world."

I guess this time, it wasn't a question for everybody, but why don't I take them. A way to think about aHUS as we've always said, obviously, the disease is devastating to both children and adults. But when you look at the mix of patients -- the way to think about our aHUS franchise is the average per patient dose across the population, think about it as it fits right into PNH, right, when you balance out the children and the adults. In terms of patients in or out of the hospital setting, we think about patients 2 ways. The patients with active progressing PMA. They're the ones that I'm referring to that are presenting urgently, usually to a hospital, because their platelets are plummeting, their LVH is rising, they have symptoms of hemolysis and, of course, their kidneys are greatly impaired or failing. And so we see the majority of the patients that we identify and starting on treatment are at that level. But at the same time, there are patients that have perhaps absorbed a history of thrombotic microangiopathy. That might be out in the clinics with nephrologists and hematologists. And again, that's part of the leverage that we have with our field team that also focuses on PNH, where most of the PNH patients are actually identified in the hematology clinic. So that leverage actually allows us to both capture the opportunity to serve patients in the hospital as well as out in the clinics. And then I think your last question, and Martin can certainly add to this, the questions that we're getting from regulators, I think as Eric pointed out, would just be kind of straightforward questions that we would expect in the normal course of the process but with us standing by the transformative impact. You've seeing the data at medical congresses with patients treated for 3 to 5 years and really standing by that submission to make sure that we can serve the highest number of patients possible."

When you look at it on a time adjusted basis, 14 quarters in on the U.S., the fact that we're actively treating more patients for aHUS than PNH, combined with the higher incidents, right? So we didn't get there through pent-up demand, we've gotten there through serving patients who are newly presenting with PMA over time.

347983,290805826,793293,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Irving. In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015 as we executed on an expanding and unprecedented range of opportunities to provide life-transforming therapies to patients with rare and devastating disorders.During the",1295,"Thank you, Irving. In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015 as we executed on an expanding and unprecedented range of opportunities to provide life-transforming therapies to patients with rare and devastating disorders.
During the quarter, our commercial organization delivered, leveraging our world-class expertise in rare diseases, to serve more patients with both PNH and aHUS. This resulted in a 25% increase in revenues and a 31% increase in volume year-on-year. And our R&D team continued to advance the broadest pipeline in our company's history, driving toward as many as 7 new indication or product approvals through 2018, starting with asfotase alfa, which we will launch globally under the brand name Strensiq.
Looking at our operating performance, with a strong addition of new patients receiving Soliris in Q1 and with the expected continued growth across our 50-country platform, we are reiterating our 2015 revenue and EPS guidance, despite increased currency headwinds, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core business.
Looking more closely at our PNH franchise in Q1, as in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the 3 territories in which we have operated the longest, as well as in other key markets such as Turkey and Brazil. The success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, our global launch continued to progress. In Q1, we again added a consistent number of new aHUS patients on Soliris treatment. Match for time, 14 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval. The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidents of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect this trend to continue and perhaps even widen.
As we strive to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS, we will now be aided by the recent strengthening of the Soliris label in Europe. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved key updates to the label, which includes important information to help optimize care for patients.
In PNH, the updated label confirms that patients with hemolysis are at high risk of morbidities and premature mortality regardless of whether they have received a blood transfusion. This is important because many patients suffering from PNH do not require transfusions. The label update now guides physicians that this additional group of patients will also benefit from Soliris treatment.
For aHUS, the updated label informs physicians that the longer-term Soliris treatment helps a greater proportion of patients experience clinically meaningful improvements. Importantly, the revised label underscores the risks of taking patients off of Soliris, stating that severe complications of thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA, were observed as early as 1 month following discontinuation of Soliris treatment. Further, the EU label now includes clinical experience for patients who discontinued Soliris, showing that monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent life-threatening complications including severe TMA and end-stage renal disease.
As our Soliris operations continue to grow, we are preparing to serve patients with HPP with our next product Strensiq. Since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible.
While the review processes continue to progress positively, we now do not expect the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter. In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of this year, the EC decision will come shortly thereafter.
In the U.S., Strensiq was granted breakthrough therapy designation, and our rolling BLA was accepted under priority review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies which strongly support our submission. Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses. Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year.
Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly. Following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near midyear, rather than our previous expectation of year end.
Importantly, our 2015 revenue guidance remains unchanged, and we continue to expect an initial small revenue contribution from Strensiq in 2015.
As we prepare for this global launch, we are completing the build out of our in-country metabolic teams. Building on our highly successful experience with Soliris, these teams continue to establish relationships with the HPP community and are focused on expanding our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives as they educate physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP and the appropriate pathways for rapid and accurate diagnosis.
Once approved, Strensiq will be the first of as many as 7 new indications or product approvals for patients with severe and rare diseases through 2018. To achieve this goal, we are advancing the broadest pipeline in our history, including our late-stage programs, with 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in MG, NMO and DGF and 4 additional highly innovative molecules in Clinical Development.
Expanding on our global leadership and complement, our objective is to develop and deliver multiple innovative therapies for patients suffering from a wide range of complement-mediated diseases.
In Q1, we strengthened and broadened our portfolio of highly innovative complement inhibitors, the 7 molecules across diversed platforms. Three of these molecules are already in Clinical Development. This includes the first 2 of our next-generation Soliris molecules: ALXN 1210, a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing; and ALXN 5500. We are driving toward an expected approval of at least one of these molecules in 2018.
We are also developing ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which targets C5a. Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience in complement biology to progress an additional 4 preclinical programs, 2 of which we added through strategic license agreements in Q1.
Our future growth is also supported by a total of 17 preclinical programs, spanning diversed disease mechanisms, delivery modalities in therapeutic areas, all of which target devastating and rare diseases.
As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, and we'll provide more details on our pipeline later in the call.
Looking briefly at our Q1 financial performance, we reported revenues of $600 million, reflecting 25% in year growth over Q1 2014 despite the continuing significant weakness in ex-U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter.
With this steady patient and volume growth in our core business, combined with our effective hedging program, we are reiterating our 2015 financial guidance. This guidance includes total revenues of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion.
On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year. We are also reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"

In Q1, we continued to deliver a strong financial performance, while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. First, the underlying strength in our core business has enabled us to reiterate our guidance this morning, despite the further weakening of global currencies, notably the euro, which has fallen from $1.18, when we provided our initial forecast, to $1.07 today.
Our Q1 2015 revenues of $600 million were above our forecast of $585 million to $590 million, reflecting 25% growth of in-year sales over Q1 2014. This 25% revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 6.6% currency headwind in Q1 over the year-ago quarter, net of hedging.
The strength of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in R&D and SG&A as we drive to broaden our product portfolio. In this regard, our R&D investment in the quarter reflected the continued progress of our late-stage pipeline and the broadening of our portfolio of early-stage assets. SG&A in Q1 reflected the ongoing build out of our global operations in preparation for the Strensiq launch.
Turning now to EPS. We achieved Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.28 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of $24 million charge or $0.11 per share, associated with a single manufacturing camp in Strensiq, unrelated to launch inventory, EPS would have been $1.39.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During Q1, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations, which was offset by 2 factors: first, we had $112 million in upfront payments related to 3 strategic license agreements; second, we purchased approximately $16 million of our shares as we continue to mitigate the natural pace of stock dilution from equity grants. As a reminder, we have an ongoing share repurchase program of $500 million.
I would now like to review some aspects of our 2015 guidance. Foreign currencies have continued to weaken since we provided our guidance in January. With roughly 2/3 of our revenue from ex-U.S. countries, the full year impact of foreign exchange to our total revenue is now expected to be approximately 6% or $106 million -- $160 million, compared to our previous expectation of 5% or $135 million net of hedging.
Despite these increasing currency headwinds, we are reiterating our 2015 total revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth in our PNH and aHUS operations globally and our effective hedging program. This 2015 guidance includes a small initial revenue contribution from Strensiq. On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year.
Now looking specifically at Q2, we anticipate continued strong volume growth and expect revenues to be in the range of $625 million to $630 million, despite continued FX headwinds of approximately $40 million compared to Q2 2014.
Looking now at other elements of our guidance, I will highlight the following 2 points: due to the strength of our underlying core business, we are reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80, despite increased FX headwinds and the impact of the manufacturing charge in Q1; and cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guidance range of 8% to 9%.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In the first quarter of 2015, our R&D teams advanced the most robust pipeline in our company's history, driving toward our goal of achieving up to 7 new indication or product approvals through 2018, beginning with Strensiq, our noble therapy for patients with HPP this year.
As David mentioned, since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and the EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies, and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible. While the review processes continue to progress positively, we now do not expect that the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter.

Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly, following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near midyear rather than our previous expectation of year end.
As we prepare for our 2015 global launch of Strensiq, recent clinical data continue to reflect the devastating nature of HPP and the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. Building on the strong survival data in infants, which showed a 5-year survival rate of 89% with asfotase alfa compared to 27% in untreated historical controls, we also recently presented data showing the devastating impact HPP has on juveniles and the transformative benefits of asfotase alfa for these patients.
In early March, data from the first natural history study in juveniles with HPP represented in a late-breaking session at Endocrine Society meeting. In this study, children with juvenile onset HPP experienced significant impairments in walking, debilitating muscle weakness, severe pain, skeletal deformities and frequent fractures. These data underscore the urgent need for a transformative treatment for these patients.
New data from the ongoing asfotase alfa Phase II studies, in which patients were treated for at least 3 years, provide long-term efficacy data, showing sustained significant improvement in pain, strength, agility and growth as well as normalization of physical function in children with HPP.
To further strengthen and broaden the clinical data in HPP over time, we are also finalizing the protocol for a clinical study of asfotase alfa in adults with HPP, which will commence later this year.
Beyond asfotase alfa, we continue to make meaningful progress with our late-stage pipeline, including 3 multinational registration studies with eculizumab in other severe and rare complement-mediated disorders, which lack approved or effective therapies.
Starting with neurology, enrollment and dosing are ongoing in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. Despite best supportive care, patients who suffer from refractory MG experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness over the arms and legs, and difficulty breathing. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year.
Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in the PREVENT study, our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO. Despite best supportive care, patients continue to experience disabling or life-threatening attacks. Each new relapse or attack brings a risk of a devastating outcome, including blindness, paralysis, respiratory failure or premature death. We are working diligently with investigators globally to complete enrollment in this study next year.
In kidney transplant, we continue to enroll patients in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in delayed graft function, or DGF. This is a debilitating condition in which a transplanted organ does not initially function properly, which can result in rejection or early graft loss. In addition, due to the poor outcomes associated with DGF, 15% to 20% of donor kidneys are discarded each year, reducing the already limited supply of donor organs. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year.
As the global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus on innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement-mediated diseases. In Q1, we strengthened and broadened our portfolio of complement inhibitors to now include 7 molecules across diverse platforms. Three of these molecules are already in Clinical Development.
ALXN 1210, a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing, and ALXN 5500, the first of our next-generation Soliris molecules. We are advancing Phase I study of these first molecules, and we'll progress at least one into a Phase II PNH trial this year, with additional indications likely to follow. We are targeting approval of at least one of these molecules in 2018.
We are also developing ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody to C5a, which is an attractive target given its specific role in a number of complement-mediated disorders. We are currently conducting Phase II studies with the ALXN 1007 in patients with too severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases: Antiphospholipid syndrome, or APS; and graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVHD. Severe GI-GVHD is an obstacle to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplants, with significant mortality within the first 100 days post-transplant. We continue to expect to have interim data in the GI-GVHD study later in 2015.
Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience in complement biology to progress an additional 4 preclinical programs, 2 of which we added through strategic investments in Q1.
In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP replacement therapy, a small molecule approach to the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. The synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on our expanding pipeline, driven by both internal and acquired preclinical programs. As such, we are advancing our portfolio of 17 programs, including those resulting from our collaboration with Moderna, where in the first year, we have initiated preclinical development in 7 mRNA rare disease programs and are targeting our first to enter the clinic in 2016.
In Q1, we continued to collaborate with Vanderbilt University to build on the preclinical data showing the potential of asfotase alfa as a treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role as it does in HPP. While the existing research in this area is at a very early stage, we look forward to further exploring this potential second use of asfotase alfa and are planning to enter the clinic in 2016.
As we look to build upon our robust pipeline, we completed a transaction with Blueprint Medicines to discover, develop and commercialize novel drug candidate for an activated kinase target that is the cause of a rare genetic disease. This is a very promising approach as they already have molecules with impressive selectivity toward the target kinase.
We are continuing to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates on all of our programs as the year proceeds.
I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

And the disease and diagnostic initiatives that we are running is really through educating physicians about patients who may be diagnosed with another disorder, another metabolic bone disorder or other symptoms that maybe also overlap with HPP, and really through that education. And the use of a simple alk phos test, which is available to physicians to better understand how to identify these patients. It's helping physicians to better appreciate which patients in their practice may have HPP. At the same time, as we've indicated, our 10 10 [ph] trial continues to be open and enroll children with HPP.

It's a great question. I'd say in the U.S., of course, the first country in which we launched Soliris for PNH back in April '07, is that today, we see ourselves starting to approach sort of that point where we think we're getting to identifying about half of the patients that may have the disease. And around the world, globally, slightly less than that, as we launched later in those other territories. I'd say, Geoff, one of the things that we're benefiting from, of course, is that we see that Soliris helps to change the natural history of disease. We're aided by the fact that there is an incidence rate, albeit not as high as aHUS, but there is an incidence rate for PNH. That means new patients are coming into the system every year. And the symptoms associated with PNH still continue to resemble symptoms of more common bone marrow failure syndromes or clotting disorders. And based upon that, physicians just miss these patients. And we want to get there fast, with a 35% death rate at 5 years. And so we think all of that combined puts us in a really good position. And we see, as we presented previously, a continued steady identification of new patients across our 50-country platform. In 2015, same steady contribution of new patients on a quarterly basis, as we did in the earlier stages of the launch. In terms of PNH versus aHUS, as I indicated, 14 quarters out now following the FDA approval, there are more patients actively on treatment with Soliris for aHUS. And we think the success of the diagnostic programs, combined with the higher incidents -- and of course these patients with aHUS are presenting urgently a high degree of medical severity, including renal impairment or renal failure, and that is actually helping us to diagnose patients faster. But we still think there's a number of patients we miss. We think there's great upside in the U.S. and around the world to reach more physicians with those disease and diagnostic initiatives to get to those patients sooner."

As we have indicated on past calls, we observed that the persistency for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS is good, but less than that of the historically observed, a very, very, very high rate in PNH. And I think though, the thing that I've characterized in the past is given that aHUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy and there are a few other thrombotic microangiopathies that are viewed as more of a short-term intermittent disease. One key part of our educational program, over time, has been that aHUS is a genetic lifelong disease, as opposed to say, for example, STEC-HUS. And so over time, we think physicians are gaining a better appreciation. As you know, we started out with our U.S. and European labels with only 6 months of efficacy data, that is now moved to 2 years and beyond. And we believe that this update, which also provides specific clinical evidence of patients that were discontinued and monitored closely over time, still had a very bad devastating outcome including specifically a patient progressing to ESRD. So we think both the longer-term efficacy data showing that more patients have a clinically meaningful improvement on Soliris treatment, combined with also the protection from the risk of severe devastating thrombotic microangiopathy, is going to continue to support our efforts with physicians around the world."

I guess this time, it wasn't a question for everybody, but why don't I take them. A way to think about aHUS as we've always said, obviously, the disease is devastating to both children and adults. But when you look at the mix of patients -- the way to think about our aHUS franchise is the average per patient dose across the population, think about it as it fits right into PNH, right, when you balance out the children and the adults. In terms of patients in or out of the hospital setting, we think about patients 2 ways. The patients with active progressing TMA. They're the ones I'm referring to that are presenting urgently, usually to a hospital, because their platelets are plummeting, their LVH is rising, they have symptoms of hemolysis and, of course, their kidneys are greatly impaired or failing. And so we see the majority of the patients that we identify and starting on treatment are at that level. But at the same time, there are patients that have perhaps absorbed a history of thrombotic microangiopathy. That might be out in the clinics with nephrologists and hematologists. And again, that's part of the leverage that we have with our field team that also focuses on PNH, where most of the PNH patients are actually identified in the hematology clinic. So that leverage actually allows us to both capture the opportunity to serve patients in the hospital as well as out in the clinics. And then I think your last question, and Martin can certainly add to this, the questions that we're getting from regulators, I think as Eric pointed out, would just be kind of straightforward questions that we would expect in the normal course of the process but with us standing by the transformative impact.

Q2 was a strong quarter for Alexion as we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones, while also completing the Synageva acquisition to strengthen our position as a global leader in serving patients with devastating and rare diseases.
In Q2, we fired on all cylinders. First, our commercial organization delivered steady growth in both PNH and aHUS, reflecting the strength of our core Soliris business.
Second, we substantially advanced our all next product, Strensiq, towards commercialization with our first approval in Japan and as well as a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Third, we continued to expand our complement franchise as we exceeded the target enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab in refractory myasthenia gravis.
Fourth, we delivered these milestones as we simultaneously announced and closed the Synageva acquisition and advanced Kanuma with a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Fifth, we progressed the broadest pipeline in our history of a driving toward as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma later this year.
And finally, we had another strong quarter financial performance. In Q2, product revenues were $636 million, an increase of 24% over Q2 2014, despite the continued weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses.
We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share. As result of strong performance in PNH and aHUS in the first half of 2015, and our expectations for continued strong Soliris volume growth, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion despite continued currency headwinds.
This guidance includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year. Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare disease, we expect to launch trajectory to be slow and steady. Vikas will provide updates on our full guidance which now includes the acquisition of Synageva.
Taking a closer look at PNH in Q2, as in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest, as well as in other key markets, such as Turkey and Brazil. The ongoing success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. 
Our experience affirms our view that, on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. In aHUS, in Q2, the strength of the global launch was again reflected by a consistently high number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time now 15 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S, there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval.
The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen.
Importantly, we see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global compliment franchise in both PNH and aHUS. I would now like to like to turn to our metabolic franchise.
During the quarter, we both announced and closed our acquisition of Synageva, while continuing to execute strong growth in our core Soliris business. We also simultaneously delivered important regulatory milestones towards our upcoming global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, which both will further diversify and accelerate our growth. These 2 highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies address the underlying cost of HPP and LAL-D.
First, in Japan, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq as a treatment for patients with HPP. The broad label includes patients of all ages and contains strong clinical data, including that the youngest HPP treated with Strensiq had an 84% overall survival. We are urgently working with the Japanese health care authorities to make this breakthrough therapy available to patients as quickly as possible.
Second, in Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Strensiq. The proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment.
Third, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for Kanuma. The proposed indication will include patients of all ages with LAL-D. These positive recommendations reflect the strong clinical value proposition for Strensiq and Kanuma to treat the devastating nature of HPP and LAL-D.
Final decisions from the European Commission are expected later this quarter, after which we will commence the reimbursement processes on a country-by-country basis. And finally in the U.S., we continued to progress the regulatory processes with the FDA for both products, which are each undergoing priority review and expect decisions later this year.
With these meaningful regulatory milestones, we are preparing for 2 product launches and plan to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D, with a single metabolic field team across our 50-country operating platform. We are applying our proven disease awareness and diagnostic expertise from PNH and aHUS to HPP and LAL-D, including developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways to identify patients at higher likelihood of having the diseases, which will lead to more rapid and accurate diagnosis. We expect to serve initial patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan later this year.
Turning now to our growing portfolio of highly innovative product candidates. We continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. Including Strensiq and Kanuma, we now have 8 product candidates in the clinic for 11 indications and expect at least 4 additional programs to enter the clinic in 2016.
In our late-stage pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we have exceeded our enrollment target in the eculizumab resignation trial and refractory MG and expect preliminary data in mid-2016. We're also working diligently to fully enroll 2 additional ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO and DGF.
In the quarter, we continued to progress our broad portfolio of 7 highly innovative compliment inhibitors, 3 of which are already in Clinical Development. Our lead next generation Soliris molecule, ALXN1210, is a longer acting antibody suitable for monthly dosing.
Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patents for ALXN1210 in effect until March 2035, extending our leadership and complement and strengthening our ability to serve patients for several more decades to come. Martin will discuss our lead development programs in more detail later in the call.
To support our growing product portfolio, we announced in Q2 our plans to expand our manufacturing operations with the construction of a biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland, along with our Rhode Island facility and other investments in our third party suppliers, we are broadening our capabilities, while expanding our capacity and increasing the redundancy of our global manufacturing network.
Looking at the second half of 2015 and beyond, we will continue to focus on what we know well and do well, developing and delivering transformative therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases. With an unprecedented range of opportunities, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day on December 10th in New York City.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"
347983,306628723,842646,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. In Q2, we achieved strong financial performance while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2, or 24% above the year-ago quarter.

Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2, or 24% above the year-ago quarter. This strong revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 7.6% or $39 million in currency headwinds in Q2 over the year-ago quarter.
The growth of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in our pipeline and in our commercial platform as we broaden our product portfolio. We achieved Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share.
As a reminder, our Q2 financial results reflect the inclusion of the Synageva financial results for the last week of the quarter. In Q2, we had a non-GAAP income tax benefit of $1.6 million. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva in 2015.
For the first half of 2015, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 3%. Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.5 billion in debt. In addition to paying off our debt obligation, we will continue to focus our capital allocation priorities on the following: investing in our product launches, advancing our robust pipeline, enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, evaluating additional opportunities that fit our strategic objectives and utilizing our share repurchase authorization over time.
Based on our expectation for continued strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance from the previous range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion now to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. This guidance also includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year.
Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare diseases, we expect the long trajectory to be slow and steady. We are increasing our revenue guidance despite currency headwinds.
Looking specifically at Q3, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $662 million to $665 million, including a continued negative currency impact of approximately $43 million to $46 million as compared to Q3 2014.
On a sequential basis, the Q3 revenue guidance includes a $4 million to $6 million negative currency impact over Q2. The Q3 results will include a full quarter of cost related to the Synageva operations, as we build towards our synergy and prepare for Kanuma launch. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95 in Q3.
I would also highlight the following other elements of our 2015 guidance. We continue to expect cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guided range of 8% to 9%. We are revising our R&D guidance to $520 million to $540 million, and we are revising our SG&A guidance to $690 million to $710 million. This new operating expense guidance is due to additional investment in our expanded pipeline from the acquisition and in the Kanuma launch.
In addition, for the second half of 2015, we expect to incur interest expense of $55 million. We also expect a fully diluted share count for the second half of 2015 to be approximately 232 million shares, resulting in a weighted average share count of approximately 219 million shares for the full year of 2015.
Importantly, we now expect our 2015 full year non-GAAP cash tax rate to be in the low range of 3% to 4% versus our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses and tax credits from Synageva in 2015.
Regarding our tax rate beyond 2015, we are in the process of executing our Synageva integration plan. Early on, we identified that an important value driver of the Synageva acquisition was the ability to incorporate Synageva business into our structure, resulting in a benefit to our tax rate. This will result in a reduction of 2% to our long-term non-GAAP tax rate in 2019 and beyond, from our previous guided range of 14% to 16%, now to the lower range of 12% to 14%. We expect our tax rate to gradually rise from 3% to 4% in 2015 to 12% to 14% in 2019, as we utilize our NOLs and tax credits.
In addition to our anticipated tax benefit from the Synageva acquisition, we continued to expect operating synergies across our global platform, starting with $30 million for the second half of this year, and increasing to at least $150 million in 2017. This will allow us to reach an operating margin of 48% to 49% and non-GAAP EPS accretion in 2018, just 3 years after the launch of Kanuma.
In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter with 24% year-on-year increase in revenues and 29% year-over-year increase in EPS, while continuing to invest in growth and diversification of our business.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In the second quarter of 2015, our R&D teams made significant progress in advancing our pipeline as we drive towards achieving up to 8 new product indication approvals through 2018. I will provide an update on our lead programs, starting with our late stage metabolic franchise.
Our regulatory filings for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe are on track. In the U.S., with breakthrough designation, our rolling BLE is undergoing priority review and our application continues to progress with the FDA and we expect a decision later this year.
In Europe, we received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in late June, recommending marketing authorization of Strensiq as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia, or HPP, to treat the bone manifestation of the disease.
Importantly, the proposed SNpc states that HPP is associated with multiple bone manifestations, including rickets,, altered phosphate metabolism, impaired growth and mobility, respiratory compromise that may require ventilation, and vitamin B6 response seizures. The natural history of untreated infant hypophosphatasia patients suggest high mortality if ventilation is required.
The SNpc also indicates that 71% of instant patients treated with Strensiq who required ventilation support remain alive and continue on treatment. The CHMP opinion also notes that treatment with Strensiq improve skeletal structure as demonstrated by actual appearance of joints and histological appearance of bone biopsy material and by apparent catch-up hygiene. We are pleased that the proposed indication will allow any patients who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Japan. The rapid approval and strong label for Strensiq underscores the devastating nature of HPP and the life transforming impact that Strensiq can provide to patients in Japan.
Moving to Kanuma. Our latest stage enzyme replacement therapy being investing for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, or LAL-D. This is a genetic, progressive, ultra-rare metabolic disease for patients, which includes infants, children and adults, experience chronic lipid accumulation causing multi-organ damage and premature death. Kanuma is a form of the human LAL enzymes designed to address the underlying cause of LAL-D.
The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Kanuma for LAL-D presenting in infants and excepted the BLA for priority review. Our application continues to progress with the FDA and we expect the decision for Kanuma later this quarter.
In Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion for Kanuma in late June, recommending marketing authorization for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients of all ages with LAL-D. As a reminder, LAL-D is fatal in infants, with a median survival of 3.7 months. In children and adults with LAL-D, about half will have fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or death within 3 years of diagnosis. 
I've noted in the CHMP opinion the benefits of Kanuma are its ability to replace the activity of the missing enzyme resulting in improvements in key liver and lipid endpoints, including importantly a reduction in liver fat content. In addition, there was a 67% survival benefit in infants with LAL-D beyond 12 months. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015, and we look forward to bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in Europe as quickly as possible.
In Japan, a new drug application for Kanuma was submitted in Q2, and we expect a decision from the MHLW in the first half of 2016. Turning to our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab. We have exceeded the target enrollment in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis or MG. The trial is designed to enroll patients who, despite receiving this supportive care, continued to experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, of the arms and legs and efficacy breathing. We expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016.
Also in neurology, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PREVENT study. Our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO in 2016. And in kidney transplant, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in the delayed graft function, or DGF, in 2015.
As a global leader in compliment biology, we continued to focus our innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement mediated diseases. Our portfolio of competent inhibitors include 7 molecules across diverse platforms, with 3 of these molecules already in Clinical Development. ALXN1210 is a long-acting NTC 5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing and is our lead next-generation Soliris molecule. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 that is in effect until March 2035.
As noted in the patent, ALXN1210 is administered intravenously and completely suppressed analysis in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer studies. The multiple ascending dose study of ALXN1210 is ongoing and we expect to initiate a Phase II PNH trial by the end of this year.
In addition, we are developing ALXN1017, our novel antibody targeting C-5a. We expect interim data from our Phase II study in patients with graft versus host disease and involving the gastrointestinal tract or GI-GVHD, severe and life-threatening autoimmune disease, later this year.
Turning to our metabolic portfolio, SBC one of the is an enzyme replacement therapy with sarcoidosis maybe, or MPS IIIB, which is a devastating and progressive rare metabolic disease. In Q2, enrollment is completed in the Phase I/II trial of SBC-103, and interim data are expected in the second half of 2015.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy. We are also pleased to have completed our planned enrollment in the REGAIN study in patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency, or MoCD type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease affecting newborns. We plan to initiate the pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of 2015.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on expanding our preclinical pipeline. We now have more than 30 diversed programs across a range of therapeutic modalities and we expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include, a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or S-1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role. SBC-105, an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial of infancy, or and other rare disorders of calcification. One of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with moderna and additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing competent inhibitor portfolio.
We are excited to be advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech as we drive towards as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma this year, and including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules by 2018.

So you know, I would just remind you last quarter, we specifically had 1 issue with the canceled manufacturing campaign which we alluded to. That was the 1 item that was highlighted obviously in the release and on the call. Other than that, continuing to operate with a financial discipline in which we've been operating with as a company for many, many years. As it relates to this quarter, I'll have Vikas to address it in a moment and then also provide you the longer-term outlook on expenses. As it relates to Strensiq, you're absolutely right. We felt like, coming into this year, rolling BLA, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review that there'd be perhaps even more benefits and expedited review as it related to the U.S. approval. We indicated last quarter, we now saw that timeline really moving to the second half story for approval. But we also saw in the quarter the positive opinion in Europe for CHMP and of course, the very rapid approval in Japan by PMDA. And there really is nothing other than the fact that I think are important outcome what you see in Europe and Japan and what's expected with Breakthrough Therapy designation now in the U.S., which is infantile and juvenile onset HPP, which is very important as the opportunity to serve patients with HPP that had symptoms of disease before the age of 18. That's what we saw in Europe, that's what we would -- that's with we're, obviously, focused on in our discussions with regulators in the U.S, as well as that's what the breakthrough designation is for. So we feel that label thus far are reflective of the devastating nature of HPP for all patients who have pediatric onset disease as well as the transformative benefits that Strensiq can provide to those patients, including the youngest patients who are exposed to an extremely high mortality rate at 1 and 3 years. And Martin and I, I think share the survival numbers review for those patients were exposed to Strensiq. So no real surprises there. Where aligning our U.S. team up to be rent ready to launch both Kanuma and Strensiq later this year. Vikas, expenses?"

If you look at what David mentioned earlier, we fired in all cylinders. And when you start looking at those multiple things that we did, we back up for the non-GAAP several expenses that are related to restructuring and the closing. But as I mentioned, if you look at Q2 even carefully, even without the tax impact, it's -- you will find that Synageva acquisition wasn't there, we would have really done still very well on the EPS side. We had a tail of last week of Q2 at around $5 million, $6 million of expenses from them. There was a lot of work that was done during Q2 on analyzing projects and acquisitions. So which I'll get into that, right? When we look forward from here, that's where I think you need to focus on is we're increasing our expense guidance by approximately $140 million. Now, on a standalone basis, that would have been approximately $170 million of spending in the second half. So we have taken off already $30 million as of today, right, for the second half? Now, when you look at the longer picture, so when we analyze $140 million for a full year, it's around $280 million. And for us to get -- achieve our targeted $150 million savings that we had promised for 2017, from 280 , we have to get down to 190 levels, right? And what that does, if you really focus on -- focus on the operating margins, we are currently around 43%. And if we can get through the synergy line, we will be back up to 48%, 49% by 2018."

So we would like to continue the same philosophy going forward because what happens in this is the we saw a very dramatic move this year. We were able to mitigate half of it this year. And so when you move from '15 to '16, the impact needs to reduce significantly. The view of taking a very high FX hedge early on. Well, you can get that perfect. Get to the following couple of years, the dramatic drop to shift 1 year to another. In the long run, what happens with FX is whatever is the rate is going to be the long-term we hit in some mitigating factor of how slowly you take that impact. And so we would have taken a substantial impact this year. So going into '16, the impact if the rate continues to stay where it is and if it continues to deteriorate further from here, the impact will be not as high as we saw in 2015. So best to take it at that time when the rates have dramatically dropped that to go back 2 years later and remind people that rates have dropped 2 years back. That's the best view I have."

That's where it starts. And then, that moves through, obviously, the process of approval, the submission of dossiers to funding authorities on a country-by-country basis, which reflect the labels, which affect the nature of the disease and then also the expected clinical benefits that patients can see. So we think, to be able to actually work with both of the programs at the very same time from regulators through funding authorities that, that really position us quite well to execute on what we know well and do well and what we've demonstrated with both CNH since 2007 and aHUS since 2011, which is when positioning the extreme rarity of disease, the devastating nature of the disease and the transformative benefits of the treatment, we have been able to produce very good success in enabling access for patients."

You're absolutely right, regarding EPS and the beat versus consensus. But that's -- so thank you for that. So I think, subsequently, related to the guidance and I just want to address it. When we established our revenue guidance back in January, remember, as I've already discussed with Josh, we were anticipating a first half of the year launch for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe. And obviously, we are awaiting for that to happen later on this year. So yes, the initial guidance did include a small initial contribution from Strensiq. But knowing the kinetics of an ultra-rare disease launch and the fact that it takes a period of time to really build up the patients on treatment, just that nudge back, obviously, means that contribution. Even for Strensiq and Kanuma combined, is now expected to be lower than it otherwise would have been if Strensiq had launched in the first half of the year. And what you see today is we more than make up for that with a very strong ongoing growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS. and of course, we are eagerly anticipating the all-out approvals and the U.S. and Europe to begin the reach patients later this year. But the kind they're coming in, you're serving initial patients for shorter period of time and we would expect largely the meaningful revenue contributions to really start in 2016. Vikas?"

We see this with eculizumab in our clinical studies. We are now seeing this with our lead follow-on program in 1210, the longer acting C-5 antibody. This is a level of hemolysis you need to seek to convert a benefit on PNH patients that we do with this. In terms of the second part of your question, it's enormously exciting for an R&D organization to be able to look at the assets that we have now and I mentioned on the call we have over 30 programs and preclinical the limit that were progressing. I favor doing that in a highly for our guys fashion. We're very observant in terms of cost. So we don't escalate and that really means choosing the very best programs that we can to prosecute. And I also said in the call to the fact that we intend that 4 of these programs will enter the clinic in 2016 is really as a testament to been able to progress the best programs. In terms of the platform, it's early days. Our scientists are very excited about looking at this platform, testing it both with both the programs that were ongoing, but also some of own programs to really see utility of this. I hope that helps, Ying."

Q2 was a strong quarter for Alexion, as we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones, while also completing the Synageva acquisition to strengthen our position as the global leader in serving patients with devast",1299,"Thank you, Elena. Q2 was a strong quarter for Alexion, as we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones, while also completing the Synageva acquisition to strengthen our position as the global leader in serving patients with devastating and rare diseases.
In Q2, we fired on all cylinders. First, our commercial organization delivered steady growth in both PNH and aHUS, reflecting the strength of our core Soliris business.
Second, we substantially advanced our next product, Strensiq, towards commercialization with our first approval in Japan and as well as a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Third, we continued to expand our complement franchise, as we exceeded the target enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab in refractory myasthenia gravis.
Fourth, we delivered these milestones as we simultaneously announced and closed the Synageva acquisition and advanced Kanuma with a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Fifth, we progressed the broadest pipeline in our history, driving toward as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma later this year.
And finally, we had another strong quarter of financial performance. In Q2, product revenues were $636 million, an increase of 24% over Q2 2014, despite the continued weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses.
We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share. As result of strong performance in PNH and aHUS in the first half of 2015 and our expectations for continued strong Soliris volume growth, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion despite continued currency headwinds.
This guidance includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year. Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare disease, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. Vikas will provide updates on our full guidance, which now includes the acquisition of Synageva.
Taking a closer look at PNH in Q2. As in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets, such as Turkey and Brazil. The ongoing success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, in Q2, the strength of the global launch was again reflected by a consistently high number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time now 15 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval.
The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen.
Importantly, we see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS.
I would now like to turn to our metabolic franchise.
During the quarter, we both announced and closed our acquisition of Synageva, while continuing to execute strong growth in our core Soliris business. We also simultaneously delivered important regulatory milestones toward our upcoming global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, which both will further diversify and accelerate our growth. These 2 highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies address the underlying cost of HPP and LAL-D.
First, in Japan, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq as a treatment for patients with HPP. The broad label includes patients of all ages and contains strong clinical data, including that the youngest HPP patients treated with Strensiq had an 84% overall survival. We are urgently working with the Japanese health care authorities to make this breakthrough therapy available to patients as quickly as possible.
Second, in Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization for Strensiq. The proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment.
Third, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for Kanuma. The proposed indication will include patients of all ages with LAL-D. These positive recommendations reflect the strong clinical value proposition for Strensiq and Kanuma to treat the devastating nature of HPP and LAL-D.
Final decisions from the European Commission are expected later this quarter, after which we will commence the reimbursement processes on a country-by-country basis.
And finally in the U.S., we continue to progress the regulatory processes with the FDA for both products, which are each undergoing priority review and expect decisions later this year.
With these meaningful regulatory milestones, we are preparing for 2 product launches and plan to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D with a single metabolic field team across our 50-country operating platform. We are applying our proven disease awareness and diagnostic expertise from PNH and aHUS to HPP and LAL-D, including developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways to identify patients at higher likelihood of having the diseases, which will lead to more rapid and accurate diagnosis. We expect to serve initial patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan later this year.
Turning now to our growing portfolio of highly innovative product candidates. We continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. Including Strensiq and Kanuma, we now have 8 product candidates in the clinic for 11 indications and expect at least 4 additional programs to enter the clinic in 2016.
In our late-stage pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we have exceeded our enrollment target in the eculizumab resignation trial in refractory MG and expect preliminary data in mid-2016. We are also working diligently to fully enroll 2 additional ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO and DGF.
In the quarter, we continued to progress our broad portfolio of 7 highly innovative complement inhibitors, 3 of which are already in clinical development. Our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing.
Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 in effect until March 2035, extending our leadership and complement and strengthening our ability to serve patients for several more decades to come. Martin will discuss our lead development programs in more detail later in the call.
To support our growing product portfolio, we announced in Q2 our plans to expand our manufacturing operations with the construction of a biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland. Along with our Rhode Island facility and other investments in our third-party suppliers, we are broadening our capabilities, while expanding our capacity and increasing the redundancy of our global manufacturing network.
Looking at the second half of 2015 and beyond, we will continue to focus on what we know well and do well, developing and delivering transformative therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases. With an unprecedented range of opportunities, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day on December 10 in New York City.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"
347983,306628723,842974,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. In Q2, we achieved strong financial performance while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2 or 24% above the year-ago quarter. This strong revenue growth was driven by a 31% incr",839,"Thanks, David. In Q2, we achieved strong financial performance while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2 or 24% above the year-ago quarter. This strong revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 7.6% or $39 million in currency headwinds in Q2 over the year-ago quarter.
The growth of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in our pipeline and in our commercial platform as we broaden our product portfolio. We achieved Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share.
As a reminder, our Q2 financial results reflect the inclusion of the Synageva financial results for the last week of the quarter. In Q2, we had a non-GAAP income tax benefit of $1.6 million. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva in 2015.
For the first half of 2015, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 3%.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.5 billion in debt. In addition to paying off our debt obligation, we will continue to focus our capital allocation priorities on the following: investing in our product launches, advancing our robust pipeline, enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, evaluating additional opportunities that fit our strategic objectives and utilizing our share repurchase authorization over time.
Based on our expectation for continued strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance from the previous range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion now to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. This guidance also includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year.
Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare diseases, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. We are increasing our revenue guidance despite currency headwinds.
Looking specifically at Q3, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $662 million to $665 million, including a continued negative currency impact of approximately $43 million to $46 million as compared to Q3 2014.
On a sequential basis, the Q3 revenue guidance includes a $4 million to $6 million negative currency impact over Q2. The Q3 results will include a full quarter of costs related to the Synageva operations, as we build towards our synergy goals and prepare for Kanuma launch. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95 in Q3.
I would also highlight the following other elements of our 2015 guidance. We continue to expect cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guided range of 8% to 9%. We are revising our R&D guidance to $520 million to $540 million, and we are revising our SG&A guidance to $690 million to $710 million. This new operating expense guidance is due to additional investment in our expanded pipeline from the acquisition and in the Kanuma launch.
In addition, for the second half of 2015, we expect to incur interest expense of $55 million. We also expect a fully diluted share count for the second half of 2015 to be approximately 232 million shares, resulting in a weighted average share count of approximately 219 million shares for the full year of 2015.
Importantly, we now expect our 2015 full year non-GAAP cash tax rate to be in the low range of 3% to 4% versus our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses and tax credits from Synageva in 2015.
Regarding our tax rate beyond 2015, we are in the process of executing our Synageva integration plan. Early on, we identified that an important value driver of the Synageva acquisition was the ability to incorporate Synageva business into our structure, resulting in a benefit to our tax rate. This will result in a reduction of 2% to our long-term non-GAAP tax rate in 2019 and beyond, from a previous guided range of 14% to 16% now to the lower range of 12% to 14%. We expect our tax rate to gradually rise from 3% to 4% in 2015 to 12% to 14% in 2019, as we utilize our NOLs and tax credits.
In addition to our anticipated tax benefit from the Synageva acquisition, we continue to expect operating synergies across our global platform, starting with $30 million for the second half of this year and increasing to at least $150 million in 2017. This will allow us to reach an operating margin of 48% to 49% and non-GAAP EPS accretion in 2018, just 3 years after the launch of Kanuma.
In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter with 24% year-on-year increase in revenues and 29% year-over-year increase in EPS, while continuing to invest in growth and diversification of our business.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In the second quarter of 2015, our R&D teams made significant progress in advancing our pipeline as we drive toward achieving up to 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018. I will provide an update on our lead programs, starting with our late-stage metabolic franchise.
Our regulatory filings for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe are on track. In the U.S., with breakthrough therapy designation, our rolling BLA is undergoing priority review and our application continues to progress with the FDA and we expect a decision later this year.
In Europe, we received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in late June, recommending marketing authorization of Strensiq as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia, or HPP, to treat the bone manifestations of the disease.
Importantly, the proposed SNpc states that HPP is associated with multiple bone manifestations, including rickets, osteomalacia, altered calcium phosphate metabolism, impaired growth and mobility, respiratory compromise that may require ventilation and vitamin B6 responsive seizures. The natural history of untreated infant hypophosphatasia patients suggests high mortality if ventilation is required.
The SNpc also indicates that 71% of infant patients treated with Strensiq who required ventilation support remain alive and continue on treatment. The CHMP opinion also notes that treatment with Strensiq improve skeletal structure as demonstrated by x-ray appearance of joints and histological appearance of bone biopsy material and by apparent catch-up height gain. We are pleased that the proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Japan. The rapid approval and strong label for Strensiq underscores the devastating nature of HPP and the life-transforming impact that Strensiq can provide to patients in Japan.
Moving to Kanuma. Our late-stage enzyme replacement therapy being investigated for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, or LAL-D. This is a genetic, progressive, ultra-rare metabolic disease for patients, which include infants, children and adults, experience chronic lipid accumulation causing multi-organ damage and premature death. Kanuma is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme designed to address the underlying cause of LAL-D.
The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Kanuma for LAL-D presenting in infants and accepted to BLA for priority review. Our application continues to progress with the FDA, and we expect the decision for Kanuma later this quarter.
In Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion for Kanuma in late June, recommending marketing authorization for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients of all ages with LAL-D. As a reminder, LAL-D is fatal in infants, with a median survival of 3.7 months. In children and adults with LAL-D, about half will have fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or death within 3 years of diagnosis. 
I've noted in the CHMP opinion the benefits of Kanuma are its ability to replace the activity of the missing enzyme, resulting in improvements in key liver and lipid endpoints, including importantly a reduction in liver fat content. In addition, there was a 67% survival benefit in infants with LAL-D beyond 12 months.
A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015, and we look forward to bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in Europe as quickly as possible.
In Japan, a new drug application for Kanuma was submitted in Q2, and we expect a decision from the MHLW in the first half of 2016.
Turning to our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab. We have exceeded the target enrollment in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. The trial was designed to enroll patients, who despite receiving best supportive care, continue to experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness of the arms and legs and difficulty breathing. We expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016.
Also in neurology, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PREVENT study. Our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, in 2016.
And in kidney transplant, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in the delayed graft function, or DGF, in 2015.
As a global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus our innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement-mediated diseases. Our portfolio of complement inhibitors include 7 molecules across diverse platforms, with 3 of these molecules already in clinical development. ALXN1210 is a long-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing and is our lead next-generation Soliris molecule. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 that is in effect until March 2035.
As noted in the patent, ALXN1210 is administered intravenously and completely suppress tumor lysis  in a Phase I healthy volunteer study. The multiple ascending dose study of ALXN1210 is ongoing, and we expect to initiate a Phase II PNH trial by the end of this year.
In addition, we are developing ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We expect interim data from our Phase II study in patients with graft-versus-host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune disease, later this year.
Turning to our metabolic portfolio. SBC-103 is an enzyme replacement therapy for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, which is a devastating and progressive rare metabolic disease. In Q2, enrollment was completed in the Phase I/II trial of SBC-103, and interim data are expected in the second half of 2015.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy. We are also pleased to have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease affecting newborns. We plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of 2015.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on expanding our preclinical pipeline. We now have more than 30 diverse programs across a range of therapeutic modalities, and we expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa, a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type-1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role; SBC-105, an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification; one of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna; and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio.
We are excited to be advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech as we drive towards as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma this year and including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules by 2018.

So I would just remind you, last quarter, we specifically had one issue with the canceled manufacturing campaign, which we alluded to. That was the one item that was highlighted, obviously, in the release and on the call. Other than that, continuing to operate with a financial discipline in which we've been operating with as a company for many, many years. As it relates to this quarter, I'll have Vikas address it in a moment and also provide you the longer-term outlook on expenses. As it relates to Strensiq, you're absolutely right. I mean, we felt like, coming into this year, rolling BLA, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, that there'd be perhaps even more benefits and expedited review as it related to the U.S. approval. We indicated last quarter, we now saw that time line really moving to a second half story for approval. But we also saw in the quarter the positive opinion in Europe from CHMP and, of course, the very rapid approval in Japan by PMDA. And we -- there really is nothing other than the fact that I think an important outcome is what you see in Europe and Japan and what's expected with breakthrough therapy designation now in the U.S., which is infantile and juvenile onset HPP, which is very important, is the opportunity to serve patients with HPP that had symptoms of disease before the age of 18. That's what we saw in Europe. That's what we would -- that's what we're obviously focused on in our discussions with regulators in the U.S. as well as that's what the breakthrough therapy designation is for. So we feel that the label thus far are reflective of both the devastating nature of HPP for all patients who have pediatric onset disease as well as the transformative benefits that Strensiq can provide to those patients, including the youngest patients who are exposed to an extremely high mortality rate at 1 and 3 years. And Martin and I, I think, share the survival numbers with you for those patients who are exposed to Strensiq. So no real surprises there. We're aligning our U.S. team up to be ready to launch both Kanuma and Strensiq later this year. Vikas, expenses?"

If you look at what David mentioned earlier, we fired on all cylinders. And when you start looking at those multiple things that we did, we back out for the non-GAAP several expenses that are related to restructuring and the closing. But as I mentioned, if you look at Q2 even carefully, even without the tax impact, it's -- you will find that if Synageva acquisition wasn't there, we would have really done still very well on the EPS side. We had until last week of Q2 at around $5 million, $6 million of expenses from them. There was a lot of work that was done during Q2 on analyzing projects and acquisitions, which all get into that, right? When we look forward from here, that's where I think you need to focus on is we're increasing our expense guidance by approximately $140 million. Now on a stand-alone basis, that would have been approximately $170 million of spending in the second half. So we have taken off already $30 million as of today, right, for the second half? Now when you look at the longer picture, so when we analyze $140 million for a full year, it's around $280 million. And for us to get -- achieve our targeted $150 million savings that I had -- we had promised for 2017, from $280 million, we have to get down to $190 million levels, right? And what that does is if you really focus on the operating margins, we are currently around 43%. And if we can get through the synergy line, we will be back up to 48%, 49% by 2018."

The rationale for our hedging strategy has been that we also spend a lot in those local currencies, right? So when you look at the net exposure down in the EPS level, we get it down to like 20%, 25% of the overall sales that really gets exposed to our EPS line. So we would like to continue the same philosophy going forward because what happens in this is we saw a very dramatic move this year. We were able to mitigate half of it this year. And so when you move from '15 to '16, the impact needs to reduce significantly. The view of taking a very high FX hedge early on, well, you can get that when you can predict the year. But when you go to the following couple of years, the dramatic drop just shifts from one year to another. In the long run, what happens with FX, whatever is the rate, is going to be the long-term rate. It's a mitigating factor of how slowly you'd take that impact. And so we would have taken a substantial impact this year. So going into '16, the impact -- if the rate continues to stay where it is and it continues to deteriorate further from here, the impact will be not as high as we saw in 2015. So best to take it at a time when the rates have dramatically dropped than to go back 2 years later and remind people that rates have dropped 2 years back. That's the view I have."

That's where it starts. And then that moves through, obviously, the process of approval, the submission of dossiers to funding authorities on a country-by-country basis, which reflect the labels, which reflect the nature of the disease and then also the expected clinical benefits that patients can see. So we think to be able to actually work with both of the programs at the very same time from regulators through funding authorities that, that really does position us quite well to execute on what we know well and do well and what we've demonstrated with both PNH since 2007 and aHUS since 2011, which is when positioning the extreme rarity of the disease, the devastating nature of the disease and the transformative benefits of the treatment, we have been able to produce very good success in enabling access for patients."

And I -- you're absolutely right regarding EPS and the beat versus consensus. So thank you for that. I think subsequently related to the guidance, and I just want to address it, when we established our revenue guidance back in January, remember, as I've already discussed with Geoff, we were anticipating a first half of the year launch for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe. And obviously, we're awaiting for that to happen later on this year. So yes, the initial guidance did include a small initial contribution from Strensiq. But knowing the kinetics of an ultra-rare disease launch and the fact that it takes a period of time to really build up the patients on treatment, just that nudge back, obviously, means that contribution. Even for Strensiq and Kanuma combined, it's now expected to be lower than it otherwise would have been if Strensiq had launched in the first half of the year. And what you see today is we more than make up for that with a very strong ongoing growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS. And of course, we are eagerly anticipating the all-out approvals in the U.S. and Europe to begin to reach patients later this year. But by the time they're coming in, you're serving initial patients for a shorter period of time, and we would expect largely the meaningful revenue contributions to really start in 2016. Vikas?"

So that drive down a couple of percentage drop on an overall basis of the company, right? So that's step 1. The step 2 is then you look at what other NOLs and tax credits that we inherit from the acquisition. Now that has limitations to absorb that in a particular year. We start absorbing that from 2015. That's why you see the rate go down from 7%, 8% that we were expecting this year to 3%, 4%. And then we will continue to utilize these NOLs and tax credits over '16, '17, and maybe a little bit will be left by '18.

          Thank you, Elena. Q2 was a strong quarter for Alexion, as we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones, while also completing the Synageva acquisition to strengthen our position as the global leader in serving patients with devastating and rare diseases.
In Q2, we fired on all cylinders. First, our commercial organization delivered steady growth in both PNH and aHUS, reflecting the strength of our core Soliris business.
Second, we substantially advanced our next product, Strensiq, towards commercialization with our first approval in Japan and as well as a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Third, we continued to expand our complement franchise, as we exceeded the target enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab in refractory myasthenia gravis.
Fourth, we delivered these milestones as we simultaneously announced and closed the Synageva acquisition and advanced Kanuma with a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Fifth, we progressed the broadest pipeline in our history, driving toward as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma later this year.
And finally, we had another strong quarter of financial performance. In Q2, product revenues were $636 million, an increase of 24% over Q2 2014, despite the continued weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses.
We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share. As result of strong performance in PNH and aHUS in the first half of 2015 and our expectations for continued strong Soliris volume growth, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion despite continued currency headwinds.
This guidance includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year. Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare disease, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. Vikas will provide updates on our full guidance, which now includes the acquisition of Synageva.
Taking a closer look at PNH in Q2. As in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets, such as Turkey and Brazil. The ongoing success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, in Q2, the strength of the global launch was again reflected by a consistently high number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time now 15 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval.
The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen.
Importantly, we see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS.
I would now like to turn to our metabolic franchise.
During the quarter, we both announced and closed our acquisition of Synageva, while continuing to execute strong growth in our core Soliris business. We also simultaneously delivered important regulatory milestones toward our upcoming global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, which both will further diversify and accelerate our growth. These 2 highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies address the underlying cause of HPP and LAL-D.
First, in Japan, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq as a treatment for patients with HPP. The broad label includes patients of all ages and contains strong clinical data, including that the youngest HPP patients treated with Strensiq had an 84% overall survival. We are urgently working with the Japanese health care authorities to make this breakthrough therapy available to patients as quickly as possible.
Second, in Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization for Strensiq. The proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment.
Third, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for Kanuma. The proposed indication will include patients of all ages with LAL-D. These positive recommendations reflect the strong clinical value proposition for Strensiq and Kanuma to treat the devastating nature of HPP and LAL-D.
Final decisions from the European Commission are expected later this quarter, after which we will commence the reimbursement processes on a country-by-country basis.
And finally in the U.S., we continue to progress the regulatory processes with the FDA for both products, which are each undergoing priority review and expect decisions later this year.
With these meaningful regulatory milestones, we are preparing for 2 product launches and plan to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D with a single metabolic field team across our 50-country operating platform. We are applying our proven disease awareness and diagnostic expertise from PNH and aHUS to HPP and LAL-D, including developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways to identify patients at higher likelihood of having the diseases, which will lead to more rapid and accurate diagnosis. We expect to serve initial patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan later this year.
Turning now to our growing portfolio of highly innovative product candidates. We continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. Including Strensiq and Kanuma, we now have 8 product candidates in the clinic for 11 indications and expect at least 4 additional programs to enter the clinic in 2016.
In our late-stage pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we have exceeded our enrollment target in the eculizumab resignation trial in refractory MG and expect preliminary data in mid-2016. We are also working diligently to fully enroll 2 additional ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO and DGF.
In the quarter, we continued to progress our broad portfolio of 7 highly innovative complement inhibitors, 3 of which are already in clinical development. Our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing.
Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 in effect until March 2035, extending our leadership and complement and strengthening our ability to serve patients for several more decades to come. Martin will discuss our lead development programs in more detail later in the call.
To support our growing product portfolio, we announced in Q2 our plans to expand our manufacturing operations with the construction of a biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland. Along with our Rhode Island facility and other investments in our third-party suppliers, we are broadening our capabilities, while expanding our capacity and increasing the redundancy of our global manufacturing network.
Looking at the second half of 2015 and beyond, we will continue to focus on what we know well and do well, developing and delivering transformative therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases. With an unprecedented range of opportunities, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day on December 10 in New York City.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"

          Thanks, David. In Q2, we achieved strong financial performance while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2 or 24% above the year-ago quarter. This strong revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 7.6% or $39 million in currency headwinds in Q2 over the year-ago quarter.
The growth of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in our pipeline and in our commercial platform as we broaden our product portfolio. We achieved Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share.
As a reminder, our Q2 financial results reflect the inclusion of the Synageva financial results for the last week of the quarter. In Q2, we had a non-GAAP income tax benefit of $1.6 million. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva in 2015.
For the first half of 2015, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 3%.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.5 billion in debt. In addition to paying off our debt obligation, we will continue to focus our capital allocation priorities on the following: investing in our product launches, advancing our robust pipeline, enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, evaluating additional opportunities that fit our strategic objectives and utilizing our share repurchase authorization over time.
Based on our expectation for continued strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance from the previous range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion now to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. This guidance also includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year.
Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare diseases, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. We are increasing our revenue guidance despite currency headwinds.
Looking specifically at Q3, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $662 million to $665 million, including a continued negative currency impact of approximately $43 million to $46 million as compared to Q3 2014.
On a sequential basis, the Q3 revenue guidance includes a $4 million to $6 million negative currency impact over Q2. The Q3 results will include a full quarter of costs related to the Synageva operations, as we build towards our synergy goals and prepare for Kanuma launch. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95 in Q3.
I would also highlight the following other elements of our 2015 guidance. We continue to expect cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guided range of 8% to 9%. We are revising our R&D guidance to $520 million to $540 million, and we are revising our SG&A guidance to $690 million to $710 million. This new operating expense guidance is due to additional investment in our expanded pipeline from the acquisition and in the Kanuma launch.
In addition, for the second half of 2015, we expect to incur interest expense of $55 million. We also expect a fully diluted share count for the second half of 2015 to be approximately 232 million shares, resulting in a weighted average share count of approximately 219 million shares for the full year of 2015.
Importantly, we now expect our 2015 full year non-GAAP cash tax rate to be in the low range of 3% to 4% versus our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses and tax credits from Synageva in 2015.
Regarding our tax rate beyond 2015, we are in the process of executing our Synageva integration plan. Early on, we identified that an important value driver of the Synageva acquisition was the ability to incorporate Synageva business into our structure, resulting in a benefit to our tax rate. This will result in a reduction of 2% to our long-term non-GAAP tax rate in 2019 and beyond, from a previous guided range of 14% to 16% now to the lower range of 12% to 14%. We expect our tax rate to gradually rise from 3% to 4% in 2015 to 12% to 14% in 2019, as we utilize our NOLs and tax credits.
In addition to our anticipated tax benefit from the Synageva acquisition, we continue to expect operating synergies across our global platform, starting with $30 million for the second half of this year and increasing to at least $150 million in 2017. This will allow us to reach an operating margin of 48% to 49% and non-GAAP EPS accretion in 2018, just 3 years after the launch of Kanuma.
In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter with 24% year-on-year increase in revenues and 29% year-over-year increase in EPS, while continuing to invest in growth and diversification of our business.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

          Thank you, Vikas. In the second quarter of 2015, our R&D teams made significant progress in advancing our pipeline as we drive toward achieving up to 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018. I will provide an update on our lead programs, starting with our late-stage metabolic franchise.
Our regulatory filings for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe are on track. In the U.S., with breakthrough therapy designation, our rolling BLA is undergoing priority review and our application continues to progress with the FDA and we expect a decision later this year.
In Europe, we received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in late June, recommending marketing authorization of Strensiq as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia, or HPP, to treat the bone manifestations of the disease.
Importantly, the proposed SNpc states that HPP is associated with multiple bone manifestations, including rickets, osteomalacia, altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, impaired growth and mobility, respiratory compromise that may require ventilation and vitamin B6 responsive seizures. The natural history of untreated infant hypophosphatasia patients suggests high mortality if ventilation is required.
The SNpc also indicates that 71% of infant patients treated with Strensiq who required ventilation support remain alive and continue on treatment. The CHMP opinion also notes that treatment with Strensiq improves skeletal structure as demonstrated by x-ray appearance of joints and histological appearance of bone biopsy material and by apparent catch-up height gain. We are pleased that the proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Japan. The rapid approval and strong label for Strensiq underscores the devastating nature of HPP and the life-transforming impact that Strensiq can provide to patients in Japan.
Moving to Kanuma. Our late-stage enzyme replacement therapy being investigated for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, or LAL-D. This is a genetic, progressive, ultra-rare metabolic disease for patients, which include infants, children and adults, experience chronic lipid accumulation causing multi-organ damage and premature death. Kanuma is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme designed to address the underlying cause of LAL-D.
The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Kanuma for LAL-D presenting in infants and accepted to BLA for priority review. Our application continues to progress with the FDA, and we expect the decision for Kanuma later this quarter.
In Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion for Kanuma in late June, recommending marketing authorization for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients of all ages with LAL-D. As a reminder, LAL-D is fatal in infants, with a median survival of 3.7 months. In children and adults with LAL-D, about half will have fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or death within 3 years of diagnosis. 
I've noted in the CHMP opinion the benefits of Kanuma are its ability to replace the activity of the missing enzyme, resulting in improvements in key liver and lipid endpoints, including importantly a reduction in liver fat content. In addition, there was a 67% survival benefit in infants with LAL-D beyond 12 months.
A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015, and we look forward to bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in Europe as quickly as possible.
In Japan, a new drug application for Kanuma was submitted in Q2, and we expect a decision from the MHLW in the first half of 2016.
Turning to our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab. We have exceeded the target enrollment in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. The trial was designed to enroll patients, who despite receiving best supportive care, continue to experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness of the arms and legs and difficulty breathing. We expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016.
Also in neurology, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PREVENT study. Our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, in 2016.
And in kidney transplant, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in the delayed graft function, or DGF, in 2015.
As a global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus our innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement-mediated diseases. Our portfolio of complement inhibitors include 7 molecules across diverse platforms, with 3 of these molecules already in clinical development. ALXN1210 is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing and is our lead next-generation Soliris molecule. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 that is in effect until March 2035.
As noted in the patent, ALXN1210 is administered intravenously and completely suppress tumor lysis  in a Phase I healthy volunteer study. The multiple ascending dose study of ALXN1210 is ongoing, and we expect to initiate a Phase II PNH trial by the end of this year.
In addition, we are developing ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We expect interim data from our Phase II study in patients with graft-versus-host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune disease, later this year.
Turning to our metabolic portfolio. SBC-103 is an enzyme replacement therapy for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, which is a devastating and progressive rare metabolic disease. In Q2, enrollment was completed in the Phase I/II trial of SBC-103, and interim data are expected in the second half of 2015.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy. We are also pleased to have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of 2015.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on expanding our preclinical pipeline. We now have more than 30 diverse programs across a range of therapeutic modalities, and we expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa, a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type-1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role; SBC-105, an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification; one of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna; and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio.
We are excited to be advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech as we drive towards as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma this year and including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules by 2018.

As always, we thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as we work to transform the lives of patients around the world.

          Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And again, I appreciate the compliments on the EPS side. So I would just remind you, last quarter, we specifically had one issue with the canceled manufacturing campaign, which we alluded to. That was the one item that was highlighted, obviously, in the release and on the call. Other than that, continuing to operate with the financial discipline in which we've been operating with as a company for many, many years. As it relates to this quarter, I'll have Vikas address it in a moment and also provide you the longer-term outlook on expenses. As it relates to Strensiq, you're absolutely right. I mean, we felt like, coming into this year, rolling BLA, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, that there'd be perhaps even more benefits and expedited review as it related to the U.S. approval. We indicated last quarter, we now saw that time line really moving to a second half story for approval. But we also saw in the quarter the positive opinion in Europe from CHMP and, of course, the very rapid approval in Japan by PMDA. And we -- there really is nothing other than the fact that I think an important outcome is what you see in Europe and Japan and what's expected with breakthrough therapy designation now in the U.S., which is infantile and juvenile onset HPP, which is very important, is the opportunity to serve patients with HPP that had symptoms of disease before the age of 18. That's what we saw in Europe. That's what we would -- that's what we're obviously focused on in our discussions with regulators in the U.S. as well as that's what the breakthrough therapy designation is for. So we feel that the labels thus far are reflective of both the devastating nature of HPP for all patients who have pediatric onset disease as well as the transformative benefits that Strensiq can provide to those patients, including the youngest patients who are exposed to an extremely high mortality rate at 1 and 3 years. And Martin and I, I think, share the survival numbers with you for those patients who are exposed to Strensiq. So no real surprises there. We're aligning our U.S. team up to be ready to launch both Kanuma and Strensiq later this year. Vikas, expenses?"

          Yes. So Geoff, if we look at Q2, there's enormous number of objectives that we executed upon, right? If you look at what David mentioned earlier, we fired on all cylinders. And when you start looking at those multiple things that we did, we back out for the non-GAAP several expenses that are related to restructuring and the closing. But as I mentioned, if you look at Q2 even carefully, even without the tax impact, it's -- you will find that if Synageva acquisition wasn't there, we would have really done still very well on the EPS side. We had until last week of Q2 at around $5 million, $6 million of expenses from them. There was a lot of work that was done during Q2 on analyzing projects and acquisitions, which all get into that, right? When we look forward from here, that's where I think you need to focus on is we're increasing our expense guidance by approximately $140 million. Now on a stand-alone basis, that would have been approximately $170 million of spending in the second half. So we have taken off already $30 million as of today, right, for the second half? Now when you look at the longer picture, so when we analyze $140 million for a full year, it's around $280 million. And for us to get -- achieve our targeted $150 million savings that I had -- we had promised for 2017, from $280 million, we have to get down to $190 million levels, right? And what that does is if you really focus on the operating margins, we are currently around 43%. And if we can get through the synergy line, we will be back up to 48%, 49% by 2018."

          So on the FX impact, we normally try to -- on the major currencies, we try to take 50%, half of it hedged. The rationale for our hedging strategy has been that we also spend a lot in those local currencies, right? So when you look at the net exposure down in the EPS level, we get it down to like 20%, 25% of the overall sales that really gets exposed to our EPS line. So we would like to continue the same philosophy going forward because what happens in this is we saw a very dramatic move this year. We were able to mitigate half of it this year. And so when you move from '15 to '16, the impact needs to reduce significantly. The view of taking a very high FX hedge early on, well, you can get that when you can predict the year. But when you go to the following couple of years, the dramatic drop just shifts from one year to another. In the long run, what happens with FX, whatever is the rate, is going to be the long-term rate. It's a mitigating factor of how slowly you'd take that impact. And so we would have taken a substantial impact this year. So going into '16, the impact -- if the rate continues to stay where it is and it continues to deteriorate further from here, the impact will be not as high as we saw in 2015. So best to take it at a time when the rates have dramatically dropped than to go back 2 years later and remind people that rates have dropped 2 years back. That's the view I have."

          And then regarding the question about concurrent reimbursement processes for both Strensiq and Kanuma really starts with where we are today, which is actively being involved with regulators as we finalize the labels that reflect both the devastating nature and severity of the disease for the patients who suffer from HPP and LAL-D as well as the broad range of transformative clinical benefits that patients can expect. That's where it starts. And then that moves through, obviously, the process of approval, the submission of dossiers to funding authorities on a country-by-country basis, which reflect the labels, which reflect the nature of the disease and then also the expected clinical benefits that patients can see. So we think to be able to actually work with both of the programs at the very same time from regulators through funding authorities that, that really does position us quite well to execute on what we know well and do well and what we've demonstrated with both PNH since 2007 and aHUS since 2011, which is when positioning the extreme rarity of the disease, the devastating nature of the disease and the transformative benefits of the treatment, we have been able to produce very good success in enabling access for patients."

We've seen several sort of favorable adjustments to the long-term tax guidance over time. And I just wanted to get a sense if you can talk a little bit further about the base forward at this time.

I think subsequently related to the guidance, and I just want to address it, when we established our revenue guidance back in January, remember, as I've already discussed with Geoff, we were anticipating a first half of the year launch for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe. And obviously, we're awaiting for that to happen later on this year. So yes, the initial guidance did include a small initial contribution from Strensiq. But knowing the kinetics of an ultra-rare disease launch and the fact that it takes a period of time to really build up the patients on treatment, just that nudge back, obviously, means that contribution. Even for Strensiq and Kanuma combined, it's now expected to be lower than it otherwise would have been if Strensiq had launched in the first half of the year. And what you see today is we more than make up for that with a very strong ongoing growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS. And of course, we are eagerly anticipating the all-out approvals in the U.S. and Europe to begin to reach patients later this year. But by the time they're coming in, you're serving initial patients for a shorter period of time, and we would expect largely the meaningful revenue contributions to really start in 2016. Vikas?"

We looked at the business combination very closely. And Synageva had already started -- the team had already started a lot of work on IT side, and we are trying to complete that as we go forward. So that drive down a couple of percentage drop on an overall basis of the company, right? So that's step 1. The step 2 is then you look at what other NOLs and tax credits that we inherit from the acquisition. Now that has limitations to absorb that in a particular year. We start absorbing that from 2015. That's why you see the rate go down from 7%, 8% that we were expecting this year to 3%, 4%. And then we will continue to utilize these NOLs and tax credits over '16, '17, and maybe a little bit will be left by '18.

I was wondering if you can give us a bit of a comparison of the data compared to your competitor's data on Alnylam C5 that was presented at EHA last month.

          Thank you very much. I'll take them in the order that you asked them, Ying. Rather than do a comparison, which we could go through quite a lot of day and take some time, suffice it to say that we know from years now of clinical data with eculizumab what type of hemolysis inhibition that you need to reach to have the profound effects in PNH patients. And we see -- and it's essentially 100% hemolysis that you need to see. We see this with eculizumab in our clinical studies. We are now seeing this with our lead follow-on program in 1210, the longer-acting C5 antibody. And it's our profound belief that this is a level of hemolysis you need to see to confer the benefits on PNH patients that we do witness. In terms of the second part of your question, it's enormously exciting for an R&D organization to be able to look at the assets that we have now. And I mentioned on the call, we have over 30 programs in preclinical development that we're progressing. I favor doing that in a highly prioritized fashion. We're very observant in terms of cost so that these don't escalate. And that really means choosing the very best programs that we can to prosecute. And as I also said in the call, the fact that we intend that 4 of these programs will enter the clinic in 2016 is really a testament to being able to progress the best programs. In terms of the platform, it's early days. Our scientists are very excited about looking at this platform, testing it both with the programs that were ongoing but also in some of our own programs to really see the utility of this. I hope that helps, Ying."

Q2 was a strong quarter for Alexion, as we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones, while also completing the Synageva acquisition to strengthen our position as the global leader in serving patients with devastating and rare diseases.
In Q2, we fired on all cylinders. First, our commercial organization delivered steady growth in both PNH and aHUS, reflecting the strength of our core Soliris business.
Second, we substantially advanced our next product, Strensiq, towards commercialization with our first approval in Japan and as well as a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Third, we continued to expand our complement franchise, as we exceeded the target enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab in refractory myasthenia gravis.
Fourth, we delivered these milestones as we simultaneously announced and closed the Synageva acquisition and advanced Kanuma with a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
Fifth, we progressed the broadest pipeline in our history, driving toward as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma later this year.
And finally, we had another strong quarter of financial performance. In Q2, product revenues were $636 million, an increase of 24% over Q2 2014, despite the continued weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses.
We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share. As result of strong performance in PNH and aHUS in the first half of 2015 and our expectations for continued strong Soliris volume growth, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion despite continued currency headwinds.
This guidance includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year. Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare disease, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. Vikas will provide updates on our full guidance, which now includes the acquisition of Synageva.
Taking a closer look at PNH in Q2. As in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets, such as Turkey and Brazil. The ongoing success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed.
Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.
In aHUS, in Q2, the strength of the global launch was again reflected by a consistently high number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time now 15 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 3 years post-approval.
The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen.
Importantly, we see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS.
I would now like to turn to our metabolic franchise.
During the quarter, we both announced and closed our acquisition of Synageva, while continuing to execute strong growth in our core Soliris business. We also simultaneously delivered important regulatory milestones toward our upcoming global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, which both will further diversify and accelerate our growth. These 2 highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies address the underlying cause of HPP and LAL-D.
First, in Japan, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq as a treatment for patients with HPP. The broad label includes patients of all ages and contains strong clinical data, including that the youngest HPP patients treated with Strensiq had an 84% overall survival. We are urgently working with the Japanese health care authorities to make this breakthrough therapy available to patients as quickly as possible.
Second, in Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization for Strensiq. The proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment.
Third, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for Kanuma. The proposed indication will include patients of all ages with LAL-D. These positive recommendations reflect the strong clinical value proposition for Strensiq and Kanuma to treat the devastating nature of HPP and LAL-D.
Final decisions from the European Commission are expected later this quarter, after which we will commence the reimbursement processes on a country-by-country basis.
And finally in the U.S., we continue to progress the regulatory processes with the FDA for both products, which are each undergoing priority review and expect decisions later this year.
With these meaningful regulatory milestones, we are preparing for 2 product launches and plan to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D with a single metabolic field team across our 50-country operating platform. We are applying our proven disease awareness and diagnostic expertise from PNH and aHUS to HPP and LAL-D, including developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways to identify patients at higher likelihood of having the diseases, which will lead to more rapid and accurate diagnosis. We expect to serve initial patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan later this year.
Turning now to our growing portfolio of highly innovative product candidates. We continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. Including Strensiq and Kanuma, we now have 8 product candidates in the clinic for 11 indications and expect at least 4 additional programs to enter the clinic in 2016.
In our late-stage pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we have exceeded our enrollment target in the eculizumab resignation trial in refractory MG and expect preliminary data in mid-2016. We are also working diligently to fully enroll 2 additional ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO and DGF.
In the quarter, we continued to progress our broad portfolio of 7 highly innovative complement inhibitors, 3 of which are already in clinical development. Our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, ALXN1210, is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing.
Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 in effect until March 2035, extending our leadership and complement and strengthening our ability to serve patients for several more decades to come. Martin will discuss our lead development programs in more detail later in the call.
To support our growing product portfolio, we announced in Q2 our plans to expand our manufacturing operations with the construction of a biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland. Along with our Rhode Island facility and other investments in our third-party suppliers, we are broadening our capabilities, while expanding our capacity and increasing the redundancy of our global manufacturing network.
Looking at the second half of 2015 and beyond, we will continue to focus on what we know well and do well, developing and delivering transformative therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases. With an unprecedented range of opportunities, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day on December 10 in New York City.
At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?"
347983,306628723,843727,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. In Q2, we achieved strong financial performance while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2 or 24% above the year-ago quarter.

Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2 or 24% above the year-ago quarter. This strong revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 7.6% or $39 million in currency headwinds in Q2 over the year-ago quarter.
The growth of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in our pipeline and in our commercial platform as we broaden our product portfolio. We achieved Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share.
As a reminder, our Q2 financial results reflect the inclusion of the Synageva financial results for the last week of the quarter. In Q2, we had a non-GAAP income tax benefit of $1.6 million. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva in 2015.
For the first half of 2015, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 3%.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.5 billion in debt. In addition to paying off our debt obligation, we will continue to focus our capital allocation priorities on the following: investing in our product launches, advancing our robust pipeline, enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, evaluating additional opportunities that fit our strategic objectives and utilizing our share repurchase authorization over time.
Based on our expectation for continued strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance from the previous range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion now to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. This guidance also includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year.
Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare diseases, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. We are increasing our revenue guidance despite currency headwinds.
Looking specifically at Q3, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $662 million to $665 million, including a continued negative currency impact of approximately $43 million to $46 million as compared to Q3 2014.
On a sequential basis, the Q3 revenue guidance includes a $4 million to $6 million negative currency impact over Q2. The Q3 results will include a full quarter of costs related to the Synageva operations, as we build towards our synergy goals and prepare for Kanuma launch. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95 in Q3.
I would also highlight the following other elements of our 2015 guidance. We continue to expect cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guided range of 8% to 9%. We are revising our R&D guidance to $520 million to $540 million, and we are revising our SG&A guidance to $690 million to $710 million. This new operating expense guidance is due to additional investment in our expanded pipeline from the acquisition and in the Kanuma launch.
In addition, for the second half of 2015, we expect to incur interest expense of $55 million. We also expect a fully diluted share count for the second half of 2015 to be approximately 232 million shares, resulting in a weighted average share count of approximately 219 million shares for the full year of 2015.
Importantly, we now expect our 2015 full year non-GAAP cash tax rate to be in the low range of 3% to 4% versus our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses and tax credits from Synageva in 2015.
Regarding our tax rate beyond 2015, we are in the process of executing our Synageva integration plan. Early on, we identified that an important value driver of the Synageva acquisition was the ability to incorporate Synageva business into our structure, resulting in a benefit to our tax rate. This will result in a reduction of 2% to our long-term non-GAAP tax rate in 2019 and beyond, from a previous guided range of 14% to 16% now to the lower range of 12% to 14%. We expect our tax rate to gradually rise from 3% to 4% in 2015 to 12% to 14% in 2019, as we utilize our NOLs and tax credits.
In addition to our anticipated tax benefit from the Synageva acquisition, we continue to expect operating synergies across our global platform, starting with $30 million for the second half of this year and increasing to at least $150 million in 2017. This will allow us to reach an operating margin of 48% to 49% and non-GAAP EPS accretion in 2018, just 3 years after the launch of Kanuma.
In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter with 24% year-on-year increase in revenues and 29% year-over-year increase in EPS, while continuing to invest in growth and diversification of our business.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?"

In the second quarter of 2015, our R&D teams made significant progress in advancing our pipeline as we drive toward achieving up to 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018. I will provide an update on our lead programs, starting with our late-stage metabolic franchise.
Our regulatory filings for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe are on track. In the U.S., with breakthrough therapy designation, our rolling BLA is undergoing priority review and our application continues to progress with the FDA and we expect a decision later this year.
In Europe, we received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in late June, recommending marketing authorization of Strensiq as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia, or HPP, to treat the bone manifestations of the disease.
Importantly, the proposed SNpc states that HPP is associated with multiple bone manifestations, including rickets, osteomalacia, altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, impaired growth and mobility, respiratory compromise that may require ventilation and vitamin B6 responsive seizures. The natural history of untreated infant hypophosphatasia patients suggests high mortality if ventilation is required.
The SNpc also indicates that 71% of infant patients treated with Strensiq who required ventilation support remain alive and continue on treatment. The CHMP opinion also notes that treatment with Strensiq improves skeletal structure as demonstrated by x-ray appearance of joints and histological appearance of bone biopsy material and by apparent catch-up height gain. We are pleased that the proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Japan. The rapid approval and strong label for Strensiq underscores the devastating nature of HPP and the life-transforming impact that Strensiq can provide to patients in Japan.
Moving to Kanuma. Our late-stage enzyme replacement therapy being investigated for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, or LAL-D. This is a genetic, progressive, ultra-rare metabolic disease for patients, which include infants, children and adults, experience chronic lipid accumulation causing multi-organ damage and premature death. Kanuma is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme designed to address the underlying cause of LAL-D.
The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Kanuma for LAL-D presenting in infants and accepted to BLA for priority review. Our application continues to progress with the FDA, and we expect the decision for Kanuma later this quarter.
In Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion for Kanuma in late June, recommending marketing authorization for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients of all ages with LAL-D. As a reminder, LAL-D is fatal in infants, with a median survival of 3.7 months. In children and adults with LAL-D, about half will have fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or death within 3 years of diagnosis. 
I've noted in the CHMP opinion the benefits of Kanuma are its ability to replace the activity of the missing enzyme, resulting in improvements in key liver and lipid endpoints, including importantly a reduction in liver fat content. In addition, there was a 67% survival benefit in infants with LAL-D beyond 12 months.
A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015, and we look forward to bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in Europe as quickly as possible.
In Japan, a new drug application for Kanuma was submitted in Q2, and we expect a decision from the MHLW in the first half of 2016.
Turning to our 3 ongoing registration trials with eculizumab. We have exceeded the target enrollment in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. The trial was designed to enroll patients, who despite receiving best supportive care, continue to experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of the head, spinal cord and respiratory system, causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness of the arms and legs and difficulty breathing. We expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016.
Also in neurology, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PREVENT study. Our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, in 2016.
And in kidney transplant, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in the delayed graft function, or DGF, in 2015.
As a global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus our innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement-mediated diseases. Our portfolio of complement inhibitors include 7 molecules across diverse platforms, with 3 of these molecules already in clinical development. ALXN1210 is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing and is our lead next-generation Soliris molecule. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 that is in effect until March 2035.
As noted in the patent, ALXN1210 is administered intravenously and completely suppress tumor lysis  in a Phase I healthy volunteer study. The multiple ascending dose study of ALXN1210 is ongoing, and we expect to initiate a Phase II PNH trial by the end of this year.
In addition, we are developing ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We expect interim data from our Phase II study in patients with graft-versus-host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune disease, later this year.
Turning to our metabolic portfolio. SBC-103 is an enzyme replacement therapy for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, which is a devastating and progressive rare metabolic disease. In Q2, enrollment was completed in the Phase I/II trial of SBC-103, and interim data are expected in the second half of 2015.
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy. We are also pleased to have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of 2015.
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on expanding our preclinical pipeline. We now have more than 30 diverse programs across a range of therapeutic modalities, and we expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa, a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type-1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role; SBC-105, an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification; one of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna; and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio.
We are excited to be advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech as we drive towards as many as 8 new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma this year and including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules by 2018.

So I would just remind you, last quarter, we specifically had one issue with the canceled manufacturing campaign, which we alluded to. That was the one item that was highlighted, obviously, in the release and on the call. Other than that, continuing to operate with the financial discipline in which we've been operating with as a company for many, many years. As it relates to this quarter, I'll have Vikas address it in a moment and also provide you the longer-term outlook on expenses. As it relates to Strensiq, you're absolutely right. I mean, we felt like, coming into this year, rolling BLA, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, that there'd be perhaps even more benefits and expedited review as it related to the U.S. approval. We indicated last quarter, we now saw that time line really moving to a second half story for approval. But we also saw in the quarter the positive opinion in Europe from CHMP and, of course, the very rapid approval in Japan by PMDA. And we -- there really is nothing other than the fact that I think an important outcome is what you see in Europe and Japan and what's expected with breakthrough therapy designation now in the U.S., which is infantile and juvenile onset HPP, which is very important, is the opportunity to serve patients with HPP that had symptoms of disease before the age of 18. That's what we saw in Europe. That's what we would -- that's what we're obviously focused on in our discussions with regulators in the U.S. as well as that's what the breakthrough therapy designation is for. So we feel that the labels thus far are reflective of both the devastating nature of HPP for all patients who have pediatric onset disease as well as the transformative benefits that Strensiq can provide to those patients, including the youngest patients who are exposed to an extremely high mortality rate at 1 and 3 years. And Martin and I, I think, share the survival numbers with you for those patients who are exposed to Strensiq. So no real surprises there. We're aligning our U.S. team up to be ready to launch both Kanuma and Strensiq later this year. Vikas, expenses?"

If you look at what David mentioned earlier, we fired on all cylinders. And when you start looking at those multiple things that we did, we back out for the non-GAAP several expenses that are related to restructuring and the closing. But as I mentioned, if you look at Q2 even carefully, even without the tax impact, it's -- you will find that if Synageva acquisition wasn't there, we would have really done still very well on the EPS side. We had until last week of Q2 at around $5 million, $6 million of expenses from them. There was a lot of work that was done during Q2 on analyzing projects and acquisitions, which all get into that, right? When we look forward from here, that's where I think you need to focus on is we're increasing our expense guidance by approximately $140 million. Now on a stand-alone basis, that would have been approximately $170 million of spending in the second half. So we have taken off already $30 million as of today, right, for the second half? Now when you look at the longer picture, so when we analyze $140 million for a full year, it's around $280 million. And for us to get -- achieve our targeted $150 million savings that I had -- we had promised for 2017, from $280 million, we have to get down to $190 million levels, right? And what that does is if you really focus on the operating margins, we are currently around 43%. And if we can get through the synergy line, we will be back up to 48%, 49% by 2018."

The rationale for our hedging strategy has been that we also spend a lot in those local currencies, right? So when you look at the net exposure down in the EPS level, we get it down to like 20%, 25% of the overall sales that really gets exposed to our EPS line. So we would like to continue the same philosophy going forward because what happens in this is we saw a very dramatic move this year. We were able to mitigate half of it this year. And so when you move from '15 to '16, the impact needs to reduce significantly. The view of taking a very high FX hedge early on, well, you can get that when you can predict the year. But when you go to the following couple of years, the dramatic drop just shifts from one year to another. In the long run, what happens with FX, whatever is the rate, is going to be the long-term rate. It's a mitigating factor of how slowly you'd take that impact. And so we would have taken a substantial impact this year. So going into '16, the impact -- if the rate continues to stay where it is and it continues to deteriorate further from here, the impact will be not as high as we saw in 2015. So best to take it at a time when the rates have dramatically dropped than to go back 2 years later and remind people that rates have dropped 2 years back. That's the view I have."

That's where it starts. And then that moves through, obviously, the process of approval, the submission of dossiers to funding authorities on a country-by-country basis, which reflect the labels, which reflect the nature of the disease and then also the expected clinical benefits that patients can see. So we think to be able to actually work with both of the programs at the very same time from regulators through funding authorities that, that really does position us quite well to execute on what we know well and do well and what we've demonstrated with both PNH since 2007 and aHUS since 2011, which is when positioning the extreme rarity of the disease, the devastating nature of the disease and the transformative benefits of the treatment, we have been able to produce very good success in enabling access for patients."

And I -- you're absolutely right regarding EPS and the beat versus consensus. So thank you for that. I think subsequently related to the guidance, and I just want to address it, when we established our revenue guidance back in January, remember, as I've already discussed with Geoff, we were anticipating a first half of the year launch for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe. And obviously, we're awaiting for that to happen later on this year. So yes, the initial guidance did include a small initial contribution from Strensiq. But knowing the kinetics of an ultra-rare disease launch and the fact that it takes a period of time to really build up the patients on treatment, just that nudge back, obviously, means that contribution. Even for Strensiq and Kanuma combined, it's now expected to be lower than it otherwise would have been if Strensiq had launched in the first half of the year. And what you see today is we more than make up for that with a very strong ongoing growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS. And of course, we are eagerly anticipating the all-out approvals in the U.S. and Europe to begin to reach patients later this year. But by the time they're coming in, you're serving initial patients for a shorter period of time, and we would expect largely the meaningful revenue contributions to really start in 2016. Vikas?"

So that drive down a couple of percentage drop on an overall basis of the company, right? So that's step 1. The step 2 is then you look at what other NOLs and tax credits that we inherit from the acquisition. Now that has limitations to absorb that in a particular year. We start absorbing that from 2015. That's why you see the rate go down from 7%, 8% that we were expecting this year to 3%, 4%. And then we will continue to utilize these NOLs and tax credits over '16, '17, and maybe a little bit will be left by '18.

Q3 was a landmark quarter for Alexion as we firmly establish our leadership in serving patients with rare and devastating diseases. During the quarter, we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones. First, our commercial team continued to serve an increasing number of patients, with PNH and UHS with Soliris; second, we received important regulatory approvals for Strensiq and Kanuma of establishing a platform to globally launch 2 new highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies; third, our R&D team continues to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline and biotech, with multiple key milestones expected in Q4 and beyond; and fourth, we had another quarter of strong financial performance. 
Looking first at our complement franchise in PNH, in Q3, as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients across our 50-country platform. In HUS, in Q3, we once again reached a consistent number of new patients. The ongoing strength of our global rollout confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with HUS, is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. We continue to see the majority of our opportunity to save new patients with PNH and HUS ahead of us. 
In our metabolic franchise, as we just announced, the FDA-approved Strensiq under breakthrough therapy review for patients with perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset HPP, a life-threatening ultrarare disease in which bone formation is incomplete, causing deformity of the skeleton, profound muscle weakness, seizures, severe pain and premature death. We are very pleased that the broad label for Strensiq will allow any patient who have symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. The label reflects the breakthrough medical innovation that Strensiq provides to patients and families. 
First, Strensiq-treated patients had overall survival of 97% compared to 42% for historical controlled patients of 48 weeks; second, 100% of juvenile onset HPP patients responded to Strensiq treatment as measured by substantial bone healing compared to only 6% of bone healing in the controlled group; third, 100% of treated patients had improvement in the weight or short statures or maintained normal height and weight; fourth, improvements in mobility were demonstrated in patients with juvenile-onset HPP. By 4 years of treatment, 100% of assessed patients achieved the 6-minute walk test within the normal range for matched peers were has no patience within the normal range at baseline prior to Strensiq treatment; and fifth, the label specifically includes extensive safety and efficacy data from 4 clinical studies with Strensiq treatment and patients for up to 6.5 years.
We are pleased that the broad and robust label reflects the transformative benefits of Strensiq for a very small number of patients who suffer from this chronic genetic metabolic disease. In Q3, we received regulatory approvals for Strensiq in the European Union, Japan and Canada. And like the U.S., the strong labels reflect the transformative benefits of Strensiq. As with PNH since 2007, our objective is that every patient with pediatric onset HPP who can benefit from Strensiq will have access to Strensiq. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We received the European approval for patients of all ages with LAL-D. The broad label compares patients with the most rapid disease progression. 67% of infants treated with Kanuma survived beyond 12 months of age whereas no infants in the historical control group survived past 8 months. In addition, the European label also includes clinical data in children and adults, demonstrating significant improvements in multiple disease manifestations, including markers of liver injury and liver fat content. In the U.S., Kanuma continues to be reviewed under the breakthrough therapy designation and priority review with a PDUFA date of December 8. We submitted additional chemistry manufacturing and controls or CMC data last month in response to the FDA's request. As a reminder, the FDA did not request additional clinical data. We continue to have constructive discussions with the agency as we work toward bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in the U.S. as quickly as possible. Our commitment to patients and families with HPP and LAL-D reflects that we know well and do well, delivering breakthrough medical innovations to transform the lives of patients suffering from devastating in ultrarare diseases. Carsten will provide in our updated our lunch plans for Strensiq and Kanuma later in the call. As we transitioned in Q3 to a multiproduct company, we are advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline and biotech. We distinguish ourselves with an exclusive focus on developing like transforming therapies. We are excited about our early and late stage portfolio of highly innovative product candidates and expect up to 6 new products or indication approvals through 2018. In fact, we have multiple catalysts in our pipeline this quarter, including Phase I/II data for SBC-103, our innovative enzyme replacement therapy for patients with MPS IIIB. Data from our Phase II study of ALXN 1007 in patients with GI-GVHD; initiation of her proof-of-concept PNH trial with ALXN 1210, our lead next generation Soliris molecule; and completion of enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab and delayed graft function in kidney transplant. 
As we head into 2016, R&D milestones include data from the registration trial of eculizumab and refractory M & G, data from ALXN 1210 in patients with PNH; completion of enrollment in the registration trial in refractory NMO; and progressing 4 preclinical programs into the clinic, including a messenger RNA therapy from our partnership and another additional complementary inhibitor.
Turning to our financial performance. Product revenues in Q3 were $666 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2014 despite increased weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in Soliris volume compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and HUS businesses, both in the third quarter and the year-to-date. Also, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Turning briefly to our 2015 guidance. This morning, we guided 2015 revenues to be in the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. Due to macroeconomic factors, in Latin American countries, we expected an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. 
Also this morning, we increased our EPS guidance for the year from $4.70 to $4.80 to a higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97, as a result of our strong Soliris growth, continued financial discipline and accelerated synergies from our recent synergy of acquisitions. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"
347983,313701897,885298,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. We were pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by the combination of strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline.

We were pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by the combination of strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $667 million in Q3 or 20% above the year-ago quarter, and net product sales were $666 million in this quarter. 
This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by a 9% or $49 million in currency headwinds in Q3 over the year-ago quarter. Q3 revenues were driven by continued strong growth of Soliris, and we also booked our initial sale for Strensiq in the final weeks of the third quarter. We look forward to serving patients with HPP around the world. However, I would like to remind you that given the low incidence and high mortality of HPP, as well as the country by country rollout, we expect the launch trajectory of Strensiq to be slow and steady as we build a robust global metabolic franchise over time. 
During the quarter, we continue to invest in the global buildout of our metabolic franchise and in our broad pipeline, including operating costs from the synergy of acquisition. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $147 million or 22% of revenue, and third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $182 million or 27% of revenue. During Q3, we recognized greater synergies from the acquisition compared to our expectations, which benefited both R&D and SG&A spend in the quarter. We also benefited from $5.6 million from lower expenses due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 0.5%. As we announced one our Q2 call, our 2015 tax rate will benefit from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva. We incurred a onetime GAAP tax expense of approximately $316 million. This GAAP tax expense is attributable to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the restructuring of Synageva's intellectual property into our existing structure. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Looking at the balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $3.5 billion in debt. Since we authorized our share repurchase program, we have to-date purchased, purchased $215 million or 1.3 million shares. We currently have $785 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we will continue to buy back additional shares opportunistically. 
Turning to our 2015 guidance. We continue to forecast strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and HUS of 28% for the full year and a very small contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma. We now expect 2015 revenues to be at the lower-end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. As a reminder, our 2015 revenue guidance includes an approximately negative 6% or $160 million foreign exchange impact compared to 2014 exchange rates. In addition, due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the year from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 to the higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97 as we accelerate synergies from our Synageva acquisition. 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenues of $697 million to $702 million. On a sequential basis, the Q4 revenue guidance includes a $5 million to $7 million negative currency impact. Operating expenses will be sequentially higher in Q4 due to the investment in the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12. In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter. We have continued to realize accelerated acquisition-related synergies earlier than expected, and we are on track to realize total annual synergies of at least $150 million in 2017. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Karsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?"

Our global commercial operations delivered a strong 29% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business. 
Starting with PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiative drove steady growth. We are consistently identifying a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan territories we have been operating the longest as well as other key markets such as Turkey, Brazil and Russia. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatments. In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 16 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there has been for PNH. We now see the same trends in Europe 4 years post-approval. Given that the incident of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that overtime, this trend of new patient additions will continue, and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. To support the aHUS community, we continue to enhance our disease awareness programs, further underscored by new data that will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting next week. Researchers will present findings from a long-term follow-up study that demonstrated better TME advantage rates was 3.5x higher in patients who discontinued Soliris versus those who stayed on treatment. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of ongoing Soliris treatment in preventing life-threatening complement-mediated TMA in patients with aHUS, further highlighting the importance of long-term treatment for these genetic and chronic ultrarare disease. 
Now I would like to turn to our global metabolic launches. Starting with Kanuma, we are very pleased that the new Journal of Medicine published our pivotal Phase III study in children and adults with LAL-D. Key findings show that all patients treated with Kanuma had a reduction in liver or ALT levels, which is a key marker of disease activity and liver injury. Children and adults treated with Kanuma had significant improvements in disease-related liver abnormalities compared with placebo. And in addition, the accompanying editorial stated that LAL-D is a rapidly fatal condition, and that enzyme replacement therapy could be lifesaving and transformational for all patients with LAL-D. The new England journal publication and editorial will support our disease education initiative with the LAL-D medical community. As a reminder, most patients in the study were under 18 years of age. To further support the medical community, we have launched an enhanced diagnostic pathway to optimize care for patients with LAL-D. This comprehensive yet simple diagnostic pathway guides physicians for the patients who had higher likelihood for LAL-D. For example, the new pathway will help pediatric specialist rapidly identify and diagnose children, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. And in children, liver and lipid abnormalities or more uncommon. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of patients progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onsets. 
Turning to Strensiq. Our HPP diagnostic pathway is also a critical element of our disease education and launch plans. The pathway is designed to help specialists recognize the key clinical manifestation of HPP and to raise awareness of low age and gender adjusted alkaline phosphatase or ALP activity as a biochemical hallmark for diagnosis. As we successfully PNH and aHUS, our single global metabolic field team is implementing our disease education and diagnostic programs to educate on the extreme rarity and life-threatening consequences of HPP and LAL-D. With the regulatory approvals of Strensiq in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada; and Kanuma in Europe, our single metabolic field team will educate physicians on the transformative treatment benefits as described in each of the product labels. We expect that overtime, our comprehensive launch will lead to a rapid and accurate diagnostic, so physicians can make informed treatment decisions. Turning to the timing of our in country launches for Strensiq. We will initially launch in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In the U.S., just days after the FDA approval, our nurse case managers have started to enroll initial HPP patients in 2 1 source. And for Kanuma, our metabolic field team in Germany is also and in the very early stages of launch. In the other major European countries, we are beginning the funding processes for Strensiq and Kanuma with health care authorities. We expect to begin serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. We're committed to working with governments around throughout Europe to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma. 
In closing, the commercial organization is at the strongest point in Alexion's history. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we will leverage our ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D globally. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our lead R&D programs. Martin?"

In the third quarter of 2015, we continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech with our portfolio of highly innovative product candidates in multiple therapeutic areas. We have several R&D catalysts to report in the fourth quarter and beyond. Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In neurology, we expect to have preliminary data in refractory myasthenia gravis in mid-2016 and are on track to complete enrollment in the relaxing optica trial next year. And in kidney transplant, we expect to complete enrollment in our registration trial in delayed graft function by the end of the year with preliminary data expected in 2016. Also in transplant, researchers will present updated one-year data from a single arm Phase II study of eculizumab in the prevention of acute Antibody-Mediated Rejection or AMR in synthesized deceased donor kidney transplant recipients in a latebreaking post session at the ASM meeting next week. In addition to eculizumab, we continue to develop a robust portfolio of innovative complement inhibitors. We advanced ALXN 1210, our lead to next-generation Soliris molecule, which is a lot directing antibody that is administered intravenously and suitable for monthly dosing. As a reminder, last quarter, the USPTO granted ALXN 1210 a composition patent in effect till March 2035. We are completing the multiple-ascending dose study of ALXN 1210 and are on track to initiate a proof-of-concept PNH trial by the end of the year.
Turning to ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C-5A. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune condition with significant mortality within the first to 100 days post transplant. The primary outcome measure of our Phase II study is 28-day GI-GVHD response rate, and we will present interim data from this study later this year. 
Turning now to our metabolic franchise and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is an enzyme replacement therapy administered intravenously for patients with doses 3B, or MPS IIIB, which is a rare devastating and progressive autothermal recessive liposomal storage disease caused by deficiency of . The enzyme deficiency leads to the buildup of the normal amounts of heparan sulfate in the brain and other organs. Patients with this systemic disease experience profound neuro cognitive abnormalities, including severe cognitive decline, behavioral problems, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. 
A Phase I/II trial of SBC-103 is ongoing and interim data measuring 3 months changes from baseline in heparan sulfate levels in neuron, blood serum and spinal fluid are expected this year. In Q3, we also completed enrollment in a natural history study to characterize the course of disease progression in patients with MPS IIIB. Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum core factor deficiency, or MLCD type A, are rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting new borns. We have completed our planned enrollment and the bridging study and the natural history study. We now plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of this year. Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa as potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role. E&PP1, and enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy or JC or other rarity sources of calcification. One of the mRNA rare disease progress from our collaboration with and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio. 
Following the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma, we are driving toward as many as 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018, including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules. I look forward to reporting on our upcoming catalyst at our Analyst Day on December 10. I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

And largely because they're highly challenging diseases and very few companies were really accepting the high risk associated with developing not just therapies that make an incremental difference but truly therapies that transform patients' lives. That's really what we're focused on. Our approach with Soliris and PNH and aHUS is very similar to now our approach with Strensiq for HPP and Kanuma for LAL-D. It really starts with: one, the extreme rarity of the diseases. You mentioned budget impacts. As I think we all know when the U.S. and Europe, there's a definition for the prevalence for an orphan disease. And it's typically around 200,000 patients with the disease. The definition for an ultra-orphan disease in the U.S. is, say, 6,400 patients. And when we look at the diseases in which we're focused on, the numbers generally fall far lower than even that very low threshold for ultra-orphan disease. When you combine that with natural history of these diseases, in PNH, 1/3 of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. For aHUS, 50% of patients will either die, progress to ESRD requiring dialysis or have permanent renal damage within 12 months of diagnosis. And then HPP and LAL-D as we reflected on a call, the majority of the youngest patients don't live till their first birthday. And when you combine that with truly transformative benefits, that is, for example, with Strensiq now, a 97% survival rate at 48 weeks compared to 42% for historical control patients. And then 100% of the juvenile onset HPP patients patient had a response to treatment in a variety of different measures of mobility and growth and bone healing. And so when we combine all of that, it gives us great confidence that just like we've experienced with Solaris in PNH and aHUS, it is a long process. It takes time country by country, but the underpinning of our approach of delivering through transformation has ultimately, resulted in successful reimbursement discussions. And we would expect it to be no different now for Strensiq and Kanuma as we move country-to-country across Europe?"

If you look at the macroeconomic situation in Latin America in Q3, you can see that the impact on most of the currencies in the countries have been significant in Q3. And that flows into Q4. And I just want to talk through this a little bit because you look at the currency impact and the guidance around $160 million earlier. And that continues till now. We have maintained $160 million currency impact going into Q4. Where you in Latin America countries, some of them we also sell in U.S. dollar. So what happens is, they make their own local budgets and their own local currencies. So you do go get into a constraint and we work with the government to find solutions around that. now these things are not it was. But if you think through this having 2/3 of your business globally, we kind of see this happening in one country or another once in a while. So if you go back and look at the 2014, we saw that in Russia or 1 or 2 quadrants we didn't feel the pain. And then we found solutions around 2015 and we moved forward. We will see this thing going forward. Now your other question, the last question that part of the question was impact of currency going into 2016. Yes, a large proportion. So we've almost had hedged 50% for currency under major currencies that we deal with. The other 50% is unhedged. But the hedge rates continue to drop and closer market-rate period.

Certainly, looking at heparan sulfate levels across all of those doses in the CNS urine and serum. And as you correctly allude to, the brain is clearly a key component of this disease.

In terms of 5500, it's still a very much part of our country have consummate inhibitors. And I've think both David and I alluded to. But now got this Roa portfolio complement inhibitors, both in the C-5 area with 1210 but other parts of the complement back, which is really growing in our hands. I must say in 1007 is obviously, one we talk about on a regular basis, both in gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease and lipid syndrome. So the case of talking more about 1210 is simply our lead program. It's further ahead in terms of the next-generation Soliris molecule. And we will be looking at published data set and patient data over the next period."

Q3 was a landmark quarter for Alexion as we firmly establish our leadership in serving patients with rare and devastating diseases. During the quarter, we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones. First, our com",1130,"Thank you, Elena. Q3 was a landmark quarter for Alexion as we firmly establish our leadership in serving patients with rare and devastating diseases. During the quarter, we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones. First, our commercial team continued to serve an increasing number of patients, with PNH and aHUS with Soliris; second, we received important regulatory approvals for Strensiq and Kanuma of establishing a platform to globally launch 2 new highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies; third, our R&D team continues to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech, with multiple key milestones expected in Q4 and beyond; and fourth, we had another quarter of strong financial performance. 
Looking first at our complement franchise in PNH. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS, in Q3, we once again reached a consistent number of new patients. The ongoing strength of our global rollout confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. We continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve new patients with PNH and aHUS ahead of us. 
In our metabolic franchise, as we just announced, the FDA-approved Strensiq under Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review for patients with perinatal, infantile and juvenile-onset HPP, a life-threatening ultrarare disease in which bone formation is incomplete, causing deformity of the skeleton, profound muscle weakness, seizures, severe pain and premature death. We are very pleased that the broad label for Strensiq will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. The label reflects the breakthrough medical innovation that Strensiq provides to patients and families. 
First, Strensiq-treated patients had overall survival of 97% compared to 42% for historical controlled patients of 48 weeks; second, 100% of juvenile-onset HPP patients responded to Strensiq treatment as measured by substantial bone healing compared to only 6% bone healing in the control group; third, 100% of treated patients had improvement in low weight or short statures or maintained normal height and weight; fourth, improvements in mobility were demonstrated in patients with juvenile-onset HPP. By 4 years of treatment, 100% of assessed patients achieved the 6 Minute Walk Test within the normal range for matched peers, whereas no patients were in the normal range at baseline prior to Strensiq treatment; and fifth, the label specifically includes extensive safety and efficacy data from 4 clinical studies with Strensiq treatment and patients for up to 6.5 years.
We are pleased that the broad and robust label reflects the transformative benefits of Strensiq for the very small number of patients who suffer from this chronic genetic metabolic disease. In Q3, we received regulatory approvals for Strensiq in the European Union, Japan and Canada. And like the U.S., the strong labels reflect the transformative benefits of Strensiq. As with PNH since 2007, our objective is that every patient with pediatric-onset HPP, who can benefit from Strensiq, will have access to Strensiq. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We received European approval for patients of all ages with LAL-D. The broad label includes a survival benefit in patients with the most rapid disease progression. 67% of infants treated with Kanuma survived beyond 12 months of age, whereas no infants in the historical control group survived past 8 months. In addition, the European label also includes clinical data in children and adults, demonstrating significant improvements in multiple disease manifestations, including markers of liver injury and liver fat content. In the U.S., Kanuma continues to be reviewed under the Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review with a PDUFA date of December 8. We submitted additional chemistry manufacturing and controls or CMC data last month in response to the FDA's request. As a reminder, the FDA did not request additional clinical data. We continue to have constructive discussions with the agency as we work toward bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in the U.S. as quickly as possible. Our commitment to patients and families with HPP and LAL-D reflects what we know well and do well, delivering breakthrough medical innovation to transform the lives of patients suffering from devastating and ultrarare diseases. Carsten will provide an update on our launch plans for Strensiq and Kanuma later in the call. As we transitioned in Q3 to a multiproduct company, we are advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. We distinguish ourselves with an exclusive focus on developing life-transforming therapies. We are excited about our early- and late-stage portfolio of highly innovative product candidates and expect up to 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018. In fact, we have multiple catalysts in our pipeline this quarter, including Phase I/II data for SBC-103, our innovative enzyme-replacement therapy for patients with MPS IIIB. Data from our Phase II study of ALXN 1007 in patients with GI-GVHD; initiation of a proof-of-concept PNH trial with ALXN 1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule; and completion of enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab and delayed graft function in kidney transplant. 
As we head into 2016, R&D milestones include data from the registration trial of eculizumab and refractory MG, data from ALXN 1210 in patients with PNH; completion of enrollment in the registration trial in refractory NMO; and progressing 4 preclinical programs into the clinic, including a messenger RNA therapy from our Moderna partnership and another additional complement inhibitor.
Turning to our financial performance. Product revenues in Q3 were $666 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2014 despite increased weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in Soliris volume compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Also, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Turning briefly to our 2015 guidance. This morning, we guided 2015 revenues to be in the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. Due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. 
Also this morning, we increased our EPS guidance for the year from $4.70 to $4.80 to a higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97, as a result of our strong Soliris growth, continued financial discipline and accelerated synergies from our recent Synageva acquisition. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We were pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by the combination of strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $667 million in Q3 or 20% above the year-ago quarter, and net product sales were $666 million in this quarter. 
This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by a 9% or $49 million in currency headwinds in Q3 over the year-ago quarter. Q3 revenues were driven by continued strong growth of Soliris, and we also booked our initial sale for Strensiq in the final weeks of the third quarter. We look forward to serving patients with HPP around the world. However, I would like to remind you that given the low incidence and high mortality of HPP, as well as the country by country rollout, we expect the launch trajectory of Strensiq to be slow and steady as we build a robust global metabolic franchise over time. 
During the quarter, we continue to invest in the global buildout of our metabolic franchise and in our broad pipeline, including operating costs from the Synageva acquisition. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $147 million or 22% of revenue, and third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $182 million or 27% of revenue. During Q3, we recognized greater synergies from the acquisition compared to our expectations, which benefited both R&D and SG&A spend in the quarter. We also benefited from $5.6 million from lower expenses due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 0.5%. As we announced on our Q2 call, our 2015 tax rate will benefit from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva. We incurred a onetime GAAP tax expense of approximately $316 million. This GAAP tax expense is attributable to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the restructuring of Synageva's intellectual property into our existing structure. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $3.5 billion in debt. Since we authorized our share repurchase program, we have to date purchased $215 million or 1.3 million shares. We currently have $785 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we will continue to buy back additional shares opportunistically. 
Turning to our 2015 guidance. We continue to forecast strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS of 28% for the full year and a very small contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma. We now expect 2015 revenues to be at the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. As a reminder, our 2015 revenue guidance includes an approximately negative 6% or $160 million foreign exchange impact compared to 2014 exchange rates. In addition, due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the year from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 to the higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97 as we accelerate synergies from our Synageva acquisition. 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenues of $697 million to $702 million. On a sequential basis, the Q4 revenue guidance includes a $5 million to $7 million negative currency impact. Operating expenses will be sequentially higher in Q4 due to the investment in the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12. In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter. We have continued to realize accelerated acquisition-related synergies earlier than expected, and we are on track to realize total annual synergies of at least $150 million in 2017. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

Our global commercial operations delivered a strong 29% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business. 
Starting with PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives drove steady growth. We are consistently identifying a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets such as Turkey, Brazil and Russia. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 16 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there has been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 4 years post-approval. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time, this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. To support the aHUS community, we continue to enhance our disease awareness programs, further underscored by new data that will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting next week. Researchers will present findings from a long-term follow-up study that demonstrated that the TMA event rate was 3.5x higher in patients who discontinued Soliris versus those who stayed on treatment. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of ongoing Soliris treatment in preventing life-threatening complement-mediated TMA in patients with aHUS, further highlighting the importance of long-term treatment for this genetic and chronic ultrarare disease. 
Now I would like to turn to our global metabolic launches. Starting with Kanuma, we are very pleased that the New England Journal of Medicine published our pivotal Phase III ARISE study in children and adults with LAL-D. Key findings showed that all patients treated with Kanuma had a reduction in liver transaminases or ALT levels, which is a key marker of disease activity and liver injury. Children and adults treated with Kanuma had significant improvements in disease-related lipids and liver abnormalities compared with placebo. And in addition, the accompanying editorial stated that LAL-D is a rapidly fatal condition, and that enzyme replacement therapies could be lifesaving and transformational for all patients with LAL-D. The New England Journal publication and editorial will support our disease education initiative with the LAL-D medical community. As a reminder, most patients in the ARISE study were under 18 years of age. To further support the medical community, we have launched an enhanced diagnostic pathway to optimize care for patients with LAL-D. This comprehensive yet simple diagnostic pathway guides physicians to the patients who had higher likelihood for LAL-D. For example, the new pathway will help pediatric specialists rapidly identify and diagnose children, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. And in children, liver and lipid abnormalities are more uncommon. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of patients progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onset. 
Turning to Strensiq. Our HPP diagnostic pathway is also a critical element of our disease education and launch plans. The pathway is designed to help specialists recognize the key clinical manifestations of HPP and to raise awareness of low age and gender-adjusted alkaline phosphatase, or ALP activity, as the biochemical hallmark for diagnosis. As we successfully rolled out with PNH and aHUS, our single global metabolic field team is implementing our disease education and diagnostic programs to educate on the extreme rarity and life-threatening consequences of HPP and LAL-D. With the regulatory approvals of Strensiq in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada; and Kanuma in Europe, our single metabolic field team will educate physicians on the transformative treatment benefits as described in each of the product labels. We expect that over time, our comprehensive launch plans will lead to a rapid and accurate diagnosis, so physicians can make better informed treatment decisions. 
Turning to the timing of our in-country launches for Strensiq. We will initially launch in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In the U.S., just days after the FDA approval, our nurse case managers have started to enroll initial HPP patients into OneSource. And for Kanuma, our metabolic field team in Germany is also in the very early stages of launch. In the other major European countries, we are beginning the funding processes for Strensiq and Kanuma with health care authorities. We expect to begin serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. We're committed to working with governments throughout Europe to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma. 
In closing, the commercial organization is at the strongest point in Alexion's history. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we will leverage our ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D globally. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our lead R&D programs. Martin?"

In the third quarter of 2015, we continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech with our portfolio of highly innovative product candidates in multiple therapeutic areas. We have several R&D catalysts to report in the fourth quarter and beyond. Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In neurology, we expect to have preliminary data in refractory myasthenia gravis in mid-2016 and are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica trial next year. And in kidney transplant, we expect to complete enrollment in our registration trial in delayed graft function by the end of the year with preliminary data expected in 2016. Also in transplant, researchers will present updated one-year data from a single arm Phase II study of eculizumab in the prevention of acute antibody-mediated rejection or AMR in sensitized deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients in a late-breaking post recession at the ASN meeting next week. In addition to eculizumab, we continue to develop a robust portfolio of innovative complement inhibitors. We advanced ALXN 1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, which is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that is administered intravenously and suitable for monthly dosing. As a reminder, last quarter, the USPTO granted ALXN 1210 a composition-of-matter patent in effect until March 2035. We are completing the multiple-ascending dose study of ALXN 1210 and are on track to initiate a proof-of-concept PNH trial by the end of the year.
Turning to ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C-5A. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft versus host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune condition with significant mortality within the first to 100 days post transplant. The primary outcome measure of our Phase II study is 28-day GI-GVHD response rate, and we will present interim data from this study later this year. 
Turning now to our metabolic franchise and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is an enzyme-replacement therapy administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, which is a rare, devastating and progressive autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of NAGLU. The enzyme deficiency leads to the buildup of abnormal amounts of heparan sulfate in the brain and other organs. Patients with this systemic disease experience profound neurocognitive abnormalities, including severe cognitive decline, behavioral problems, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. 
A Phase I/II trial of SBC-103 is ongoing and interim data, measuring 3-month changes from baseline in heparan sulfate levels in urine, blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid, are expected this year. In Q3, we also completed enrollment in a natural history study to characterize the course of disease progression in patients with MPS IIIB. 
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study and the natural history study. We now plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of this year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa as a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type-1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role. ENPP1, an enzyme-replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification. One of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio. 
Following the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma, we are driving toward as many as 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018, including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules. I look forward to reporting on our upcoming catalyst at our Analyst Day on December 10. I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

We, as you know, we've really approach diseases that for a very long time, there really has been no focused on them, and largely because they're highly challenging diseases and very few companies were really accepting the high risk associated with developing not just therapies that make an incremental difference, but truly therapies that transform patients' lives. That's really what we're focused on. And our approach with Soliris and PNH and aHUS is very similar to now our approach with Strensiq for HPP and Kanuma for LAL-D. And it really starts with: one, the extreme rarity of the diseases. And you mentioned budget impact. As I think we all know when the U.S. and Europe, there's a definition for the prevalence for an orphan disease. And it's typically around 200,000 patients with the disease. The definition for an ultra-orphan disease in the U.S. is, say, 6,400 patients. And when we look at the diseases in which we're focused on, the numbers generally fall far lower than even that very low threshold for an ultra-orphan disease. When you combine that with the natural history of these diseases, in PNH, 1/3 of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. For aHUS, 50% of patients will either die, progress to ESRD requiring dialysis or have permanent renal damage within 12 months of diagnosis. And then HPP and LAL-D as we reflected on a call, the majority of the youngest patients don't live till their first birthday. And when you combine that with truly transformative benefits, that is, for example, with Strensiq now, a 97% survival rate at 48 weeks compared to 42% for historical control patients. And then 100% of the juvenile-onset HPP patient had a response to treatment in a variety of different measures of mobility and growth and bone healing. And so when we combine all of that, it gives us great confidence that just like we've experienced with Soliris in PNH and aHUS, it is a long process. It takes time country by country, but the underpinning of our approach of delivering through transformation has ultimately, resulted in successful reimbursement discussions. And we would expect it to be no different now for Strensiq and Kanuma as we move country by country across Europe?"

So if you look at the macroeconomic situation in Latin America in Q3, you can see that the impact on most of the currencies in the countries have been significant in Q3. And that flows into Q4. And I just want to talk through this a little bit because if you look at the currency impact and the guidance that we gave around $160 million earlier, and that continues till now, we've maintained $160 million currency impact going into Q4. Where you see in Latin American countries, some of them we also sell in U.S. dollar. So what happens is, they make budget -- their own local budgets in local currencies. And so you do get into a constraint, and we work with the government to find solutions around that. Now these things are not new to us. Because if you think through this having 2/3 of your business globally, we kind of see this happening in one country or the other once in a while. So if you go back and look at 2014, we saw that in Russia over 1 or 2 quarters we didn't feel the pain. And then we found solutions around 2015, and we moved forward.

That's where we first gained our experience with dose by weight. Then the youngest patients with aHUS are actually only consume about 20% of the dose that the adults would consume. And so -- and again, Pediatrics are heavily involved in aHUS. So when you blend it all together, the average per patient is very similar to that of our PNH experience.

In Q3, as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS, in Q3, we once again reached a consistent number of new patients. The ongoing strength of our global rollout confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. We continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve new patients with PNH and aHUS ahead of us. 
In our metabolic franchise, as we just announced, the FDA-approved Strensiq under Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review for patients with perinatal, infantile and juvenile-onset HPP, a life-threatening ultrarare disease in which bone formation is incomplete, causing deformity of the skeleton, profound muscle weakness, seizures, severe pain and premature death. We are very pleased that the broad label for Strensiq will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. The label reflects the breakthrough medical innovation that Strensiq provides to patients and families. 
First, Strensiq-treated patients had overall survival of 97% compared to 42% for historical controlled patients of 48 weeks; second, 100% of juvenile-onset HPP patients responded to Strensiq treatment as measured by substantial bone healing compared to only 6% bone healing in the control group; third, 100% of treated patients had improvement in low weight or short statures or maintained normal height and weight; fourth, improvements in mobility were demonstrated in patients with juvenile-onset HPP. By 4 years of treatment, 100% of assessed patients achieved the 6 Minute Walk Test within the normal range for matched peers, whereas no patients were in the normal range at baseline prior to Strensiq treatment; and fifth, the label specifically includes extensive safety and efficacy data from 4 clinical studies with Strensiq treatment and patients for up to 6.5 years.
We are pleased that the broad and robust label reflects the transformative benefits of Strensiq for the very small number of patients who suffer from this chronic genetic metabolic disease. In Q3, we received regulatory approvals for Strensiq in the European Union, Japan and Canada. And like the U.S., the strong labels reflect the transformative benefits of Strensiq. As with PNH since 2007, our objective is that every patient with pediatric-onset HPP, who can benefit from Strensiq, will have access to Strensiq. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We received European approval for patients of all ages with LAL-D. The broad label includes a survival benefit in patients with the most rapid disease progression. 67% of infants treated with Kanuma survived beyond 12 months of age, whereas no infants in the historical control group survived past 8 months. In addition, the European label also includes clinical data in children and adults, demonstrating significant improvements in multiple disease manifestations, including markers of liver injury and liver fat content. In the U.S., Kanuma continues to be reviewed under the Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review with a PDUFA date of December 8. We submitted additional chemistry manufacturing and controls or CMC data last month in response to the FDA's request. As a reminder, the FDA did not request additional clinical data. We continue to have constructive discussions with the agency as we work toward bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in the U.S. as quickly as possible. Our commitment to patients and families with HPP and LAL-D reflects what we know well and do well, delivering breakthrough medical innovation to transform the lives of patients suffering from devastating and ultrarare diseases. Carsten will provide an update on our launch plans for Strensiq and Kanuma later in the call. As we transitioned in Q3 to a multiproduct company, we are advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. We distinguish ourselves with an exclusive focus on developing life-transforming therapies. We are excited about our early- and late-stage portfolio of highly innovative product candidates and expect up to 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018. In fact, we have multiple catalysts in our pipeline this quarter, including Phase I/II data for SBC-103, our innovative enzyme-replacement therapy for patients with MPS IIIB. Data from our Phase II study of ALXN 1007 in patients with GI-GVHD; initiation of a proof-of-concept PNH trial with ALXN 1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule; and completion of enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab and delayed graft function in kidney transplant. 
As we head into 2016, R&D milestones include data from the registration trial of eculizumab and refractory MG, data from ALXN 1210 in patients with PNH; completion of enrollment in the registration trial in refractory NMO; and progressing 4 preclinical programs into the clinic, including a messenger RNA therapy from our Moderna partnership and another additional complement inhibitor.
Turning to our financial performance. Product revenues in Q3 were $666 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2014 despite increased weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in Soliris volume compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Also, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Turning briefly to our 2015 guidance. This morning, we guided 2015 revenues to be in the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. Due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. 
Also this morning, we increased our EPS guidance for the year from $4.70 to $4.80 to a higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97, as a result of our strong Soliris growth, continued financial discipline and accelerated synergies from our recent Synageva acquisition. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We were pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by the combination of strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $667 million in Q3 or 20% above the year-ago quarter, and net product sales were $666 million in this quarter. 
This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by a 9% or $49 million in currency headwinds in Q3 over the year-ago quarter. Q3 revenues were driven by continued strong growth of Soliris, and we also booked our initial sale for Strensiq in the final weeks of the third quarter. We look forward to serving patients with HPP around the world. However, I would like to remind you that given the low incidence and high mortality of HPP, as well as the country by country rollout, we expect the launch trajectory of Strensiq to be slow and steady as we build a robust global metabolic franchise over time. 
During the quarter, we continue to invest in the global buildout of our metabolic franchise and in our broad pipeline, including operating costs from the Synageva acquisition. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $147 million or 22% of revenue, and third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $182 million or 27% of revenue. During Q3, we recognized greater synergies from the acquisition compared to our expectations, which benefited both R&D and SG&A spend in the quarter. We also benefited from $5.6 million from lower expenses due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 0.5%. As we announced on our Q2 call, our 2015 tax rate will benefit from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva. We incurred a onetime GAAP tax expense of approximately $316 million. This GAAP tax expense is attributable to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the restructuring of Synageva's intellectual property into our existing structure. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $3.5 billion in debt. Since we authorized our share repurchase program, we have to date purchased $215 million or 1.3 million shares. We currently have $785 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we will continue to buy back additional shares opportunistically. 
Turning to our 2015 guidance. We continue to forecast strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS of 28% for the full year and a very small contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma. We now expect 2015 revenues to be at the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. As a reminder, our 2015 revenue guidance includes an approximately negative 6% or $160 million foreign exchange impact compared to 2014 exchange rates. In addition, due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the year from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 to the higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97 as we accelerate synergies from our Synageva acquisition. 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenues of $697 million to $702 million. On a sequential basis, the Q4 revenue guidance includes a $5 million to $7 million negative currency impact. Operating expenses will be sequentially higher in Q4 due to the investment in the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12. In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter. We have continued to realize accelerated acquisition-related synergies earlier than expected, and we are on track to realize total annual synergies of at least $150 million in 2017. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

Starting with PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives drove steady grow",906,"Thank you, Vikas. Our global commercial operations delivered a strong 29% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business. 
Starting with PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives drove steady growth. We are consistently identifying a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets such as Turkey, Brazil and Russia. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 16 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there has been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 4 years post-approval. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time, this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. To support the aHUS community, we continue to enhance our disease awareness programs, further underscored by new data that will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting next week. Researchers will present findings from a long-term follow-up study that demonstrated that the TMA event rate was 3.5x higher in patients who discontinued Soliris versus those who stayed on treatment. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of ongoing Soliris treatment in preventing life-threatening complement-mediated TMA in patients with aHUS, further highlighting the importance of long-term treatment for this genetic and chronic ultrarare disease. 
Now I would like to turn to our global metabolic launches. Starting with Kanuma, we are very pleased that the New England Journal of Medicine published our pivotal Phase III ARISE study in children and adults with LAL-D. Key findings showed that all patients treated with Kanuma had a reduction in liver transaminases or ALT levels, which is a key marker of disease activity and liver injury. Children and adults treated with Kanuma had significant improvements in disease-related lipids and liver abnormalities compared with placebo. And in addition, the accompanying editorial stated that LAL-D is a rapidly fatal condition, and that enzyme replacement therapies could be lifesaving and transformational for all patients with LAL-D. The New England Journal publication and editorial will support our disease education initiative with the LAL-D medical community. As a reminder, most patients in the ARISE study were under 18 years of age. To further support the medical community, we have launched an enhanced diagnostic pathway to optimize care for patients with LAL-D. This comprehensive yet simple diagnostic pathway guides physicians to the patients who had higher likelihood for LAL-D. For example, the new pathway will help pediatric specialists rapidly identify and diagnose children, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. And in children, liver and lipid abnormalities are more uncommon. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of patients progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onset. 
Turning to Strensiq. Our HPP diagnostic pathway is also a critical element of our disease education and launch plans. The pathway is designed to help specialists recognize the key clinical manifestations of HPP and to raise awareness of low age and gender-adjusted alkaline phosphatase, or ALP activity, as the biochemical hallmark for diagnosis. As we successfully rolled out with PNH and aHUS, our single global metabolic field team is implementing our disease education and diagnostic programs to educate on the extreme rarity and life-threatening consequences of HPP and LAL-D. With the regulatory approvals of Strensiq in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada; and Kanuma in Europe, our single metabolic field team will educate physicians on the transformative treatment benefits as described in each of the product labels. We expect that over time, our comprehensive launch plans will lead to a rapid and accurate diagnosis, so physicians can make better informed treatment decisions. 
Turning to the timing of our in-country launches for Strensiq. We will initially launch in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In the U.S., just days after the FDA approval, our nurse case managers have started to enroll initial HPP patients into OneSource. And for Kanuma, our metabolic field team in Germany is also in the very early stages of launch. In the other major European countries, we are beginning the funding processes for Strensiq and Kanuma with health care authorities. We expect to begin serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. We're committed to working with governments throughout Europe to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma. 
In closing, the commercial organization is at the strongest point in Alexion's history. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we will leverage our ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D globally. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our lead R&D programs. Martin?"

In the third quarter of 2015, we continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech with our portfolio of highly innovative product candidates in multiple therapeutic areas. We have several R&D catalysts to report in the fourth quarter and beyond. Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In neurology, we expect to have preliminary data in refractory myasthenia gravis in mid-2016 and are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica trial next year. And in kidney transplant, we expect to complete enrollment in our registration trial in delayed graft function by the end of the year with preliminary data expected in 2016. Also in transplant, researchers will present updated one-year data from a single arm Phase II study of eculizumab in the prevention of acute antibody-mediated rejection or AMR in sensitized deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients in a late-breaking post recession at the ASN meeting next week. In addition to eculizumab, we continue to develop a robust portfolio of innovative complement inhibitors. We advanced ALXN 1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, which is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that is administered intravenously and suitable for monthly dosing. As a reminder, last quarter, the USPTO granted ALXN 1210 a composition-of-matter patent in effect until March 2035. We are completing the multiple-ascending dose study of ALXN 1210 and are on track to initiate a proof-of-concept PNH trial by the end of the year.
Turning to ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C-5A. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft versus host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune condition with significant mortality within the first 100 days post transplant. The primary outcome measure of our Phase II study is 28-day GI-GVHD response rate, and we will present interim data from this study later this year. 
Turning now to our metabolic franchise and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is an enzyme-replacement therapy administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, which is a rare, devastating and progressive autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of NAGLU. The enzyme deficiency leads to the buildup of abnormal amounts of heparan sulfate in the brain and other organs. Patients with this systemic disease experience profound neurocognitive abnormalities, including severe cognitive decline, behavioral problems, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. 
A Phase I/II trial of SBC-103 is ongoing and interim data, measuring 3-month changes from baseline in heparan sulfate levels in urine, blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid, are expected this year. In Q3, we also completed enrollment in a natural history study to characterize the course of disease progression in patients with MPS IIIB. 
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study and the natural history study. We now plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of this year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa as a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type-1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role. ENPP1, an enzyme-replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification. One of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio. 
Following the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma, we are driving toward as many as 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018, including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules. I look forward to reporting on our upcoming catalyst at our Analyst Day on December 10. I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

We, as you know, we've really approach diseases that for a very long time, there really has been no focused on them, and largely because they're highly challenging diseases and very few companies were really accepting the high risk associated with developing not just therapies that make an incremental difference, but truly therapies that transform patients' lives. That's really what we're focused on. And our approach with Soliris and PNH and aHUS is very similar to now our approach with Strensiq for HPP and Kanuma for LAL-D. And it really starts with: one, the extreme rarity of the diseases. And you mentioned budget impact. As I think we all know when the U.S. and Europe, there's a definition for the prevalence for an orphan disease. And it's typically around 200,000 patients with the disease. The definition for an ultra-orphan disease in the U.S. is, say, 6,400 patients. And when we look at the diseases in which we're focused on, the numbers generally fall far lower than even that very low threshold for an ultra-orphan disease. When you combine that with the natural history of these diseases, in PNH, 1/3 of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. For aHUS, 50% of patients will either die, progress to ESRD requiring dialysis or have permanent renal damage within 12 months of diagnosis. And then HPP and LAL-D as we reflected on a call, the majority of the youngest patients don't live till their first birthday. And when you combine that with truly transformative benefits, that is, for example, with Strensiq now, a 97% survival rate at 48 weeks compared to 42% for historical control patients. And then 100% of the juvenile-onset HPP patient had a response to treatment in a variety of different measures of mobility and growth and bone healing. And so when we combine all of that, it gives us great confidence that just like we've experienced with Soliris in PNH and aHUS, it is a long process. It takes time country by country, but the underpinning of our approach of delivering through transformation has ultimately, resulted in successful reimbursement discussions. And we would expect it to be no different now for Strensiq and Kanuma as we move country by country across Europe?"

And",301,"Thank for that question. This is Vikas here trying to respond to your questions. So if you look at the macroeconomic situation in Latin America in Q3, you can see that the impact on most of the currencies in the countries have been significant in Q3. And that flows into Q4. And I just want to talk through this a little bit because if you look at the currency impact and the guidance that we gave around $160 million earlier, and that continues till now, we've maintained $160 million currency impact going into Q4. Where you see in Latin American countries, some of them we also sell in U.S. dollar. So what happens is, they make budget -- their own local budgets in local currencies. And so you do get into a constraint, and we work with the government to find solutions around that. Now these things are not new to us. Because if you think through this having 2/3 of your business globally, we kind of see this happening in one country or the other once in a while. So if you go back and look at 2014, we saw that in Russia over 1 or 2 quarters we didn't feel the pain. And then we found solutions around 2015, and we moved forward. So we will see this thing going forward. Now your other question, the last question that part of the question was impact of currency going into 2016. Yes, a large proportion. So we almost hedged 50% of our currency under major currencies that we deal with. But other 50% is unhedged. But the hedge rates continue to drop and come towards closer to market rate over period. I'll give a better view of that towards the Analyst Day and as we give that guidance for 2016."

I think it's a really great question, actually. And how we look at this, and again, the part answer was in your question about where we expect to see things. As you know, just to take half a step backwards, there are 3 doses in the study with 11 patients at 0.31 and 0.3 milligrams per kilogram. Certainly, looking at heparan sulfate levels across all of those doses in the CNS, urine and serum. And as you correctly allude to, the brain is clearly a key component of this disease. And I mentioned the neurocognitive decline, neurodegeneration occurs. So clearly, if we were able to see dose-dependent results from the cerebrospinal fluid, that would be something that would excite us before planning future studies in this disease.

That's where we first gained our experience with dose by weight. Then the youngest patients with aHUS are actually only consume about 20% of the dose that the adults would consume.

I must say in 1007 is obviously, one that we talk about on a regular basis, both in gastrointestinal graft versus host disease and antiphospholipid syndrome.

Q3 was a landmark quarter for Alexion as we firmly establish our leadership in serving patients with rare and devastating diseases.

Q3 was a landmark quarter for Alexion as we firmly establish our leadership in serving patients with rare and devastating diseases. During the quarter, we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones. First, our commercial team continued to serve an increasing number of patients, with PNH and aHUS with Soliris; second, we received important regulatory approvals for Strensiq and Kanuma of establishing a platform to globally launch 2 new highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies; third, our R&D team continues to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech, with multiple key milestones expected in Q4 and beyond; and fourth, we had another quarter of strong financial performance. 
Looking first at our complement franchise in PNH. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS, in Q3, we once again reached a consistent number of new patients. The ongoing strength of our global rollout confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. We continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve new patients with PNH and aHUS ahead of us. 
In our metabolic franchise, as we just announced, the FDA-approved Strensiq under Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review for patients with perinatal, infantile and juvenile-onset HPP, a life-threatening ultrarare disease in which bone formation is incomplete, causing deformity of the skeleton, profound muscle weakness, seizures, severe pain and premature death. We are very pleased that the broad label for Strensiq will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. The label reflects the breakthrough medical innovation that Strensiq provides to patients and families. 
First, Strensiq-treated patients had overall survival of 97% compared to 42% for historical controlled patients of 48 weeks; second, 100% of juvenile-onset HPP patients responded to Strensiq treatment as measured by substantial bone healing compared to only 6% bone healing in the control group; third, 100% of treated patients had improvement in low weight or short statures or maintained normal height and weight; fourth, improvements in mobility were demonstrated in patients with juvenile-onset HPP. By 4 years of treatment, 100% of assessed patients achieved the 6 Minute Walk Test within the normal range for matched peers, whereas no patients were in the normal range at baseline prior to Strensiq treatment; and fifth, the label specifically includes extensive safety and efficacy data from 4 clinical studies with Strensiq treatment and patients for up to 6.5 years.
We are pleased that the broad and robust label reflects the transformative benefits of Strensiq for the very small number of patients who suffer from this chronic genetic metabolic disease. In Q3, we received regulatory approvals for Strensiq in the European Union, Japan and Canada. And like the U.S., the strong labels reflect the transformative benefits of Strensiq. As with PNH since 2007, our objective is that every patient with pediatric-onset HPP, who can benefit from Strensiq, will have access to Strensiq. 
Turning now to Kanuma. We received European approval for patients of all ages with LAL-D. The broad label includes a survival benefit in patients with the most rapid disease progression. 67% of infants treated with Kanuma survived beyond 12 months of age, whereas no infants in the historical control group survived past 8 months. In addition, the European label also includes clinical data in children and adults, demonstrating significant improvements in multiple disease manifestations, including markers of liver injury and liver fat content. In the U.S., Kanuma continues to be reviewed under the Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review with a PDUFA date of December 8. We submitted additional chemistry manufacturing and controls or CMC data last month in response to the FDA's request. As a reminder, the FDA did not request additional clinical data. We continue to have constructive discussions with the agency as we work toward bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in the U.S. as quickly as possible. Our commitment to patients and families with HPP and LAL-D reflects what we know well and do well, delivering breakthrough medical innovation to transform the lives of patients suffering from devastating and ultrarare diseases. Carsten will provide an update on our launch plans for Strensiq and Kanuma later in the call. As we transitioned in Q3 to a multiproduct company, we are advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. We distinguish ourselves with an exclusive focus on developing life-transforming therapies. We are excited about our early- and late-stage portfolio of highly innovative product candidates and expect up to 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018. In fact, we have multiple catalysts in our pipeline this quarter, including Phase I/II data for SBC-103, our innovative enzyme-replacement therapy for patients with MPS IIIB. Data from our Phase II study of ALXN 1007 in patients with GI-GVHD; initiation of a proof-of-concept PNH trial with ALXN 1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule; and completion of enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab and delayed graft function in kidney transplant. 
As we head into 2016, R&D milestones include data from the registration trial of eculizumab and refractory MG, data from ALXN 1210 in patients with PNH; completion of enrollment in the registration trial in refractory NMO; and progressing 4 preclinical programs into the clinic, including a messenger RNA therapy from our Moderna partnership and another additional complement inhibitor.
Turning to our financial performance. Product revenues in Q3 were $666 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2014 despite increased weakness in x U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in Soliris volume compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Also, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Turning briefly to our 2015 guidance. This morning, we guided 2015 revenues to be in the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. Due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. 
Also this morning, we increased our EPS guidance for the year from $4.70 to $4.80 to a higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97, as a result of our strong Soliris growth, continued financial discipline and accelerated synergies from our recent Synageva acquisition. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?"

We were pleased with our financial performance in Q3, driven by the combination of strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. Total revenues increased to $667 million in Q3 or 20% above the year-ago quarter, and net product sales were $666 million in this quarter. 
This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by a 9% or $49 million in currency headwinds in Q3 over the year-ago quarter. Q3 revenues were driven by continued strong growth of Soliris, and we also booked our initial sale for Strensiq in the final weeks of the third quarter. We look forward to serving patients with HPP around the world. However, I would like to remind you that given the low incidence and high mortality of HPP, as well as the country by country rollout, we expect the launch trajectory of Strensiq to be slow and steady as we build a robust global metabolic franchise over time. 
During the quarter, we continue to invest in the global buildout of our metabolic franchise and in our broad pipeline, including operating costs from the Synageva acquisition. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $147 million or 22% of revenue, and third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $182 million or 27% of revenue. During Q3, we recognized greater synergies from the acquisition compared to our expectations, which benefited both R&D and SG&A spend in the quarter. We also benefited from $5.6 million from lower expenses due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 0.5%. As we announced on our Q2 call, our 2015 tax rate will benefit from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva. We incurred a onetime GAAP tax expense of approximately $316 million. This GAAP tax expense is attributable to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the restructuring of Synageva's intellectual property into our existing structure. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. 
Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $3.5 billion in debt. Since we authorized our share repurchase program, we have to date purchased $215 million or 1.3 million shares. We currently have $785 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we will continue to buy back additional shares opportunistically. 
Turning to our 2015 guidance. We continue to forecast strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS of 28% for the full year and a very small contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma. We now expect 2015 revenues to be at the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. As a reminder, our 2015 revenue guidance includes an approximately negative 6% or $160 million foreign exchange impact compared to 2014 exchange rates. In addition, due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD, which is due to local government budgetary constraints. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the year from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 to the higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97 as we accelerate synergies from our Synageva acquisition. 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenues of $697 million to $702 million. On a sequential basis, the Q4 revenue guidance includes a $5 million to $7 million negative currency impact. Operating expenses will be sequentially higher in Q4 due to the investment in the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12. In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter. We have continued to realize accelerated acquisition-related synergies earlier than expected, and we are on track to realize total annual synergies of at least $150 million in 2017. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?"

Our global commercial operations delivered a strong 29% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business. 
Starting with PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives drove steady growth. We are consistently identifying a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets such as Turkey, Brazil and Russia. Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 16 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there has been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe 4 years post-approval. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time, this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. To support the aHUS community, we continue to enhance our disease awareness programs, further underscored by new data that will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting next week. Researchers will present findings from a long-term follow-up study that demonstrated that the TMA event rate was 3.5x higher in patients who discontinued Soliris versus those who stayed on treatment. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of ongoing Soliris treatment in preventing life-threatening complement-mediated TMA in patients with aHUS, further highlighting the importance of long-term treatment for this genetic and chronic ultrarare disease. 
Now I would like to turn to our global metabolic launches. Starting with Kanuma, we are very pleased that the New England Journal of Medicine published our pivotal Phase III ARISE study in children and adults with LAL-D. Key findings showed that all patients treated with Kanuma had a reduction in liver transaminases or ALT levels, which is a key marker of disease activity and liver injury. Children and adults treated with Kanuma had significant improvements in disease-related lipids and liver abnormalities compared with placebo. And in addition, the accompanying editorial stated that LAL-D is a rapidly fatal condition, and that enzyme replacement therapies could be lifesaving and transformational for all patients with LAL-D. The New England Journal publication and editorial will support our disease education initiative with the LAL-D medical community. As a reminder, most patients in the ARISE study were under 18 years of age. To further support the medical community, we have launched an enhanced diagnostic pathway to optimize care for patients with LAL-D. This comprehensive yet simple diagnostic pathway guides physicians to the patients who had higher likelihood for LAL-D. For example, the new pathway will help pediatric specialists rapidly identify and diagnose children, which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. And in children, liver and lipid abnormalities are more uncommon. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of patients progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just 3 years of symptom onset. 
Turning to Strensiq. Our HPP diagnostic pathway is also a critical element of our disease education and launch plans. The pathway is designed to help specialists recognize the key clinical manifestations of HPP and to raise awareness of low age and gender-adjusted alkaline phosphatase, or ALP activity, as the biochemical hallmark for diagnosis. As we successfully rolled out with PNH and aHUS, our single global metabolic field team is implementing our disease education and diagnostic programs to educate on the extreme rarity and life-threatening consequences of HPP and LAL-D. With the regulatory approvals of Strensiq in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada; and Kanuma in Europe, our single metabolic field team will educate physicians on the transformative treatment benefits as described in each of the product labels. We expect that over time, our comprehensive launch plans will lead to a rapid and accurate diagnosis, so physicians can make better informed treatment decisions. 
Turning to the timing of our in-country launches for Strensiq. We will initially launch in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In the U.S., just days after the FDA approval, our nurse case managers have started to enroll initial HPP patients into OneSource. And for Kanuma, our metabolic field team in Germany is also in the very early stages of launch. In the other major European countries, we are beginning the funding processes for Strensiq and Kanuma with health care authorities. We expect to begin serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016, with additional countries to follow in 2017. We're committed to working with governments throughout Europe to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma. 
In closing, the commercial organization is at the strongest point in Alexion's history. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS. And we will leverage our ultrarare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D globally. 
Now I will turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our lead R&D programs. Martin?"

In the third quarter of 2015, we continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech with our portfolio of highly innovative product candidates in multiple therapeutic areas. We have several R&D catalysts to report in the fourth quarter and beyond. Starting with eculizumab, our 3 ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In neurology, we expect to have preliminary data in refractory myasthenia gravis in mid-2016 and are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica trial next year. And in kidney transplant, we expect to complete enrollment in our registration trial in delayed graft function by the end of the year with preliminary data expected in 2016. Also in transplant, researchers will present updated one-year data from a single arm Phase II study of eculizumab in the prevention of acute antibody-mediated rejection or AMR in sensitized deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients in a late-breaking post recession at the ASN meeting next week. In addition to eculizumab, we continue to develop a robust portfolio of innovative complement inhibitors. We advanced ALXN 1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, which is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that is administered intravenously and suitable for monthly dosing. As a reminder, last quarter, the USPTO granted ALXN 1210 a composition-of-matter patent in effect until March 2035. We are completing the multiple-ascending dose study of ALXN 1210 and are on track to initiate a proof-of-concept PNH trial by the end of the year.
Turning to ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C-5A. We progressed our Phase II study in patients with gastrointestinal graft versus host disease, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune condition with significant mortality within the first 100 days post transplant. The primary outcome measure of our Phase II study is 28-day GI-GVHD response rate, and we will present interim data from this study later this year. 
Turning now to our metabolic franchise and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is an enzyme-replacement therapy administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, or MPS IIIB, which is a rare, devastating and progressive autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of NAGLU. The enzyme deficiency leads to the buildup of abnormal amounts of heparan sulfate in the brain and other organs. Patients with this systemic disease experience profound neurocognitive abnormalities, including severe cognitive decline, behavioral problems, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. 
A Phase I/II trial of SBC-103 is ongoing and interim data, measuring 3-month changes from baseline in heparan sulfate levels in urine, blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid, are expected this year. In Q3, we also completed enrollment in a natural history study to characterize the course of disease progression in patients with MPS IIIB. 
Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study and the natural history study. We now plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of this year. 
Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect 4 of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa as a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type-1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role. ENPP1, an enzyme-replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification. One of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio. 
Following the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma, we are driving toward as many as 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018, including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules. I look forward to reporting on our upcoming catalyst at our Analyst Day on December 10. I will now turn the call back to David. David?"

So on the Kanuma diagnostic pathway, what you've seen on the slide is the cornerstones of this pathway is the lipid abnormalities and the liver abnormalities that are consistent with LAL-D disease. The diagnostic pathway looks at other diseases that are suspected. And if specialists were to follow those, it would lead not only to a misdiagnosis, but also to mistreatment. Essentially, in our medical education that specialists recognize the urgency and importance of conducting a dried blood spot test. This is a simple test that can turn around in short time and provides a definitive answer to the correct diagnosis of LAL-D."

We, as you know, we've really approach diseases that for a very long time, there really has been no focused on them, and largely because they're highly challenging diseases and very few companies were really accepting the high risk associated with developing not just therapies that make an incremental difference, but truly therapies that transform patients' lives. That's really what we're focused on. And our approach with Soliris and PNH and aHUS is very similar to now our approach with Strensiq for HPP and Kanuma for LAL-D. And it really starts with: one, the extreme rarity of the diseases. And you mentioned budget impact. As I think we all know when the U.S. and Europe, there's a definition for the prevalence for an orphan disease. And it's typically around 200,000 patients with the disease. The definition for an ultra-orphan disease in the U.S. is, say, 6,400 patients. And when we look at the diseases in which we're focused on, the numbers generally fall far lower than even that very low threshold for an ultra-orphan disease. When you combine that with the natural history of these diseases, in PNH, 1/3 of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. For aHUS, 50% of patients will either die, progress to ESRD requiring dialysis or have permanent renal damage within 12 months of diagnosis. And then HPP and LAL-D as we reflected on a call, the majority of the youngest patients don't live till their first birthday. And when you combine that with truly transformative benefits, that is, for example, with Strensiq now, a 97% survival rate at 48 weeks compared to 42% for historical control patients. And then 100% of the juvenile-onset HPP patient had a response to treatment in a variety of different measures of mobility and growth and bone healing. And so when we combine all of that, it gives us great confidence that just like we've experienced with Soliris in PNH and aHUS, it is a long process. It takes time country by country, but the underpinning of our approach of delivering through transformation has ultimately, resulted in successful reimbursement discussions. And we would expect it to be no different now for Strensiq and Kanuma as we move country by country across Europe?"

So if you look at the macroeconomic situation in Latin America in Q3, you can see that the impact on most of the currencies in the countries have been significant in Q3. And that flows into Q4. And I just want to talk through this a little bit because if you look at the currency impact and the guidance that we gave around $160 million earlier, and that continues till now, we've maintained $160 million currency impact going into Q4. Where you see in Latin American countries, some of them we also sell in U.S. dollar. So what happens is, they make budget -- their own local budgets in local currencies. And so you do get into a constraint, and we work with the government to find solutions around that. Now these things are not new to us. Because if you think through this having 2/3 of your business globally, we kind of see this happening in one country or the other once in a while. So if you go back and look at 2014, we saw that in Russia over 1 or 2 quarters we didn't feel the pain. And then we found solutions around 2015, and we moved forward. So we will see this thing going forward. Now your other question, the last question that part of the question was impact of currency going into 2016. Yes, a large proportion. So we almost hedged 50% of our currency under major currencies that we deal with. But other 50% is unhedged. But the hedge rates continue to drop and come towards closer to market rate over period. I'll give a better view of that towards the Analyst Day and as we give that guidance for 2016."

As you know, just to take half a step backwards, there are 3 doses in the study with 11 patients at 0.31 and 0.3 milligrams per kilogram. Certainly, looking at heparan sulfate levels across all of those doses in the CNS, urine and serum. And as you correctly allude to, the brain is clearly a key component of this disease. And I mentioned the neurocognitive decline, neurodegeneration occurs. So clearly, if we were able to see dose-dependent results from the cerebrospinal fluid, that would be something that would excite us before planning future studies in this disease.

And when you start looking at that, we are somewhere around 27%, 26% level. We expect to continue at the same percentage level going into next year, primarily because we have to invest in making the metabolic franchise a success. And we've got to put our full power behind Strensiq and Kanuma. So that's how we are thinking about SG&A in next year. And the leverage will start coming as the sales of these drugs start coming into the model over the years."

But I agree, it just kind of felt like a very long week for many of us. But this week, as we mentioned, given the clinical trial experience across multiple multinational trials and also the very early experience we've had in Japan, in Germany, our expectation is that a very, very high proportion of patients initiating Strensiq treatment will be infants and young children.
