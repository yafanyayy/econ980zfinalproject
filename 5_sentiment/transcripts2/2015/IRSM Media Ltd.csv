Welcome to our call. This is the Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer, and I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Mike Kiepura, President of our Packaging Solutions business. During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We described these risk is in our filings with the SEC, this includes our most recent 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2014. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of this non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentations available on our website. 
I'm going to start by discussing our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and various financial measures. I'll complete our prepared remarks with comments on the status of the merger of MWV and the outlook, then Ward, Jim and Mike and I will be available for your questions.
The RockTenn continued to deliver solid operating results in the March quarter. Adjusted earnings of editing $0.85 per share, were 35% higher than last year's adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share. This improvement was driven by strong results in our corrugated packaging segments, where segment income increased 28% over last year. This increase was a result of strong external demand in corrugated and solid commercial execution and operational improvement in our mills and box plan system. Additionally, we benefited from lower commodity cost. We were negatively affected by the combination of a substantial electrical failure at the Panama City mill and severe weather in February. These negative factors reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. We've seen our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis since the second half of September 2014. This trend continued during the December and March quarters for both RockTenn and overall industry. RockTenn's March quarter box shipments increased 5.4% on an equivalent per day basis and actual shipments increased 3.7%, both of these are as compared to the prior year. There was 1 less shipping day in the quarter of this year versus last year, and both numbers significantly exceeded the comparable industry numbers. We also saw very good end market demand in our folding carton business, where volumes up 1.1% compared to the prior-year quarter. Performance in our merchandising display business is not meeting our expectations. Segment income for the quarter was $12 million less than last quarter. I will speak to our display segment in more detail later in these prepared remarks. 
Our adjusted EPS of $0.85 is higher than the updated guidance range we provided at the end of March, while are performance exceeded these expectations, I'd prefer that we not see this amount of difference between our actual and estimated results, particularly this late in the quarter. We are right away update our forecast each month and in this circumstance, we faced a series of negative events during February in the 1st of March. This negative events included weather impacts of natural gas at 4 of our large mills, where service was unexpectedly curtailed, the electrical issue at Panama City and decline in demand for promotional displays. The cumulative impact of these events caused us to reduce our expectations, and with those facts, I felt compelled to update to our guidance. While we were reducing our expectations, we benefited from a number of positive factors during the last week of March, including strong demand and operational performance in excess of our expectations across all of our businesses, particularly in our mills. The roughly $0.10 difference between our reported results in the top end of the revised guidance range, to about 1/3 better mill and plant performance, 1/3 sales and 1/3 forecast conservatism.
Net sales of $2.5 billion, were 3% higher than last year's March quarter. The mill acquisition, which was completed in May of last year, the strong plant performance contributed to the revenue increase. RockTenn's credit agreement EBITDA of $1.6 billion for the last 12 months was $66 million or 4% higher than last year's quarter. We generated strong free cash flow of a $1.11 per share. We will absolutely maintain our focus on the strong free cash flow generation after the merger is complete. We ended the March quarter with an leverage of 1.74x, and our balance sheet is in great shape as we get closer to completing our merger with MWV.
Demand for corrugated packaging continued to be solid in this quarter with higher industry production of domestic and export containerboard in this quarter as compared to last year's March quarter. Industry box shipments in the March quarter were also higher than last year's March quarter by 3.4% on a per day basis as reported by the Fiber Box Association. The improved domestic and export containerboard volumes and box shipments resulted in healthy industry containerboard mill operating rates of 95.5% for the quarter. 
Demand for RockTenn's corrugated products was strong with export and domestic containerboard production improving more than the industry in the March quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. Export demand improved significantly, as our exports shipments of 206,000 tons in the quarter were up 19,000 tons or 7% from the prior year quarter, largely as a result of 3 factors. First, we added new customers. Second, we experienced improved demand in Latin America. And third, we added additional mill export volumes from our mill. Sequentially export containerboard volumes increased by 10,000 tons or about 4%. As compared to the December quarter of this fiscal year, export containerboard pricing was slightly lower by about $5 per ton as a result of changes in mix in the strengthening dollar. Our regional export mix was similar to last quarter, approximately 60% of our export shipments Latin America, 20% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia. RockTenn's box shipments also surpassed the industry's year-over-year improvement, starting in mid-September 2014, we began to see our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis. The increased box shipments were due to healthy industry box demand as well as the progress that we've been making in our product quality, service and improving the customer experience. Box demand continued to strengthen in the March quarter. Our growth exceeded industry box demand with our box shipments improving by 5.4% on a per day basis compared to last year's March quarter. There was no benefit from the mill acquisition on these strong box numbers as the Tacoma mill operated no box plants. 
RockTenn's corrugated segment mill operating rate for the quarter was 92.6%. If you exclude the 80,000 tons of maintenance downtime we took during the quarter, our operating rate was 96.5%. Our April box volumes are also very strong month-to-date as they are up 4% on a per day basis as compared to last year. Both April's have the same number of shipping days.
Containerboard and box trends are reflected in our financial results for the quarter. Corrugated Packaging segment sales are $1.73 billion, increased from $1.65 billion in the prior year March quarter, an increase of 5%. Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA margin for the March quarter was 17.3%, this is up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our focus on operational improvements continues to drive positive results. Corrugated productivity improved by 1% over the March quarter of 2014. The benefits of the  installation have driven flexo folder gluer performance to record levels. For the quarter flexo folder gluer performance increased 19% as compared to the prior-year quarter, and it was up 6% sequentially. productivity also set a record with 5% improvement over the March quarter of 2014. Additionally, our container plant labor efficiency as measured by square foot produced per labor hour increased by 3% over the last year. 
During the March quarter, we continued to execute our long-term EVOL flexo folder gluer strategy in our box plants. We added 1 machine at our New Jersey plant. Through the end of March, we have installed 12 of total 30 EVOLs that we plan to install in fiscal year '17. In April, we installed an EVOL in ou r Montgomery, Alabama plant, and we will install another one later in the quarter in our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant. These investments are greatly enhancing the capabilities and productivity of our box plant system. Our corrugated packaging team delivered excellent performance this quarter. I'm very pleased with our results that reflect both improving industry demand and the progress we're making on commercial and operational excellence initiatives.
During the March quarter, the CRB market strength in the SBS market remained in balance. CRB industry backlogs as of the week ending April 15, stood at 144,000 tons, 23% higher than last year's backlogs. RockTenn's CRB backlogs are about 3 weeks. SBS industry operating rates were at 95% within industry backlogs of approximately 4.5 weeks. RockTenn's most recent SBS backlogs are at about 8 weeks. RockTenn's SBS and pulp volumes were lower than the prior-year quarter as a result of the March major maintenance outage at  This was 1-month earlier than last year. Minor and major outages alternate every year. Industry folding carton volumes were down in the March quarter by 2.8% compared to the prior year quarter. As mentioned earlier, our folding carton volumes were up 1.1% for the same period driving our growth compared to the end industry. The RockTenn team performed extraordinarily well with net sales of $320 million, and this represents a record March quarter for the division. 
The promotional displays business has been impacted by the changing purchasing patterns of large retailers and consumer packaged goods companies looking to reduce their overall cost structure. Some large retailers are reducing the number of promotional displays in order to cut cost. Consumer packaged goods companies are actively evaluating their supply chain to reduce cost and in some cases that investing to reconfigure their distribution system. These changes had a direct impact on our results in the quarter. Merchandising display segment sales were flat as compared to the prior year quarter. The 2 acquisitions we made last year contributed $17 million in sales over the prior year quarter, and our sales of permanent displays increased by $3 million. Our sales of temporary display declined by $21 million from the prior year quarter.  
We have bad significant amounts of new contracted business, which have required investments in people and infrastructure, both to support the new business as well as future growth opportunities. Due to the changing market conditions and our previous investments to support the growth, we expect profitability in this segment to be about $25 million in fiscal year '15. In light of the change in customer demand or adjusting cost structure, and expect improved results in fiscal year '16. Merchandising display add significant value to our enterprise. Displays innovation and relationships helped both our container and folding carton businesses with new business opportunities. Displays purchases from our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging businesses also benefit RockTenn overall.
Lower recycle prices, soft demand in China and the West Coast labor disputes drive the negative year-over-year results in our recycling business. We believe the resolution for West Coast labor dispute and potential for stronger chance demand later in the year, will translate into stronger results. Our recycling business provide secure cost-effective access to recycled fiber. This provides a competitive advantage for our mill system and also provides market intelligence for our overall business. The recycling team does this very well. I'll turn it over to Ward, who will now discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?"

This quarter's selling price and mix were unfavorable to the March quarter of last year. This decline is primarily driven by the corrugated segment.  2/3 of this decline is related to the adverse impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on export containerboard pricing and box shipments into Canada and Mexico. The remainder of the decline is largely due to customer mix changes in corrugated box. Domestic box pricing was stable during the quarter. Export containerboard pricing declined by $35 per ton year-over-year, with most of the decline occurring last summer and fall when the currency impacts were quite rapid. Export markets have stabilized and volumes continue to be strong and export prices only declined by $5 per ton on a sequential basis. We experienced the favorable cost environment this quarter and had net cost deflation of approximately $45 million as compared to last year. Energy prices, driven by a 40% reduction in natural gas, generated a $40 million a benefit. Declines in fiber cost, primarily recycled fiber, contributed approximately $30 million benefit. These benefits were partially offset by higher wage benefits and other cost inflation. We generated $22 million in cost-savings and productivity improvements, this quarter over the prior year and have good momentum as we enter into our merger with MWV. Nonrecurring items in the quarter included the impact of the Panama City electrical outage, to labor disruptions and scheduled maintenance outage, which occurred in the June quarter last year. We continue to generate strong free cash flow at a level of $159 million or $1.11 per share during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have generated free cash flow of $845 million, or $5.86 per share. At the end of March, our net debt was approximately $2.75 billion. Our LTM credit agreement EBITDA was $1.6 billion and our leverage ratio was 1.74x. At March 31, we had used all the $5 million of our U.S. federal and foreign net operating losses. We still have approximately $56 million of various state net operating losses and other state credits available for use in future years. We also have significant remaining U.S. federal biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal tax credit that can be used to offset a total of $188 million of U.S. cash taxes. We expect to use these during fiscal years 2015 and 2016. 
The June quarter should be the last quarter we make any substantial pension contributions into our U.S. plans. Immediately after the merger, we will merge the overfunded MWV plants with the RockTenn plants. 
In terms of our CapEx guidance. We expect that the RockTenn 2015 capital expenditures will continue to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Maintenance downtime in the March quarter of 93,000 tons was slightly higher than last year's downtime of 73,000 tons. The majority of this maintenance downtime is in our corrugated segment. The June quarter is our heaviest maintenance outage quarter as we have planned to take maintenance downtime of a 116,000 tons at several of our key mills. At the end of March, our containerboard system inventory was 40,000 tons higher than one year ago. We have increased our inventory levels to better support our customers. Our inventory will peak in May at 10,000 tons higher than March and then showed a decline from there by 50,000 tons by the end of September. Now I will turn it back over to Steve who will discuss our outlook."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter and the strides we are making across our businesses and improving operating efficiency and offering customer-focused solutions. Our corrugated packaging business is performing very well. Box volumes are growing and box pricing continues to be stable. Domestic containerboard market conditions are solid and strengthening seasonally. Export market volumes continue to be strong and pricing is reasonable considering the currency situation. Our mills and box plants are operating well. Folding carton demand is also solid and we're strengthening in SBS and CRB markets and backlogs. 
Merger integration activity is going very well. We are on track to complete the merger in June. Our innovation teams are working to ensure we can hit the ground running on day 1, that we achieve and drive to exceed our synergy targets. As we work together, we continue to identify new opportunities. I plan to give a more detailed summary of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities as well as our roadmap to achieve them on our July earnings call. 
Our new company will have a great business platform, strong cash flows and a solid balance sheet. Our capital allocation will center around a leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x. On day 1, our leverage ratio should be at approximately 2x excluding the benefit of future synergies. Our leverage ratio is higher than both companies current levels, because we will be funding approximately $750 million at closing to repurchase the necessary RockTenn shares to reduce RockTenn's ownership interest of the new company to below 50%, and we will also use these funds for to pay the transaction cost. With the strength of our balance sheet and underlying cash flows, we will have a balanced capital allocation strategy that will allow us to pay an attractive dividend, continue to invest in our business, take advantage of a creative the business of facilities including acquisitions and return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. We considered postmerger dividend strategy, while that's the decision for the new board, I have some thoughts I will share with you now. With that many compositions with shareholders over the last 3 months, as always do, we listen. Our dividend policy should be that has a large cap component with strong cash flows, we should pay an attractive dividend when compared to large cap indices. When setting the dividend, we'll take into account the impact of plant spin, chemicals on our financial statements and also on our total market capitalization. I remain confident in the opportunities in front of us. This combination is a terrific opportunity to leverage the best of each company to create significant value for our customers and shareholders. As we expect to close on the merger this quarter, it's difficult to provide on guidance with respect to the reported results for the new company, that reported results would be a blend of both companies results during the quarter. If you're looking for helping in modeling, I would lead you to RockTenn's adjusted EPS for the June quarter on a stand-alone basis being about 20% higher than $0.85 we earned in the March quarter. Now with that, Jim, Mike, Ward and I are ready to take your questions."

During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with SEC. These include our most recent 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2014. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website. 
I'm going to start by discussing our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and various financial measures. I will complete our prepared remarks with comments on the status of the merger of MWV and the outlook. Then Ward, Jim, Mike and I will be available for your questions.
The RockTenn team continued to deliver solid operating results in the March quarter. Adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share were 35% higher than last year's adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share. This improvement was driven by strong results in our Corrugated Packaging segment, where segment income increased 28% over last year. This increase was a result of strong external demand in corrugated and solid commercial execution and operational improvement in our mills and box plant system. Additionally, we benefited from lower commodity cost. We were negatively affected by the combination of a substantial electrical failure at our Panama City mill and severe weather in February. These negative factors reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. We've seen our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis since the second half of September 2014. This trend continued during the December and March quarters for both RockTenn and the overall industry. RockTenn's March quarter box shipments increased 5.4% on an equivalent per day basis and actual shipments increased 3.7%, both of these are as compared to the prior year. There was 1 less shipping day in the quarter this year versus last year, and both numbers significantly exceeded the comparable industry numbers. We also saw very good end market demand in our folding carton business, where volumes were up 1.1% compared to the prior-year quarter. Performance in our Merchandising Displays business is not meeting our expectations. Segment income for the quarter was $12 million less than last quarter. I will speak to our Displays segment in more detail later in these prepared remarks. 
Our adjusted EPS of $0.85 is higher than the updated guidance range we provided at the end of March. While I like the fact that our performance exceeded these expectations, I would prefer that we not see this amount of difference between our actual and estimated results, particularly this late in the quarter. We regularly update our forecast each month and, in this circumstance, we faced a series of negative events during February and the first half of March. These negative events included weather impacts to our natural gas service at 4 of our large mills, where service was unexpectedly curtailed; the electrical issue at Panama City; and a discernible decline in demand for promotional displays. The cumulative impact of these events caused us to reduce our expectations, and with those facts, I felt compelled to update our guidance. While we were reducing our expectations, we benefited from a number of positive factors during the last week of March, including strong demand and operational performance in excess of our expectations across all of our businesses, particularly in our mills. The roughly $0.10 difference between our reported results from the top end of the revised guidance range to about 1/3 better mill and plant performance, 1/3 stronger sales and 1/3 forecast conservatism.
Net sales of $2.5 billion, were 3% higher than last year's March quarter. The Tacoma Mill acquisition, which was completed in May of last year, and the strong box plant performance contributed to the revenue increase. RockTenn's Credit Agreement EBITDA of $1.6 billion for the last 12 months was $66 million or 4% higher than last year's quarter. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.11 per share. We will absolutely maintain our focus on strong free cash flow generation after the merger is complete. We ended the March quarter with leverage of 1.74x, and our balance sheet is in great shape as we get closer to completing our merger with MWV.
Demand for Corrugated Packaging continued to be solid this quarter, with higher industry production of domestic and export containerboard in this quarter as compared to last year's March quarter. Industry box shipments in the March quarter were also higher than last year's March quarter by 3.4% on a per day basis as reported by the Fiber Box Association. The improved domestic and export containerboard volumes and box shipments resulted in healthy industry containerboard mill operating rates of 95.5% for the quarter. 
Demand for RockTenn's corrugated products was strong, with export and domestic containerboard production improving more than the industry in the March quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. Export demand improved significantly, as our exports shipments of 286,000 tons in the quarter were up 19,000 tons or 7% from the prior year quarter, largely as a result of 3 factors. First, we added new customers. Second, we experienced improved demand in Latin America. And third, we added additional mill export volumes from our Tacoma Mill. Sequentially, export containerboard volumes increased by 10,000 tons or about 4%. As compared to the December quarter of this fiscal year, export containerboard pricing was slightly lower by about $5 per ton as a result of changes in mix and the strengthening dollar. Our regional export mix was similar to last quarter, with approximately 60% of our export shipments to Latin America, 20% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia. RockTenn's box shipments also surpassed the industry's year-over-year improvement. Starting in mid-September 2014, we began to see our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis. The increased box shipments were due to healthy industry box demand as well as the progress that we've been making in our product quality, service and improving the customer experience. Box demand continued to strengthen in the March quarter. Our growth exceeded industry box demand, with our box shipments improving by 5.4% on a per day basis compared to last year's March quarter. There was no benefit from the Tacoma Mill acquisition on these strong box numbers, as the Tacoma Mill operated no box plants. 
RockTenn's Corrugated segment mill operating rate for the quarter was 92.6%. If we exclude the 80,000 tons of maintenance downtime we took during the quarter, our operating rate was 96.5%. Our April box volumes are also very strong month-to-date, as they are up over 4% on a per day basis as compared to last year. Both Aprils have the same number of shipping days.
Containerboard and box trends are reflected in our financial results for the quarter. Corrugated Packaging segment sales of $1.73 billion, increased from $1.65 billion in the prior year March quarter, an increase of 5%. Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA margin for the March quarter was 17.3%, this is up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our focus on operational improvements continues to drive positive results. Corrugated productivity improved by 1% over the March quarter of 2014. The benefits of the EVOL installations have driven flexo folder gluer performance to record levels. For the quarter, flexo folder gluer performance increased 19% as compared to the prior-year quarter and was up 6% sequentially. Die cutter productivity also set a record with 5% improvement over the March quarter of 2014. Additionally, our container plant labor efficiency, as measured by square feet produced per labor hour, increased by 3% over last year. 
During the March quarter, we continued to execute our long-term EVOL flexo folder gluer strategy in our box plants. We added 1 machine at our Dayton, New Jersey plant. Through the end of March, we have installed 12 of total 30 EVOLs that we plan to install in fiscal year '17. In April, we installed an EVOL in our Montgomery, Alabama plant, and we will install another one later in the quarter in our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant. These investments are greatly enhancing the capabilities and productivity of our box plant system. 
Our Corrugated Packaging team delivered excellent performance this quarter. I'm very pleased with our results that reflect both improving industry demand and the progress we're making on our commercial and operational excellence initiatives.
During the March quarter, the CRB market strength gained strength and the SBS market remained in balance. CRB industry backlogs, as of the week ending April 15, stood at 144,000 tons, 23% higher than last year's backlogs. RockTenn's CRB backlogs are at about 3 weeks. SBS industry operating rates were at 95%, with industry backlogs of approximately 4.5 weeks. RockTenn's most recent SBS backlogs are at about 8 weeks. RockTenn's SBS and pulp volumes were lower than the prior-year quarter as a result of the March major maintenance outage at Demopolis. This was 1 month earlier than last year. Minor and major outages alternate every year. 
Industry folding carton volumes were down in the March quarter by 2.8% compared to the prior year quarter. As mentioned earlier, our folding carton volumes were up 1.1% for the same period, driving our growth compared to the end industry. The RockTenn team performed extraordinarily well, with net sales of $320 million, and this represents a record March quarter for the division. 
The promotional displays business has been impacted by the changing purchasing patterns of large retailers and consumer packaged goods companies looking to reduce their overall cost structure. Some large retailers are reducing the number of promotional displays in order to cut costs. Consumer packaged goods companies are actively evaluating their supply chains to reduce cost and, in some cases, they're investing to reconfigure their distribution systems. These changes had a direct impact on our results in the quarter. Merchandising Displays segment sales were flat as compared to the prior year quarter. The 2 acquisitions we made last year contributed $17 million in sales over the prior year quarter, and our sales of permanent displays increased by $3 million. Our sales of temporary displays declined by $21 million from the prior year quarter.  
We have had significant amounts of new contracted business, which have required investments in people and infrastructure, both to support the new business as well as future growth opportunities. Due to the changing market conditions and our previous investments to support the growth, we expect profitability in this segment to be about $25 million in fiscal year '15. In light of the changing customer demand, we're adjusting our cost structure and expect improved results in fiscal year '16. Merchandising Displays adds significant value to our enterprise. Displays innovation and relationships helped both our container and folding carton businesses with new business opportunities. Displays purchases from our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging businesses also benefit RockTenn overall.
Lower recycled fiber prices, soft demand in China and the West Coast port labor disputes drove the negative year-over-year results in our recycling business. We believe the resolution of the West Coast labor dispute and the potential for stronger Chinese demand later in the year will translate into stronger results. 
Our Recycling business provides secure, cost-effective access to recycled fiber. This provides a competitive advantage for our mill system and also provides market intelligence for our overall business. The Recycling team does this very well. 
I'll turn it over to Ward, who will now discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?"

This quarter's selling price and mix were unfavorable to the March quarter of last year. This decline is primarily driven by the Corrugated segment. 2/3 of this decline is related to the adverse impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on export containerboard pricing and box shipments into Canada and Mexico. The remainder of the decline is largely due to customer mix changes in corrugated box. Domestic box pricing was stable during the quarter. Export containerboard pricing declined by $35 per ton year-over-year, with most of that decline occurring last summer and fall when the currency impacts were quite rapid. Export markets have stabilized and volumes continued to be strong and export prices only declined by $5 per ton on a sequential basis. We experienced a favorable cost environment this quarter and had net cost deflation of approximately $45 million as compared to last year. Energy prices, driven by a 40% reduction in natural gas, generated a $40 million benefit. Declines in fiber cost, primarily recycled fiber, contributed approximately $30 million benefit. These benefits were partially offset by higher wage, benefits and other cost inflation. We generated $22 million in cost-savings and productivity improvements this quarter over the prior year and have good momentum as we enter into our merger with MWV. Nonrecurring items in the quarter included the impact of the Panama City electrical outage, the La Tuque labor disruption and the Demopolis scheduled maintenance outage which occurred in the June quarter last year. 
We continued to generate strong free cash flow at a level of $159 million or $1.11 per share during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have generated free cash flow of $845 million or $5.86 per share. At the end of March, our net debt was approximately $2.75 billion. Our LTM Credit Agreement EBITDA was $1.6 billion and our leverage ratio was 1.74x. 
At March 31, we had used all but $5 million of our U.S. federal and foreign net operating losses. We still have approximately $56 million of various state net operating losses and other state credits available for use in future years. We also have significant remaining U.S. federal cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $188 million of U.S. cash taxes. We expect to use these during fiscal years 2015 and 2016. 
The June quarter should be the last quarter we make any substantial pension contributions into our U.S. plans. Immediately after the merger, we will merge the overfunded MWV plans with the RockTenn plans. 
In terms of our CapEx guidance. We expect that the RockTenn 2015 capital expenditures will continue to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Maintenance downtime in the March quarter of 93,000 tons was slightly higher than last year's downtime of 73,000 tons. The majority of this maintenance downtime is in our Corrugated segment. The June quarter is our heaviest maintenance outage quarter, as we plan to take maintenance downtime of 116,000 tons at several of our key mills. At the end of March, our containerboard system inventory was 40,000 tons higher than 1 year ago. We have increased our inventory levels to better support our customers. Our inventory will peak in May at 10,000 tons higher than March and then should decline from there by 50,000 tons by the end of September. 
Now I will turn it back over to Steve, who will discuss our outlook."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter and the strides we are making across our businesses in improving operating efficiency and offering customer-focused solutions. Our Corrugated Packaging business is performing very well. Box volumes are growing and box pricing continues to be stable. Domestic containerboard market conditions are solid, and strengthening seasonally. Export market volumes continue to be strong and pricing is reasonable, considering the currency situation. Our mills and box plants are operating well. Folding carton demand is also solid and we're seeing strengthening in SBS and CRB markets and backlogs. 
Merger integration activity is going very well. We're on track to complete the merger in June. Our integration teams are working to ensure we can hit the ground running on day 1, that we achieve and drive to exceed our synergy targets. As we work together, we continue to identify new opportunities. I plan to give a more detailed summary of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities as well as our road map to achieve them on our July earnings call. 
Our new company will have a great business platform, strong cash flows and a solid balance sheet. Our capital allocation will center around a normalized leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x. On day 1, our leverage ratio should be at approximately 2x, excluding the benefit of future synergies. Our leverage ratio is higher than both companies' current levels because we will be funding approximately $750 million at closing to repurchase the necessary RockTenn shares to reduce RockTenn's ownership interest of the new company to below 50%, and we will also use these funds for -- to pay deal-related transaction cost. With the strength of our balance sheet and underlying cash flows, we will have a balanced capital allocation strategy that will allow us to pay an attractive dividend; continue to invest in our business; take advantage of accretive business opportunity, including acquisitions; and return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
We've considered postmerger dividend strategy. While that's a decision for the new board, I have some thoughts I will share with you now. We've had many conversations with shareholders over the last 3 months. As we always do, we listen. Our dividend policy should reflect that as a large-cap company with strong cash flows, we should pay an attractive dividend when compared to large-cap indices. When setting the dividend, we'll take into account the impact of the planned spin of Specialty Chemicals on our financial statements and also on our total market capitalization. I remain confident in the opportunities in front of us. This combination is a terrific opportunity to leverage the best of each company to create significant value for our customers and shareholders. 
As we expect to close on the merger this quarter, it's difficult to provide on guidance with respect to the reported results for the new company. The reported results will be a blend of both companies' results during the quarter. If you're looking for help in your modeling, I would guide you to RockTenn's adjusted EPS for the June quarter on a stand-alone basis being about 20% higher than the $0.85 we earned in the March quarter. 
Now with that, Jim, Mike, Ward and I are now ready to take your questions."

I mean, it's -- our primary focus now is to merge the companies, get the organization working and get the most out of the existing organizations. So that's the job we're focused on now."

During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with SEC. These include our most recent 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2014. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website. 
I'm going to start by discussing our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and various financial measures. I will complete our prepared remarks with comments on the status of the merger of MWV and the outlook. Then Ward, Jim, Mike and I will be available for your questions.
The RockTenn team continued to deliver solid operating results in the March quarter. Adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share were 35% higher than last year's adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share. This improvement was driven by strong results in our Corrugated Packaging segment, where segment income increased 28% over last year. This increase was a result of strong external demand in corrugated and solid commercial execution and operational improvement in our mills and box plant system. Additionally, we benefited from lower commodity cost. We were negatively affected by the combination of a substantial electrical failure at our Panama City mill and severe weather in February. These negative factors reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. We've seen our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis since the second half of September of 2014. This trend continued during the December and March quarters for both RockTenn and the overall industry. RockTenn's March quarter box shipments increased 5.4% on an equivalent per day basis and actual shipments increased 3.7%, both of these are as compared to the prior year. There was 1 less shipping day in the quarter this year versus last year, and both numbers significantly exceeded the comparable industry numbers. We also saw very good end market demand in our folding carton business, where volumes were up 1.1% compared to the prior-year quarter. Performance in our Merchandising Displays business is not meeting our expectations. Segment income for the quarter was $12 million less than last quarter. I will speak to our Displays segment in more detail later in these prepared remarks. 
Our adjusted EPS of $0.85 is higher than the updated guidance range we provided at the end of March. While I like the fact that our performance exceeded these expectations, I would prefer that we not see this amount of difference between our actual and estimated results, particularly this late in the quarter. We regularly update our forecast each month and, in this circumstance, we faced a series of negative events during February and the first half of March. These negative events included weather impacts to our natural gas service at 4 of our large mills, where service was unexpectedly curtailed; the electrical issue at Panama City; and a discernible decline in demand for promotional displays. The cumulative impact of these events caused us to reduce our expectations, and with those facts, I felt compelled to update our guidance. While we were reducing our expectations, we benefited from a number of positive factors during the last week of March, including strong demand and operational performance in excess of our expectations across all of our businesses, particularly in our mills. The roughly $0.10 difference between our reported results in the top end of the revised guidance range to about 1/3 better mill and plant performance, 1/3 stronger sales and 1/3 forecast conservatism.
Net sales of $2.5 billion, were 3% higher than last year's March quarter. The Tacoma Mill acquisition, which was completed in May of last year, and the strong box plant performance contributed to the revenue increase. RockTenn's Credit Agreement EBITDA of $1.6 billion for the last 12 months was $66 million or 4% higher than last year's quarter. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.11 per share. We will absolutely maintain our focus on strong free cash flow generation after the merger is complete. We ended the March quarter with leverage of 1.74x, and our balance sheet is in great shape as we get closer to completing our merger with MWV.
Demand for Corrugated Packaging continued to be solid this quarter, with higher industry production of domestic and export containerboard in this quarter as compared to last year's March quarter. Industry box shipments in the March quarter were also higher than last year's March quarter by 3.4% on a per day basis as reported by the Fiber Box Association. The improved domestic and export containerboard volumes and box shipments resulted in healthy industry containerboard mill operating rates of 95.5% for the quarter. 
Demand for RockTenn's corrugated products was strong, with export and domestic containerboard production improving more than the industry in the March quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. Export demand improved significantly, as our exports shipments of 286,000 tons in the quarter were up 19,000 tons or 7% from the prior year quarter, largely as a result of 3 factors. First, we added new customers. Second, we experienced improved demand in Latin America. And third, we added additional mill export volumes from our Tacoma Mill. Sequentially, export containerboard volumes increased by 10,000 tons or about 4%. As compared to the December quarter of this fiscal year, export containerboard pricing was slightly lower by about $5 per ton as a result of changes in mix and the strengthening dollar. Our regional export mix was similar to last quarter, with approximately 60% of our export shipments to Latin America, 20% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia. RockTenn's box shipments also surpassed the industry's year-over-year improvement. Starting in mid-September 2014, we began to see our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis. The increased box shipments were due to healthy industry box demand as well as the progress that we've been making in our product quality, service and improving the customer experience. Box demand continued to strengthen in the March quarter. Our growth exceeded industry box demand, with our box shipments improving by 5.4% on a per day basis compared to last year's March quarter. There was no benefit from the Tacoma Mill acquisition on these strong box numbers, as the Tacoma Mill operated no box plants. 
RockTenn's Corrugated segment mill operating rate for the quarter was 92.6%. If we exclude the 80,000 tons of maintenance downtime we took during the quarter, our operating rate was 96.5%. Our April box volumes are also very strong month-to-date, as they are up over 4% on a per day basis as compared to last year. Both Aprils have the same number of shipping days.
Containerboard and box trends are reflected in our financial results for the quarter. Corrugated Packaging segment sales of $1.73 billion, increased from $1.65 billion in the prior year March quarter, an increase of 5%. Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA margin for the March quarter was 17.3%, this is up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our focus on operational improvements continues to drive positive results. Corrugated productivity improved by 1% over the March quarter of 2014. The benefits of the EVOL installations have driven flexo folder gluer performance to record levels. For the quarter, flexo folder gluer's performance increased 19% as compared to the prior-year quarter and was up 6% sequentially. Die cutter productivity also set a record with 5% improvement over the March quarter of 2014. Additionally, our container plant labor efficiency, as measured by square feet produced per labor hour, increased by 3% over last year. 
During the March quarter, we continued to execute our long-term EVOL flexo folder gluer strategy in our box plants. We added 1 machine at our Dayton, New Jersey plant. Through the end of March, we have installed 12 of total 30 EVOLs that we plan to install in fiscal year '17. In April, we installed an EVOL in our Montgomery, Alabama plant, and we will install another one later in the quarter in our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant. These investments are greatly enhancing the capabilities and productivity of our box plant system. 
Our Corrugated Packaging team delivered excellent performance this quarter. I'm very pleased with our results that reflect both improving industry demand and the progress we're making on our commercial and operational excellence initiatives.
During the March quarter, the CRB market gained strength and the SBS market remained in balance. CRB industry backlogs, as of the week ending April 15, stood at 144,000 tons, 23% higher than last year's backlogs. RockTenn's CRB backlogs are about 3 weeks. SBS industry operating rates were at 95%, with industry backlogs of approximately 4.5 weeks. RockTenn's most recent SBS backlogs are at about 8 weeks. RockTenn's SBS and pulp volumes were lower than the prior-year quarter as a result of the March major maintenance outage at Demopolis. This was 1 month earlier than last year. Minor and major outages alternate every year. 
Industry folding carton volumes were down in the March quarter by 2.8% compared to the prior year quarter. As mentioned earlier, our folding carton volumes were up 1.1% for the same period, driving our growth compared to the industry. The RockTenn team performed extraordinarily well, with net sales of $320 million. This represents a record March quarter for the division. 
The promotional displays business has been impacted by the changing purchasing patterns of large retailers and consumer packaged goods companies looking to reduce their overall cost structure. Some large retailers are reducing the number of promotional displays in order to cut costs. Consumer packaged goods companies are actively evaluating their supply chains to reduce cost and, in some cases, they're investing to reconfigure their distribution systems. These changes had a direct impact on our results in the quarter. Merchandising Displays segment sales were flat as compared to the prior year quarter. The 2 acquisitions we made last year contributed $17 million in sales over the prior year quarter, and our sales of permanent displays increased by $3 million. Our sales of temporary displays declined by $21 million from the prior year quarter.  
We have had significant amounts of new contracted business, which have required investments in people and infrastructure, both to support the new business as well as future growth opportunities. Due to the changing market conditions and our previous investments to support the growth, we expect profitability in this segment to be about $25 million in fiscal year '15. In light of the changing customer demand, we're adjusting our cost structure and expect improved results in fiscal year '16. Merchandising Displays adds significant value to our enterprise. Displays innovation and relationships helped both our container and folding carton businesses with new business opportunities. Displays purchases from our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging businesses also benefit RockTenn overall.
Lower recycled fiber prices, soft demand in China and the West Coast port labor disputes drove the negative year-over-year results in our recycling business. We believe the resolution of the West Coast labor disputes and the potential for stronger Chinese demand later in the year will translate into stronger results. 
Our Recycling business provides secure, cost-effective access to recycled fiber. This provides a competitive advantage for our mill system and also provides market intelligence for our overall business. The Recycling team does this very well. 
I'll turn it over to Ward, who will now discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?"

This quarter's selling price and mix were unfavorable to the March quarter of last year. This decline is primarily driven by the Corrugated segment. 2/3 of this decline is related to the adverse impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on export containerboard pricing and box shipments into Canada and Mexico. The remainder of the decline is largely due to customer mix changes in corrugated box. Domestic box pricing was stable during the quarter. Export containerboard pricing declined by $35 per ton year-over-year, with most of that decline occurring last summer and fall when the currency impacts were quite rapid. Export markets have stabilized and volumes continue to be strong and export prices only declined by $5 per ton on a sequential basis. We experienced a favorable cost environment this quarter and had net cost deflation of approximately $45 million as compared to last year. Energy prices, driven by a 40% reduction in natural gas, generated a $40 million benefit. Declines in fiber cost, primarily recycled fiber, contributed approximately $30 million benefit. These benefits were partially offset by higher wage, benefits and other cost inflation. We generated $22 million in cost-savings and productivity improvements this quarter over the prior year and have good momentum as we enter into our merger with MWV. Nonrecurring items in the quarter included the impact of the Panama City electrical outage, the La Tuque labor disruption and the Demopolis scheduled maintenance outage which occurred in the June quarter last year. 
We continued to generate strong free cash flow at a level of $159 million or $1.11 per share during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have generated free cash flow of $845 million or $5.86 per share. At the end of March, our net debt was approximately $2.75 billion. Our LTM Credit Agreement EBITDA was $1.6 billion and our leverage ratio was 1.74x. 
At March 31, we had used all but $5 million of our U.S. federal and foreign net operating losses. We still have approximately $56 million of various state net operating losses and other state credits available for use in future years. We also have significant remaining U.S. federal cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $188 million of U.S. cash taxes. We expect to use these during fiscal years 2015 and 2016. 
The June quarter should be the last quarter we make any substantial pension contributions into our U.S. plans. Immediately after the merger, we will merge the overfunded MWV plans with the RockTenn plans. 
In terms of our CapEx guidance. We expect that the RockTenn 2015 capital expenditures will continue to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Maintenance downtime in the March quarter of 93,000 tons was slightly higher than last year's downtime of 73,000 tons. The majority of this maintenance downtime is in our Corrugated segment. The June quarter is our heaviest maintenance outage quarter, as we plans to take maintenance downtime of 116,000 tons at several of our key mills. At the end of March, our containerboard system inventory was 40,000 tons higher than 1 year ago. We have increased our inventory levels to better support our customers. Our inventory will peak in May at 10,000 tons higher than March and then should decline from there by 50,000 tons by the end of September. 
Now I will turn it back over to Steve, who will discuss our outlook."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter and the strides we are making across our businesses in improving operating efficiency and offering customer-focused solutions. Our Corrugated Packaging business is performing very well. Box volumes are growing and box pricing continues to be stable. Domestic containerboard market conditions are solid, and strengthening seasonally. Export market volumes continue to be strong and pricing is reasonable, considering the currency situation. Our mills and box plants are operating well. Folding carton demand is also solid and we're seeing strengthening in SBS and CRB markets and backlogs. 
Merger integration activity is going very well. We're on track to complete the merger in June. Our integration teams are working to ensure we can hit the ground running on day 1, that we achieve and drive to exceed our synergy targets. As we work together, we continue to identify new opportunities. I plan to give a more detailed summary of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities as well as our road map to achieve them on our July earnings call. 
Our new company will have a great business platform, strong cash flows and a solid balance sheet. Our capital allocation will center around a normalized leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x. On day 1, our leverage ratio should be at approximately 2x, excluding the benefit of future synergies. Our leverage ratio is higher than both companies' current levels because we will be funding approximately $750 million at closing to repurchase the necessary RockTenn shares to reduce RockTenn's ownership interest of the new company to below 50%, and we will also use these funds for -- to pay deal-related transaction costs. With the strength of our balance sheet and underlying cash flows, we will have a balanced capital allocation strategy that will allow us to pay an attractive dividend; continue to invest in our business; take advantage of accretive business opportunities, including acquisitions; and return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
We've considered postmerger dividend strategy. While that's a decision for the new board, I have some thoughts I will share with you now. We've had many conversations with shareholders over the last 3 months. As we always do, we listen. Our dividend policy should reflect that as a large-cap company with strong cash flows, we should pay an attractive dividend when compared to large-cap indices. When setting the dividend, we'll take into account the impact of the planned spin of Specialty Chemicals on our financial statements and also on our total market capitalization. I remain confident in the opportunities in front of us. This combination is a terrific opportunity to leverage the best of each company to create significant value for our customers and shareholders. 
As we expect to close on the merger this quarter, it's difficult to provide our guidance with respect to the reported results for the new company. The reported results will be a blend of both companies' results during the quarter. If you're looking for help in your modeling, I would guide you to RockTenn's adjusted EPS for the June quarter on a stand-alone basis being about 20% higher than the $0.85 we earned in the March quarter. 
Now with that, Jim, Mike, Ward and I are now ready to take your questions."

And so I think we've got that business on a very important state, at present. And costs have come down. Wood recycle. Wood down year-over-year, wood down sequential quarter. We're generally very pleased with how our system's functioning. Our team has really improved the management of our inventories and put our supply chains in a much better stead so that we're not having to react to weather and various special cause situations. So we've got a much more stable and efficient wood process. Will it trend it up or down? We think we're in a really pretty stable position relative to wood. Recycled fiber, we've continued to have a period of declining fiber prices. There are some indications that we may have bottomed. And with the port situation cleaning up, we would expect Asian demand to increase and we're starting to see that a bit in the international markets.

I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new company. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our WestRock S-4 filing, most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, RockTenn and MeadWestvaco. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.
Since we announced the merger in January, we've been working on integrating the predecessor organizations into WestRock. We have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and Corrugated Packaging markets. And we've made substantial progress in structuring our organization externally with our customers and suppliers and internally across our 275 operating and business locations around the world. We've identified and organized ourselves to capture the synergies and performance improvements that we have available to us from the merger and also from the momentum both organizations had going into the merger. We're very excited about the strength of our new company and the opportunity to create real value for our customers, stockholders and employers. I feel good about the progress we're making to develop the WestRock culture.
Of course, our success depends on delivering strong results. With that in mind, I'm turning to what we've done in the most recent quarter. Because the merger closed on July 1, we're not recording consolidated WestRock results this quarter. We are reporting RockTenn's complete financial results for the June quarter. We're also reporting net sales and segment income information from the MeadWestvaco. We don't plan to report the complete financial results in MeadWestvaco for the June quarter, but I understand this maybe of interest to the investment community, which is not to maintain the administrative infrastructure and incur the expense necessary to report MeadWestvaco's completely financial results. The segment results show the detail regarding the current performance of our business, and we're providing details about the combined results of both companies in our new segment reporting structure.
We've accomplished a tremendous amount since announcing the merger 6 months ago, and I want to thank the WestRock team for maintaining our focus on serving our customers and operating very efficiently, while at the same time working diligently on integration. The financial results in the June quarter for each predecessor company bear this out. RockTenn's adjusted EPS of $1.15 increased by 17% over last year. MWV segment income increased by 7%. Our combined segment income was up 10%. I'm particularly pleased with the strong returns in the WestRock Corrugated Packaging business in North America and Brazil.
In our Consumer Packaging business folding carton Food & Beverage and Home Health & Beauty all performed well. For delivering on the envisioned benefits of our combination at the time announced the merger, we committed to a $300 million merger-related synergy target that represented approximately 7% of the revenue of the MWV packaging business. This was on top of the approximate $700 million in the ongoing contribution the programs we already had in place to improve productivity through process improvement and capital investment. Going forward, we'll track the total $1 billion synergy and performance improvement Corrugate. The overall goal is more readily identifiable on our financial statements and will avoid the non-value-added effort of determining whether an individual action is merger or performance related. We expect to reach the $1 billion target before the impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year 2018. This represents approximately 7% of our total revenue, excluding the Specialty Chemicals business. By the end of this September quarter, we expect to be at a run rate of $150 million in merger-related synergies and performance improvements.
An additional benefit of the merger is the ability to combine the overfunded MWV pension plans with the underfunded RockTenn plans. During the first week of July, we merged our U.S.-qualified pension plans and as a result, we will avoid over $550 million in future pension contributions, including $40 million that would have otherwise been contributed on July 15. Our confidence in achieving our future cash flows supports our stockholder return strategy that we announced on July 1 and is comprised of $1.50 per share dividend and a 40 million share repurchase authorization that we intend to use to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.50x. Our pro forma leverage closing was right at 2x.
WestRock will report our results in 4 business segments. Corrugated Packaging will generate approximately $2 billion in quarterly sales and will include the RockTenn North American Corrugated Packaging business and Recycling business. And MWV Brazilian and Indian Corrugated Packaging businesses. At $1.7 billion in quarterly sales, Consumer Packaging will include RockTenn's Consumer Packaging and Merchandising Displays business and MWV's Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty businesses. Specialty Chemicals and Land and Development will continue as separate segments.
Sales of our Corrugated Packaging business are approximately $8 billion per year with the production of 8.5 million tons of a wide variety of paperboards. Our 8 million tons of production in North America, our box plant system converts about 5 million tons per year and into Corrugated Packaging. The remaining 3 million tons are sold to independent corrugated converters in North America and other international markets. We've operated an integrated system in Brazil for over 60 years. In 2013, we completed the $500 million investment, including a new paper machine to grow our Corrugated Packaging business. About 2/3 of our approximate 500,000 tons of production is converted in our own box plants. these operations last month was a very impressed with the quality of the assets and the outstanding team we have in place there.
Turning to the results for the June quarter for our combined Corrugated Packaging segment. Industry demand for Corrugated Packaging in the United States increased by 1.3%, as measured by daily box shipments compared to last year. Exports grew by approximately 11% compared to last year. We exported 316,000 tons during the quarter, 30,000 tons more than both the March quarter and last year's quarter. Industry operating rates continue to be solid in the 96% range. We delivered very strong results in North America, as measured by our 200 basis point EBITDA margin improvement to 19.4%.
The performance of our box plant system was a highlight of the quarter. Our volumes increased by 3.9% compared to last year. In July, we've maintained this performance. Box volumes are up 4% over last year. We continue to benefit from the cumulative impact of many areas of improvement executed by our team over the past 4 years, including quality and customer service. We're now halfway through the installation of 30 EVOL flexo folder gluers, our results to date have exceeded our expectations.
Overall, corrugated box pricing in North America was up 0.6% as compared to the March quarter, and down 1.5% compared to last year. Pricing of domestic containerboard increased about 1% on a sequential basis, and also increased about 1% as compared to last year. Average export pricing declined by 1% from the March quarter and was down 8.5% compared to last year due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Pricing for containerboard for export to Latin America remains stable.
board continues to be tight, but we have taken some economic downtime in medium to match our supply with our demand. During the June quarter, we took 104,000 tons of maintenance downtime and less than 20,000 tons of economic downtime. We expect only 4,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter.
Our recycling operation improved profitability during the quarter, with segment income of $2.5 million after a loss in the March quarter of $400,000. This was a result of rising recycle prices and a strong operational cost focus. Consistent with recycling's primary mission of sourcing high-quality fiber for mills, in June, the recycling group started exporting 6,000 tons per month to our India mills. This has improved fiber quality and reduced our delivered cost.
Turning to Brazil. Economic conditions remain challenging. While industry demand declined by 2%, we delivered outstanding results with box volume growth of 15% year-over-year. EBITDA margins of 28.7% were very strong, up 530 basis points compared to last year. We're seeing gains with major national meat and produce customers as well as growth in food oils and chemical markets. We were successful in raising prices to offset cost inflation.
The new containerboard machine in Brazil continues to operate extremely well. June quarter shipments of 125,000 tons set a record and was 7% higher than 1 year ago. We are integrating the North American containerboard export business with our export business in Brazil to increase our efficiency and the value we can provide to international customers.
Sales in our Consumer Packaging business are approximately $7 billion per year. Mill production is approximately 4 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades.
All of our mill production is in North America. Our largest mill is Alabama, which produces over 1 million tons of coded natural kraft. Our SBS system produces 2.1 million tons from mills in Covington, Virginia, Demopolis, Alabama, Texas and La Tuque, Québec. We serve markets with high-quality requirements, including food and beverage, tobacco and commercial print markets. The recent acquisition of the Carolina-branded product line from International Paper improves our position in this attractive segment of the commercial print markets. Our recycled system includes 9 mills producing 1 million tons of coated and uncoated recycled paperboard.
Our folding carton system consists of 34 plants across North America and Europe and generate sales of about $2 billion. The WestRock Consumer Packaging business includes our Home, Health & Beauty dispensing business with approximately $600 million in sales. The combination of our dispensing business with our paper packaging businesses provides a unique, differentiated offering to these customers, and we are fully exploring these opportunities with our customers with very good success. Interestingly, the top 4 Home, Health & Beauty customers account for more than $150 million in sales, and these same customers purchase 500 million of corrugated boxes, folding cartons and displays from WestRock.
Packaging has a very significant impact on our customers' success in their markets. The breadth, depth and scale of WestRock's consumer and Corrugated Packaging solutions capabilities provides us with a unique opportunity to engage our customers to work together with us to help them be successful. Many of our customers are engaging with us on that very basis. I don't think any other company has the same opportunity, and I'm optimistic about what I've seen so far that I believe that we are and will be able to provide prospective products and services that will support our customers' success and provide a runway of growth for WestRock.
Turning to the results for the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall industry mill operating rates were stable with CRB showing the greatest strength. Industry backlogs for CRB are 33% higher than last year, and our backlogs of approximately 4 to 5 weeks. We recently informed our customers of a $50 per ton price increase for CRB effective next month.
Industry SBS backlog have weakened since last year, and our system backlogs are at approximately 3 to 4 weeks. After a good beverage season, demand for coated natural craft remains solid, and backlogs are roughly 4 to 5 weeks. The Food and Beverage business reported a 13% increase in income on flat sales and overcame currency headwinds that reduced sales by $22 million and income by $5 million. Beverage sales reflected volume growth and share gains in global beer that were offset by ongoing weakness in carbonated soft drink sales. All major regions, including North America, Europe and Asia contributed to our overall sales growth in beverage. Our food business in the quarter was mixed with ongoing weak demand in the U.S. retail food markets.
Despite this, we saw demand growth in food service, tobacco and selected retail food applications. During the quarter, we also began successfully on-boarding the Carolina business and will transition to full production from International Paper at the end of the calendar year.
For the RockTenn consumer packaging system, sales were flat with last year, while income increased by 11%. EBITDA margins improved by 140 basis points to 17.9%. Our converted volumes increased by 4% over the prior year as we captured new business, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities in our folding carton system.
Over the last 18 months, we've started up new process that are Knoxville, Tennessee, Kentucky and Quintin, Iowa plants.
Moving to our Merchandising Displays business. Industry demand for promotional displays are soft, driven by a number of factors, including the shift to the Clean Floor Policy of a major retailer. Merchandising Displays sales declined by 13% compared to last year. While income declined compared to last year, income more than doubled compared to the March quarter. We're working to match our cost structure to our anticipated levels of business through a number of actions, including streamlining our operations and have announced the closure of facilities in Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Lima, Ohio.
In the Home, Health & Beauty system income improved by 18% on lower sales, continuing the productivity improvement trends that we've seen for the past several quarters. Sales declined by 12% compared to the prior year, but decreased only 4% on a constant currency basis.
The negative currency translation impact was expected as more than 30% of these sales are from Western Europe. The business executed very well commercially and operationally. We continued to gain volume in value-added segments, including fragrance and trigger squares.
Specialty Chemicals is a $1 billion business with EBITDA margins of over 25%. About 75% of the business produces performance chemicals, including asphalt additives, oilfield chemicals and a variety of other products. The performance chemical business adapts its refining process to changing market demand. As an example, when demand for oilfield chemicals had declined, we've been able to produce other products, including our asphalt additive products to mitigate the impact of this change in market demand. The activated carbon business accounts for 25% of the segment revenue as a very strong position and global automotive markets.
The business has grown and sustained attractive profitability based on its consistent ability to identify opportunities and bring value-added solutions to market. We've been investing to expand capacity in Specialty Chemicals. Capital expenditures have been $100 million over the past 12 months, which includes our estimate of ongoing maintenance capital needs of $35 million per year. The most significant growth project has been in China, where we've invested in a greenfield activated carbon plant that will increase our capacity to serve the global automotive market by 15%. This plant will help us maintain our leadership in activated carbon, which is expected to grow with new more stringent global automotive emission requirements being phased in over the next several years.
As much as we like the Specialty Chemicals business, it's not core to WestRock, and we continue to work toward spinning this business off into a new company called Longevity. We're well into our CEO search and expect to make an announcement in August. We intend to file the initial Form 10 in September. While we anticipate that we will be prepared to initiate the spin at the end of December, we are following guidance from our advisers for the best timing from an equity capital markets perspective, will be the launch spin-off to stockholders during the March quarter of 2016.
For the June quarter, Specialty Chemicals revenue declined 8%, but was down 4% on a currency adjusted basis. Currency headwinds impacted the top line by $11 million. The business had a record sales of asphalt additives and activated carbon in the quarter, partially offsetting weakness in oilfield chemicals and other markets. Our patented were mix paving solution EVOL, had strong performance in the U.S. and Europe. Awareness of the performance and sustainability benefits of EVOL continue to grow.
The activated carbon business remains strong, with a growing portion of sales coming from higher-value solutions that address the more stringent automotive emission standards mandated by U.S. regulatory agencies that phase in beginning in 2017.
Segment EBITDA margins were 26.7%. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA margins were 27.9%. The business continues to perform exceptionally well.
WestRock Land and Development is our legacy land development business, which after entitling approximately 100,000 acres for development, selling over 1 million acres of timber and recreational land for over $2 billion over the last 8 years, is now focused on the value-added monetization of the remaining approximately 80,000 acres of development land, primarily located in and around Charleston, South Carolina. Most of the projects are held in partnerships with Plum Creek Land Company and others and are managed by WestRock.
Growth trends in the Charleston, South Carolina market are very positive. The Port of Charleston is growing. Boeing continues to expand at 787 manufacturing facility. Downward Bones is building a new $500 million sprinter van manufacturing facility, which will employ 1,300 people, and Volvo recently announced the construction of a $500 million manufacturing facility that will employ 2,000 people.
Last Friday, WestRock sold a 6,600-acre [ph] track for $34 million for Volvo's new manufacturing facility. It's nearby commercial and industrial land holdings and communities including and summer's corner are well positioned to benefit from the ongoing regional growth around Charleston.
We expect these very favorable dynamics to support the acceleration of development land sales over the coming quarters. We're continuing to pursue the disciplined development of infrastructure and facilities necessary to match the increased demand for land from users, developers and homebuilders at a pace that maximizes value for stockholders.
WestRock will generate significant cash flow that will be available to be reinvested in the business or returned to stockholders. We have and will focus on a capital allocations critical to our success, and we expect to have attractive opportunities to invest in our business. We've invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures in our business during the past 2 years, including $865 million during the past 12 months. These investments include the new paper machine in Brazil, a new biomass boiler at our Covington, Virginia mill, a new woodyard in Florence, South Carolina, 15 new EVOL flexo folder gluers and our box plant system, the new activated carbon plant in China. WestRock stockholders are the beneficiaries of these investments.
We've recently completed our capital budget for fiscal year 2016. The capital budget process has included identifying projects proving multiple lenses of: the market, our business strategy, the situation individual locations. We've prioritized these projects by business and location in light of the aggregate fit with our business strategy. We plan to invest approximately $850 million in capital during fiscal 2016. We estimate maintenance capital to be $500 million. For the $350 million in return-generating projects, we expect to return unlevered after-tax returns in the range of 20%.
The key return-generating capital projects in the paper solutions business are the Demopolis biomass boiler, the rebuild of the bark boiler at Mark, the carbonate project at the Stevenson, Alabama mill and the evaporator upgrade at the West Point, Virginia mill. Key return-generating projects within the packaging solutions group include: The installation of 7 additional EVOL flexo folder gluers in our box plants and 3 additional process at our folding carton plants, along with the conversion of our plant in the Czech Republic from tobacco to beverage operations. We'll make other investments in beverage and Home, Health & Beauty to respond to specific customer requirements. Of $850 million, about $35 million is the Specialty Chemicals in the December quarter prior to spin-off.
After investing the capital necessary to support and improve our business, WestRock will be able to return significant capital to stockholders. During the past 12 months, the combined companies paid $310 million in dividends and bought $265 million of stock. We would have bought back more stock had we not been prevented from doing so as a result of the merger. We've increased the annual dividend rate to $1.50 per share or $400 million, and we're in a position to buy back up to 40 million shares of stock to move to and maintain our target leverage ratio that's in the range of 2.25 to 2.50x.
I like the management team of the combined company. This group has come extremely well, and we're working together effectively to move our company forward. As many of you know, our corporate management team, including me, our Chief Financial, Accounting, Human Resource and Sustainability officers as well as our General Counsel, are all located in Norcross. Our Chief Communications and Chief Strategy Officers will be relocating to Norcross. We will continue to have a very significant presence in Richmond, which will be the location of our consumer paperboard, beverage and Home, Health & Beauty businesses as well as the center of our research and development functions for the entire company. And WestRock University, the center of our talent development activities.
The work that we've done on integrating the businesses, the work we've done on the dividend, share repurchases and the capital budget, the work we've done to put our organization in place, combined with the strong results we posted for the June quarter, provide us with a firm foundation and momentum as we enter the first year of WestRock.
I'll now turn the call over to Ward, and I'll come back after Ward's comments and wrap up the call. Ward?"

We had strong growth in segment income with an increase of $32 million. The combination of price and mix was a negative $34 million, related primarily to the decline in export containerboard and pulp pricing over the last year. There has been some price and mix decline in box pricing over the last year, but only at approximately 1.5%. Cost deflation continued to be a benefit during the quarter with reductions in both recycled fiber and virgin fiber. Recycled fiber prices were down approximately 23% from last year. Our overall virgin fiber costs were down 3.8% from last year from a combination of lower prices, capital investments and the implementation over the last 2 years of our new wood-buying strategy.
We continue to make strong productivity gains, generating $31 million in benefit in the quarter, with good momentum as we move to the $1 billion target for combined merger-related synergy and performance improvements. DNA, a noncash item, was $9 million unfavorable. Last year, we recognized a $9 million gain, recording previously unreported spare parts inventories.
MWV segment income improved by $14 million over last year despite the effects of currency. Cost deflation was a $12 million benefit with gains in energy, fiber and chemicals. Ongoing productivity and margin improvement programs created $21 million in higher earnings and provided good platform for our current initiatives. Pension income was $13 million lower on a quarterly basis.
Immediately after the merger announcement, we started on the integration, analysis and preparation and developed detailed plans for every synergy opportunity. We engaged outside advisers to help us in certain areas. The $1 billion target includes both companies specific cost reduction and performance improvement targets of approximately $700 million and the merger-related synergies target of $300 million. Over 1/2 of the $1 billion target will come from our ongoing productivity and performance improvement programs across our manufacturing footprint and cost savings from capital investments. Almost 30% will be from procurement opportunities, and the remainder will be from manufacturing optimization and reductions from the elimination of duplicate corporate cost and support functions. The $1 billion performance improvement savings will be realized at about 1/3 over each of the next 3 years. We expect to realize a run rate of $150 million in savings by the end of September. The elimination of duplicate corporate expenses will be realized quickly. We have developed concrete plans behind each of these areas and have pushed the savings goals down to each business and function. Everyone will be held accountable for realizing these targets.
Total transaction-related costs were approximately $115 million, and the estimated cost for us to capture the merger-related synergies are approximately $100 million. We estimate 20% to 30% of this will be paid from pension plan assets.
I want to highlight that the $1 billion is before inflation. Labor benefits and insurance expense accounts for approximately $3.5 billion per year, and normal inflation on this category should be approximately $100 million per year. The balance of our inflation will depend on commodity price trends and could add another $125 million to $175 million in inflation per year. We will update the investment community on our progress against our target as part of our quarterly results. We bring a disciplined cost focus to the business and are instilling that view across 42,000 employees. We are currently rolling out allocations of the applicable corporate overhead cost to each business and call center, and we know from our past that it drives full accountability and visibility across the organization. By fully allocating costs, the businesses are able to challenge the corporate departments on their cost and spending, and management can determine where the best returns in investments should be made, if at all.
Our post-merger balance sheet is very strong as opening leverage is approximately 2x and our maturities are very well spaced out. Both S&P and Moody's reaffirmed their ratings on WestRock at investment grade. Our $4.9 billion bank financing package has attractive terms and combined with our other facilities, provides us with more than $3.5 billion of current available liquidity to execute on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. With leverage at 2x and our stock price at these levels, we have an opportunity to move rather quickly to increase our leverage toward our 2.25x to 2.5x leverage target. Our current debt mix is 62% fixed and 38% floating. Our combined average interest rate is about 4.7%. Our marginal cost to borrow on our available lines is less than 1.35%.
Before turning back to Steve, let me provide you an overview of some of the key assumptions that will help you in our modeling of our September quarter. Although our purchase price accounting work is not yet finalized, $270 million is our current estimate of depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter. Of that, approximately $70 million is quarterly intangible amortization expense or $280 million on an annual basis. This will flow through our SG&A line and should be considered when making comparisons of our SG&A expense versus peers.
We will do everything we can to drive unnecessary costs out of our business. For example, we are actively working to sublease the entire New York Park Avenue office space, and we'll seek to sublease currently available space enrichment. We're evaluating other opportunities to sublease available space across our company.
Effective with our July 2 pension plan margin, we are approximately 109% funded on a GAAP basis in our U.S. plans and are embarking on a de-risking liability-driven pension investment strategy that is approximately 80% bonds. The corresponding expected return on the asset portfolio is 5.87%, which is reducing our forecasted pension income to about $8 million for the quarter. By moving immediately on merging the pension plans, we saved $14 million in pension contributions that would have been due on July 15.
We have provided a cost of goods sold breakout, which outlines our cost pools across our entire manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have provided 80 [ph] annual commodity consumption volumes to help you. The current estimated annual dollars spend across these 8 categories is approximately $2.8 billion. As we think about our foreign -- our exposure to foreign currencies, we look at our geographic revenue mix overall, which is 79% North American and 21% outside of this region. Of this 21%, approximately half is comprised of exports, of containerboard and paperboard that are priced primarily in U.S. dollars. The remainder is sold in local currency. Our largest foreign currency exposures are related to the euro and the Brazilian real. We estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against these currencies would have a $30 million negative impact to EBT on an annual basis.
Back to you, Steve."

This includes overall containerboard, paperboard and packaging markets, while materials prices are also relatively stable. With respect to the outlook for the September quarter, we expect that the performance trends we have seen over the past quarter will continue and that our success in the quarter will be influenced by how we perform and maintain our momentum, including capturing opportunities available to us as a result of the merger.
When we announced the merger on January 26, we said that together, we're creating a global industry leader in consumer and Corrugated Packaging, a company with true competitive advantages, including an outstanding organization, a market-focused customer-centric strategy and scale. We said that we'd be leveraging the strengths of both companies into a larger, more balanced and more global business, that the combined company would have an enhanced presence in the marketplace that will provide substantial opportunities for profitable growth. We said that we'd have the financial strength and flexibility to enable this growth.
All that remains true 6 months later. In fact, after 6 months, I feel even better about this combination, WestRock, than I did in January. We have a strong foundation and a near-term road map to capture the $1 billion in merger-related synergy and performance improvement opportunities by the end of fiscal 2018, and we're very focused on cash flow generation overall. Corrugated and Consumer Packaging are attractive businesses where scale and differentiation matter. We offer a set of products and services and scale that can't be offered by any other company. This provides us the opportunity to grow. We have the cash flow available to invest for growth on a disciplined basis and also the ability to return significant cash to stockholders via dividends and share repurchases. I want to thank you for your time and interest.

Inventories are something that we micromanage, if you will, to ensure that we can provide adequate supply to our internal packaging operations as well as our customers. And we've just completed a large downtime quarter in the last quarter, and so our inventories dropped as did the industry inventories dropped. As we reflect on inventories, in general, I know there's a lot perhaps on the comps for current industry inventories relative to the average 10-year inventories. And we just think that's really not apples-to-apples today. Examples being that we acquired the Smurfit-Stone assets in 2011, and they just had a very unsustainably low level of inventory that was not capable of providing our internal packaging operations. The ability to perform with appropriate on-time delivery and supply chain costs that were sustainable. And so we, today, focus our inventories on what is the optimal safety stock of doing supply chain math to try to manage that very crystally. And so we think inventories are at a sustainable level that is something that we will flex with changes in our mill operating uptime and the conditions in the market relative to rail and truck availability, et cetera."

This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new company.

I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new company. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our WestRock S-4 filing and most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, RockTenn and MeadWestvaco. 
We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.
Since we announced the merger in January, we've been working on integrating the predecessor organizations into WestRock. We have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets, and we've made substantial progress in structuring our organization, externally, with our customers and suppliers and, internally, across our 275 operating and business locations around the world. We've identified and organized ourselves to capture the synergies and performance improvements that we have available to us from the merger and also from the momentum both organizations had going into the merger. We're very excited about the strength of our new company and the opportunity to create real value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I feel good about the progress we're making to develop the WestRock culture.
Of course, our success depends on delivering strong results. With that in mind, I'm turning to what we've done in the most recent quarter. Because the merger closed on July 1, we're not reporting consolidated WestRock results this quarter. We are reporting RockTenn's complete financial results for the June quarter. We're also reporting net sales and segment income information from MeadWestvaco. We don't plan to report the complete financial results of MeadWestvaco for the June quarter. I understand this may be of interest to the investment community. We chose not to maintain the administrative infrastructure and incur the expense necessary to report MeadWestvaco's complete financial results. The segment results show the detail regarding the current performance of our business, and we're providing details about the combined results of both companies in our new segment reporting structure.
We've accomplished a tremendous amount since announcing the merger 6 months ago, and I want to thank the WestRock team for maintaining our focus on serving our customers and operating very efficiently while, at the same time, working diligently on integration. The financial results in the June quarter for each predecessor company bear this out. RockTenn's adjusted EPS of $1.15 increased by 17% over last year. MWV segment income increased by 7%. Our combined segment income was up 10%. I'm particularly pleased with the strong returns in the WestRock Corrugated Packaging business in North America and Brazil. In our Consumer Packaging business, folding carton, food & beverage and home, health & beauty all performed well. 
For delivering on the envisioned benefits of our combination, at the time we announced the merger, we committed to a $300 million merger-related synergy target that represented approximately 7% of the revenue of MWV packaging business. This was on top of the approximate $700 million and the ongoing contribution the programs we already had in place to improve productivity through process improvement and capital investment. Going forward, we'll track the total $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target. 
The overall goal is more readily identifiable on our financial statements and will avoid the non-value-added effort of determining whether an individual action is merger or performance-related. We expect to reach the $1 billion target before the impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year 2018. This represents approximately 7% of our total revenue, excluding the Specialty Chemicals business. By the end of this September quarter, we expect to be at a run rate of $150 million in merger-related synergies and performance improvements.
An additional benefit of the merger is the ability to combine the overfunded MWV pension plans with the underfunded RockTenn plans. During the first week of July, we merged our U.S.-qualified pension plans. And as a result, we will avoid over $550 million in future pension contributions, including $40 million that would've otherwise been contributed on July 15. 
Our confidence in achieving our future cash flows supports our stockholder return strategy that we announced on July 1 and is comprised of $1.50 per share dividend and a 40 million share repurchase authorization that we intend to use to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.50x. Our pro forma leverage at closing was right at 2x.
WestRock will report our results in 4 business segments. Corrugated Packaging will generate approximately $2 billion in quarterly sales and will include the RockTenn North American corrugated packaging business and recycling business and MWV Brazilian and Indian corrugated packaging businesses. At $1.7 billion in quarterly sales, Consumer Packaging will include RockTenn's consumer packaging and merchandising displays business and MWV's food & beverage and home, health & beauty businesses. Specialty Chemicals and Land and Development will continue as separate segments.
Sales of our Corrugated Packaging business are approximately $8 billion per year with the production of 8.5 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades. Of our 8 million tons of production in North America, our box plant system converts about 5 million tons per year into corrugated packaging. The remaining 3 million tons are sold to independent corrugated converters in North America and other international markets. 
We've operated an integrated system in Brazil for over 60 years. In 2013, we completed the $500 million investment, including a new paper machine to grow our Corrugated Packaging business. About 2/3 of our approximate 500,000 tons of production is converted in our own box plants. I visited these operations last month. I was very impressed with the quality of the assets and the outstanding team we have in place there.
Turning to the results for the June quarter for our combined Corrugated Packaging segment. Industry demand for corrugated packaging in the United States increased by 1.3% as measured by daily box shipments compared to last year. Exports grew by approximately 11% compared to last year. We exported 316,000 tons during the quarter, 30,000 tons more than both the March quarter and last year's quarter. Industry operating rates continue to be solid in the 96% range. We delivered very strong results in North America as measured by our 200 basis point EBITDA margin improvement to 19.4%.
The performance of our box plant system was a highlight of the quarter. Our volumes increased by 3.9% compared to last year. In July, we've maintained this performance. Box volumes are up 4% over last year. We continue to benefit from the cumulative impact of many areas of improvement executed by our team over the past 4 years, including quality and customer service. We're now halfway through the installation of 30 EVOL flexo folder gluers. Our results to date have exceeded our expectations.
Overall, corrugated box pricing in North America was up 0.6% as compared to the March quarter and down 1.5% compared to last year. Pricing of domestic containerboard increased about 1% on a sequential basis and also increased about 1% as compared to last year. Average export pricing declined by 1% from the March quarter and was down 8.5% compared to last year due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Pricing for containerboard for export to Latin America remains stable.
Linerboard continues to be tight, but we've -- we have taken some economic downtime in medium to match our supply with our demand. During the June quarter, we took 104,000 tons of maintenance downtime and less than 20,000 tons of economic downtime. We expect only 4,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter.
Our recycling operation improved profitability during the quarter with segment income of $2.5 million after a loss in the March quarter of $400,000. This was a result of rising recycle prices and a strong operational cost focus. Consistent with recycling's primary mission of sourcing high-quality fiber for our mills, in June, the recycling group started exporting 6,000 tons per month to our India mills. This has improved fiber quality and reduced our delivered costs.
Turning to Brazil. Economic conditions remain challenging. While industry demand declined by 2%, we delivered outstanding results with box volume growth of 15% year-over-year. EBITDA margins of 28.7% were very strong, up 530 basis points compared to last year. We're seeing gains with major national meat and produce customers as well as growth in food oils and chemical markets. We were successful in raising prices to offset cost inflation.
The new containerboard machine in Brazil continues to operate extremely well. June quarter shipments of 125,000 tons set a record and were 7% higher than 1 year ago. We are integrating the North American containerboard export business with our export business in Brazil to increase our efficiency and the value we can provide to international customers.
Sales in our Consumer Packaging business are approximately $7 billion per year. Mill production is approximately 4 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades. All of our mill production is in North America. Our largest mill is Mahrt Alabama, which produces over 1 million tons of coated natural kraft. Our SBS system produces 2.1 million tons from mills in: Covington, Virginia; Demopolis, Alabama; Evadale, Texas; and La Tuque, Québec. We serve markets with high-quality requirements, including food and beverage, tobacco and commercial print markets. The recent acquisition of the Carolina-branded product line from International Paper improves our position in this attractive segment of the commercial print markets. Our recycled system includes 9 mills producing 1 million tons of coated and uncoated recycled paperboard. Our folding carton system consists of 34 plants across North America and Europe and generate sales of about $2 billion. 
The WestRock Consumer Packaging business includes our home, health & beauty dispensing business with approximately $600 million in sales. The combination of our dispensing business with our paper packaging businesses provides a unique, differentiated offering to these customers, and we're fully exploring these opportunities with our customers with very good success. Interestingly, the top 4 home, health & beauty customers account for more than $150 million in sales, and these same customers purchase 500 million of corrugated boxes, folding cartons and displays from WestRock.
Packaging has a very significant impact on our customer's success in their markets. The breadth, depth and scale of WestRock's Consumer and Corrugated Packaging solutions capabilities provides us with a unique opportunity to engage our customers to work together with us to help them be successful. Many of our customers are engaging with us on that very basis. I don't think any other company has the same opportunity, and I'm optimistic about what I've seen so far that I believe that we are and will be able to provide perspective, products and services that will support our customers' success and provide a runway of growth for WestRock.
Turning to the results for the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall industry mill operating rates are stable with CRB showing the greatest strength. Industry backlogs for CRB are 33% higher than last year, and our backlogs are approximately 4 to 5 weeks. We recently informed our customers of a $50 per ton price increase for CRB effective next month. Industry SBS backlogs have weakened since last year, and our system backlogs are at approximately 3 to 4 weeks. After a good beverage season, demand for coated natural kraft remains solid, and backlogs are roughly 4 to 5 weeks. 
The food and beverage business reported a 13% increase in income on flat sales and overcame currency headwinds that reduced sales by $22 million and income by $5 million. Beverage sales reflected volume growth and share gains in global beer that were offset by on-growing -- ongoing weakness in carbonated soft drink sales. All major regions, including North America, Europe and Asia, contributed to our overall sales growth in beverage. Our food business in the quarter was mixed with ongoing weak demand in the U.S. retail food markets. Despite this, we saw demand growth in food service, tobacco and selected retail food applications. During the quarter, we also began successfully onboarding the Carolina business and will transition to full production from International Paper at the end of the calendar year.
For the RockTenn consumer packaging system, sales were flat with last year while income increased by 11%. EBITDA margins improved by 140 basis points to 17.9%. Our converted volumes increased by 4% over the prior year as we captured new business, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities in our folding carton system. Over the last 18 months, we've started up new process on our: Knoxville, Tennessee; Nicholasville, Kentucky; and Clinton, Iowa plants.
Moving to our merchandising displays business. Industry demand for promotional displays are soft, driven by a number of factors, including the shift to the clean floor policy of a major retailer. Merchandising displays sales declined by 13% compared to last year. While income declined compared to last year, income more than doubled compared to the March quarter. We're working to match our cost structure to our anticipated levels of business through a number of actions, including streamlining our operations and have announced the closure of facilities in: Tullahoma, Tennessee; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Lima, Ohio.
In the home, health & beauty system, income improved by 18% on lower sales, continuing the productivity improvement trends that we've seen for the past several quarters. Sales declined by 12% compared to the prior year, but decreased only 4% on a constant currency basis. The negative currency translation impact was expected as more than 30% of these sales are from Western Europe. The business executed very well commercially and operationally. We continue to gain volume in value-added segments, including fragrance and trigger sprayers.
Specialty Chemicals is a $1 billion business with EBITDA margins of over 25%. About 75% of the business produces performance chemicals, including asphalt additives, oilfield chemicals and a variety of other products. The performance chemical business adapts its refining process to changing market demand. As an example, when demand for oilfield chemicals has declined, we've been able to produce other products, including our asphalt additive products, to mitigate the impact of this change in market demand. The activated carbon business accounts for 25% of the segment revenue, has a very strong position in global automative -- automotive markets. The business has grown and sustained attractive profitability based on its consistent ability to identify opportunities and bring value-added solutions to market. 
We've been investing to expand capacity in Specialty Chemicals. Capital expenditures have been $100 million over the past 12 months, which includes our estimate of ongoing maintenance capital needs of $35 million per year. The most significant growth project has been in China, where we've invested in a greenfield activated carbon plant that will increase our capacity to serve the global automotive market by 15%. This plant will help us maintain our leadership in activated carbon, which is expected to grow with new more stringent global automotive emission requirements being phased in over the next several years.
As much as we like the Specialty Chemicals business, it's not core to WestRock, and we continue to work towards spinning this business off into a new company called Ingevity. We're well into our CEO search and expect to make an announcement in August. We intend to file the initial Form 10 in September. While we anticipate that we will be prepared to initiate the spin at the end of December, we're following guidance from our advisers that the best timing, from an equity capital markets perspective, will be to launch the spin-off to stockholders during the March quarter of 2016.
For the June quarter, Specialty Chemicals revenue declined 8%, but was down 4% on a currency-adjusted basis. Currency headwinds impacted the top line by $11 million. The business had record sales of asphalt additives and activated carbon in the quarter, partially offsetting weakness in oilfield chemicals and other markets. Our patented warm mix paving solution, Evotherm, had strong performance in the U.S. and Europe. Awareness of the performance and sustainability benefits of Evotherm continue to grow.
The activated carbon business remains strong with a growing portion of sales coming from higher-value solutions that address the more stringent automotive emission standards mandated by U.S. regulatory agencies that phase in beginning in 2017. Segment EBITDA margins were 26.7%. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA margins were 27.9%. The business continues to perform exceptionally well.
WestRock Land and Development is our legacy land development business, which, after entitling approximately 100,000 acres for development, selling over 1 million acres of timber and recreational land for over $2 billion over the last 8 years, is now focused on the value-added monetization of the remaining approximately 80,000 acres of development land, primarily located in and around Charleston, South Carolina. Most of the projects are held in partnerships with Plum Creek Land Company and others and are managed by WestRock.
Growth trends in the Charleston, South Carolina market are very positive. The Port of Charleston's growing. Boeing continues to expand its 787 manufacturing facility. Daimler Vans is building a new $500 million sprinter van manufacturing facility, which will employ 1,300 people, and Volvo recently announced the construction of a $500 million manufacturing facility that will employ 2,000 people. Last Friday, WestRock sold a 6,600-acre track for $34 million for Volvo's new manufacturing facility. It's nearby commercial and industrial land holdings and master-planned communities, including Nexton and Summers Corner, are well positioned to benefit from the on-growing -- ongoing regional growth around Charleston.
We expect these very favorable dynamics to support the acceleration of development land sales over the coming quarters. We're continuing to pursue the disciplined development of infrastructure and facilities necessary to match the increased demand for land from users, developers and homebuilders at a pace that maximizes value for stockholders.
WestRock will generate significant cash flow that will be available to be reinvested in the business or returned to stockholders. We have and will focus on capital allocations critical to our success, and we expect to have attractive opportunities to invest in our business. We've invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures in our business during the past 2 years, including $865 million during the past 12 months. These investments include the new paper machine in Brazil, a new biomass boiler at our Covington, Virginia mill, a new woodyard in Florence, South Carolina, 15 new EVOL flexo folder gluers in our box plant system, the new activated carbon plant in China. WestRock stockholders are the beneficiaries of these investments.
We've recently completed our capital budget for fiscal year 2016. The capital budget process has included identifying projects including multiple lenses of: the market, our business strategy, the situation in individual locations. We've prioritized these projects by business and location in light of the aggregate fit with our business strategy. We plan to invest approximately $850 million in capital during fiscal 2016. We estimate maintenance capital to be $500 million. For the $350 million in return-generating projects, we expect to return unlevered after tax returns in the range of 20%.
The key return-generating capital projects in the paper solutions business are the Demopolis biomass boiler, the rebuild of the bark boiler at Mahrt, the carbonate cook project at the Stevenson, Alabama mill and the evaporator upgrade at the West Point, Virginia mill. Key return-generating projects within the packaging solutions group include: the installation of 7 additional EVOL flexo folder gluers in our box plants and 3 additional process at our folding carton plants, along with the conversion of our plant in the Czech Republic from tobacco to beverage operations. We'll make other investments in beverage and home, health & beauty to respond to specific customer requirements. Of the $850 million, about $35 million is for Specialty Chemicals in the December quarter prior to spin-off.
After investing the capital necessary to support and improve our business, WestRock will be able to return significant capital to stockholders. During the past 12 months, the combined companies paid $310 million in dividends and bought 265 million of stock. We would have bought back more stock had we not been prevented from doing so as a result of the merger. We've increased the annual dividend rate to $1.50 per share or $400 million, and we're in a position to buy back up to 40 million shares of stock to move to and maintain our target leverage ratio that's in the range of 2.25 to 2.50x.
I like the management team of the combined company. This group has come together extremely well, and we're working together effectively to move our company forward. As many of you know, our corporate management team, including me, our Chief Financial, accounting, human resource and sustainability officers as well as our general counsel, are all located in Norcross. Our Chief Communications and Chief Strategy Officers will be relocating to Norcross. We will continue to have a very significant presence in Richmond, which will be the location of our consumer paperboard, beverage and home, health & beauty businesses as well as the center of our research and development functions for the entire company and WestRock University, the center of our talent development activities.
The work that we've done on integrating the businesses, the work we've done on the dividend, share repurchases and the capital budget, the work we've done to put our organization in place, combined with the strong results we posted for the June quarter, provide us with a firm foundation and momentum as we enter the first year of WestRock.
I'll now turn the call over to Ward, and I'll come back after Ward's comments and wrap up the call. Ward?"

We had strong growth in segment income with an increase of $32 million. The combination of price and mix was a negative $34 million, related primarily to the decline in export containerboard and pulp pricing over the last year. There has been some price and mix decline in box pricing over the last year, but only at approximately 1.5%. 
Cost deflation continued to be a benefit during the quarter with reductions on both recycled fiber and virgin fiber. Recycled fiber prices were down approximately 23% from last year. Our overall virgin fiber costs were down 3.8% from last year from a combination of lower prices, capital investments and the implementation over the last 2 years of our new wood-buying strategy.
We continue to make strong productivity gains, generating $31 million in benefit in the quarter with good momentum as we move to the $1 billion target for combined merger-related synergy and performance improvements. D&A, a noncash item, was $9 million unfavorable. Last year, we recognized a $9 million gain, recording previously unreported spare parts inventories.
MWV segment income improved by $14 million over last year despite the effects of currency. Cost deflation was a $12 million benefit with gains in energy, fiber and chemicals. Ongoing productivity and margin improvement programs created $21 million in higher earnings and provided good platform for our current initiatives. Pension income was $13 million lower on a quarterly basis.
Immediately after the merger announcement, we started on the integration analysis and preparation and developed detailed plans for every synergy opportunity. We engaged outside advisers to help us on certain areas. The $1 billion target includes both companies' specific cost-reduction and performance improvement targets of approximately $700 million and the merger-related synergies target of $300 million. Over 1/2 of the $1 billion target will come from our ongoing productivity and performance improvement programs across our manufacturing footprint and cost savings from capital investments, almost 30% will be from procurement opportunities and the remainder will be from manufacturing optimization and reductions from the elimination of duplicate corporate cost and support functions. The $1 billion performance improvement savings will be realized at about 1/3 over each of the next 3 years. We expect to realize a run rate of $150 million in savings by the end of September. The elimination of duplicate corporate expenses will be realized quickly. We have developed concrete plans behind each of these areas and have pushed the savings goals down to each business and function. Everyone will be held accountable for realizing these targets. 
Total transaction-related costs were approximately $115 million, and the estimated cost for us to capture the merger-related synergies are approximately $100 million. We estimate 20% to 30% of this will be paid from pension plan assets. I want to highlight that the $1 billion is before inflation. Labor benefits and insurance expense accounts for approximately $3.5 billion per year, and normal inflation on this category should be approximately $100 million per year. The balance of our inflation will depend on commodity price trends and could add another $125 million to $175 million in inflation per year. We will update the investment community on our progress against our target as part of our quarterly results. 
We bring a disciplined cost focus to the business and are instilling that view across 42,000 employees. We are currently rolling out allocations of the applicable corporate overhead costs to each business and call center, and we know from our past that it drives full accountability and visibility across the organization. By fully allocating costs, the businesses are able to challenge the corporate departments on their cost and spending, and management can determine where the best returns in investments should be made, if at all.
Our post merger balance sheet is very strong as opening leverage is approximately 2x and our maturities are very well spaced out. Both S&P and Moody's reaffirmed their ratings on WestRock at investment grade. Our $4.9 billion bank financing package has attractive terms and, combined with our other facilities, provides us with more than $3.5 billion of current available liquidity to execute on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. With leverage at 2x and our stock price at these levels, we have an opportunity to move rather quickly to increase our leverage toward our 2.25x to 2.5x leverage target. Our current debt mix is 62% fixed and 38% floating. Our combined average interest rate is about 4.7%. Our marginal cost to borrow on our available lines is less than 1.35%.
Before turning back to Steve, let me provide you an overview of some of the key assumptions that will help you in your modeling of our September quarter. Although our purchase price accounting work is not yet finalized, $270 million is our current estimate of depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter. Of that, approximately $70 million is quarterly intangible amortization expense or $280 million on an annual basis. This will flow through our SG&A line and should be considered when making comparisons of our SG&A expense versus peers. We will do everything we can to drive unnecessary costs out of our business. For example, we are actively working to sublease the entire New York Park Avenue office space, and we'll seek to sublease currently available space enrichment. We're evaluating other opportunities to sublease available space across our company.
Effective with our July 2 pension plan margin, we are approximately 109% funded on a GAAP basis in our U.S. plans and are embarking on a derisking liability-driven pension investment strategy that is approximately 80% bonds. The corresponding expected return on the asset portfolio is 5.87%, which is reducing our forecasted pension income to about $8 million for the quarter. By moving immediately on merging the pension plans, we saved $14 million in pension contributions that would have been due on July 15.
We have provided a cost of goods sold breakout, which outlines our cost pools across our entire manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have provided 8 annual commodity consumption volumes to help you. The current estimated annual dollars spend across these 8 categories is approximately $2.8 billion. 
As we think about our foreign -- our exposure to foreign currencies, we look at our geographic revenue mix overall, which is 79% North American and 21% outside of this region. Of this 21%, approximately half is comprised of exports, of containerboard and paperboard that are priced primarily in U.S. dollars. The remainder is sold in local currency. Our largest foreign currency exposures are related to the euro and the Brazilian real. We estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against these currencies would have a $30 million negative impact to EBT on an annual basis.
Back to you, Steve."

This includes overall containerboard, paperboard and packaging markets while materials prices are also relatively stable. With respect to the outlook for the September quarter, we expect that the performance trends we have seen over the past quarter will continue and that our success in the quarter will be influenced by how we perform and maintain our momentum, including capturing the opportunities available to us as a result of the merger.
When we announced the merger on January 26, we said that, together, we're creating a global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging, a company with true competitive advantages, including an outstanding organization, a market-focused, customer-centric strategy and scale. We said that we'd be leveraging the strengths of both companies into a larger, more balanced and more global business, that the combined company would have an enhanced presence in the marketplace that will provide substantial opportunities for profitable growth. We said that we'd have the financial strength and flexibility to enable this growth.
All that remains true 6 months later. In fact, after 6 months, I feel even better about this combination, WestRock, than I did in January. We have a strong foundation and a near-term road map to capture the $1 billion in merger-related synergy and performance improvement opportunities by the end of fiscal 2018, and we're very focused on cash flow generation overall. Corrugated and Consumer Packaging are attractive businesses where scale and differentiation matter. We offer a set of products and services and scale that can't be offered by any other company. This provides us the opportunity to grow. We have the cash flow available to invest for growth on a disciplined basis and also the ability to return significant cash to stockholders via dividends and share repurchases.

Examples being that we acquired the Smurfit-Stone assets in 2011, and they just had a very unsustainably low level of inventory that was not capable of providing our internal packaging operations.

Both wood and recovered fiber will likely have some upward inflationary trend, but we would guess those to be in balance as recovery rates increase globally and the marketplace plays out.

This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new company.

I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new company. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our WestRock S-4 filing and most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, RockTenn and MeadWestvaco. 
We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.
Since we announced the merger in January, we've been working on integrating the predecessor organizations into WestRock. We have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets, and we've made substantial progress in structuring our organization, externally, with our customers and suppliers and, internally, across our 275 operating and business locations around the world. We've identified and organized ourselves to capture the synergies and performance improvements that we have available to us from the merger and also from the momentum both organizations had going into the merger. We're very excited about the strength of our new company and the opportunity to create real value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I feel good about the progress we're making to develop the WestRock culture.
Of course, our success depends on delivering strong results. With that in mind, I'm turning to what we've done in the most recent quarter. Because the merger closed on July 1, we're not reporting consolidated WestRock results this quarter. We are reporting RockTenn's complete financial results for the June quarter. We're also reporting net sales and segment income information from MeadWestvaco. We don't plan to report the complete financial results of MeadWestvaco for the June quarter. I understand this may be of interest to the investment community. We chose not to maintain the administrative infrastructure and incur the expense necessary to report MeadWestvaco's complete financial results. The segment results show the detail regarding the current performance of our business, and we're providing details about the combined results of both companies in our new segment reporting structure.
We've accomplished a tremendous amount since announcing the merger 6 months ago, and I want to thank the WestRock team for maintaining our focus on serving our customers and operating very efficiently while, at the same time, working diligently on integration. The financial results in the June quarter for each predecessor company bear this out. RockTenn's adjusted EPS of $1.15 increased by 17% over last year. MWV segment income increased by 7%. Our combined segment income was up 10%. I'm particularly pleased with the strong returns in the WestRock Corrugated Packaging business in North America and Brazil. In our Consumer Packaging business, folding carton, food & beverage and home, health & beauty all performed well. 
We're delivering on the envisioned benefits of our combination, at the time we announced the merger, we committed to a $300 million merger-related synergy target that represented approximately 7% of the revenue of MWV packaging business. This was on top of the approximate $700 million in the ongoing contribution the programs we already had in place to improve productivity through process improvement and capital investment. Going forward, we'll track the total $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target. 
The overall goal is more readily identifiable on our financial statements and will avoid the non-value-added effort of determining whether an individual action is merger or performance-related. We expect to reach the $1 billion target before the impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year 2018. This represents approximately 7% of our total revenue, excluding the Specialty Chemicals business. By the end of this September quarter, we expect to be at a run rate of $150 million in merger-related synergies and performance improvements.
An additional benefit of the merger is the ability to combine the overfunded MWV pension plans with the underfunded RockTenn plans. During the first week of July, we merged our U.S.-qualified pension plans. And as a result, we will avoid over $550 million in future pension contributions, including $14 million that would've otherwise been contributed on July 15. 
Our confidence in achieving our future cash flows supports our stockholder return strategy that we announced on July 1 and is comprised of $1.50 per share dividend and a 40 million share repurchase authorization that we intend to use to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.50x. Our pro forma leverage at closing was right at 2x.
WestRock will report our results in 4 business segments. Corrugated Packaging will generate approximately $2 billion in quarterly sales and will include the RockTenn North American corrugated packaging business and recycling business and MWV Brazilian and Indian corrugated packaging businesses. At $1.7 billion in quarterly sales, Consumer Packaging will include RockTenn's consumer packaging and merchandising displays business and MWV's food & beverage and home, health & beauty businesses. Specialty Chemicals and Land and Development will continue as separate segments.
Sales of our Corrugated Packaging business are approximately $8 billion per year with the production of 8.5 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades. Of our 8 million tons of production in North America, our box plant system converts about 5 million tons per year into corrugated packaging. The remaining 3 million tons are sold to independent corrugated converters in North America and other international markets. 
We've operated an integrated system in Brazil for over 60 years. In 2013, we completed the $500 million investment, including a new paper machine to grow our Corrugated Packaging business. About 2/3 of our approximate 500,000 tons of production is converted in our own box plants. I visited these operations last month. I was very impressed with the quality of the assets and the outstanding team we have in place there.
Turning to the results for the June quarter for our combined Corrugated Packaging segment. Industry demand for corrugated packaging in the United States increased by 1.3% as measured by daily box shipments compared to last year. Exports grew by approximately 11% compared to last year. We exported 316,000 tons during the quarter, 30,000 tons more than both the March quarter and last year's quarter. Industry operating rates continue to be solid in the 96% range. We delivered very strong results in North America as measured by our 200 basis point EBITDA margin improvement to 19.4%.
The performance of our box plant system was a highlight of the quarter. Our volumes increased by 3.9% compared to last year. In July, we've maintained this performance. Box volumes are up 4% over last year. We continue to benefit from the cumulative impact of many areas of improvement executed by our team over the past 4 years, including quality and customer service. We're now halfway through the installation of 30 EVOL flexo folder gluers. Our results to date have exceeded our expectations.
Overall, corrugated box pricing in North America was up 0.6% as compared to the March quarter and down 1.5% compared to last year. Pricing of domestic containerboard increased about 1% on a sequential basis and also increased about 1% as compared to last year. Average export pricing declined by 1% from the March quarter and was down 8.5% compared to last year due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Pricing for containerboard for export to Latin America remains stable.
Linerboard continues to be tight, but we've -- we have taken some economic downtime in medium to match our supply with our demand. During the June quarter, we took 104,000 tons of maintenance downtime and less than 20,000 tons of economic downtime. We expect only 4,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter.
Our recycling operation improved profitability during the quarter with segment income of $2.5 million after a loss in the March quarter of $400,000. This was a result of rising recycle prices and a strong operational cost focus. Consistent with recycling's primary mission of sourcing high-quality fiber for our mills, in June, the recycling group started exporting 6,000 tons per month to our India mills. This has improved fiber quality and reduced our delivered costs.
Turning to Brazil. Economic conditions remain challenging. While industry demand declined by 2%, we delivered outstanding results with box volume growth of 15% year-over-year. EBITDA margins of 28.7% were very strong, up 530 basis points compared to last year. We're seeing gains with major national meat and produce customers as well as growth in food oils and chemical markets. We were successful in raising prices to offset cost inflation.
The new containerboard machine in Brazil continues to operate extremely well. June quarter shipments of 125,000 tons set a record and were 7% higher than 1 year ago. We are integrating the North American containerboard export business with our export business in Brazil to increase our efficiency and the value we can provide to international customers.
Sales in our Consumer Packaging business are approximately $7 billion per year. Mill production is approximately 4 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades. All of our mill production is in North America. Our largest mill is Mahrt Alabama, which produces over 1 million tons of coated natural kraft. Our SBS system produces 2.1 million tons from mills in: Covington, Virginia; Demopolis, Alabama; Evadale, Texas; and La Tuque, Québec. We serve markets with high-quality requirements, including food and beverage, tobacco and commercial print markets. The recent acquisition of the Carolina-branded product line from International Paper improves our position in this attractive segment of the commercial print markets. Our recycled system includes 9 mills producing 1 million tons of coated and uncoated recycled paperboard. Our folding carton system consists of 34 plants across North America and Europe and generate sales of about $2 billion. 
The WestRock Consumer Packaging business includes our home, health & beauty dispensing business with approximately $600 million in sales. The combination of our dispensing business with our paper packaging businesses provides a unique, differentiated offering to these customers, and we're fully exploring these opportunities with our customers with very good success. Interestingly, the top 4 home, health & beauty customers account for more than $150 million in sales, and these same customers purchase 500 million of corrugated boxes, folding cartons and displays from WestRock.
Packaging has a very significant impact on our customer's success in their markets. The breadth, depth and scale of WestRock's Consumer and Corrugated Packaging solutions capabilities provides us with a unique opportunity to engage our customers to work together with us to help them be successful. Many of our customers are engaging with us on that very basis. I don't think any other company has the same opportunity, and I'm optimistic about what I've seen so far that I believe that we are and will be able to provide perspective, products and services that will support our customers' success and provide a runway of growth for WestRock.
Turning to the results for the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall industry mill operating rates are stable with CRB showing the greatest strength. Industry backlogs for CRB are 33% higher than last year, and our backlogs are approximately 4 to 5 weeks. We recently informed our customers of a $50 per ton price increase for CRB effective next month. Industry SBS backlogs have weakened since last year, and our system backlogs are at approximately 3 to 4 weeks. After a good beverage season, demand for coated natural kraft remains solid, and backlogs are roughly 4 to 5 weeks. 
The food and beverage business reported a 13% increase in income on flat sales and overcame currency headwinds that reduced sales by $22 million and income by $5 million. Beverage sales reflected volume growth and share gains in global beer that were offset by on-growing -- ongoing weakness in carbonated soft drink sales. All major regions, including North America, Europe and Asia, contributed to our overall sales growth in beverage. Our food business in the quarter was mixed with ongoing weak demand in the U.S. retail food markets. Despite this, we saw demand growth in food service, tobacco and selected retail food applications. During the quarter, we also began successfully onboarding the Carolina business and will transition to full production from International Paper at the end of the calendar year.
For the RockTenn consumer packaging system, sales were flat with last year while income increased by 11%. EBITDA margins improved by 140 basis points to 17.9%. Our converted volumes increased by 4% over the prior year as we captured new business, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities in our folding carton system. Over the last 18 months, we've started up new presses on our: Knoxville, Tennessee; Nicholasville, Kentucky; and Clinton, Iowa plants.
Moving to our merchandising displays business. Industry demand for promotional displays are soft, driven by a number of factors, including the shift to the clean floor policy of a major retailer. Merchandising displays sales declined by 13% compared to last year. While income declined compared to last year, income more than doubled compared to the March quarter. We're working to match our cost structure to our anticipated levels of business through a number of actions, including streamlining our operations and have announced the closure of facilities in: Tullahoma, Tennessee; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Lima, Ohio.
In the home, health & beauty system, income improved by 18% on lower sales, continuing the productivity improvement trends that we've seen for the past several quarters. Sales declined by 12% compared to the prior year, but decreased only 4% on a constant currency basis. The negative currency translation impact was expected as more than 30% of these sales are from Western Europe. The business executed very well commercially and operationally. We continue to gain volume in value-added segments, including fragrance and trigger sprayers.
Specialty Chemicals is a $1 billion business with EBITDA margins of over 25%. About 75% of the business produces performance chemicals, including asphalt additives, oilfield chemicals and a variety of other products. The performance chemical business adapts its refining process to changing market demand. As an example, when demand for oilfield chemicals has declined, we've been able to produce other products, including our asphalt additive products, to mitigate the impact of this change in market demand. The activated carbon business accounts for 25% of the segment revenue, has a very strong position in global automative -- automotive markets. The business has grown and sustained attractive profitability based on its consistent ability to identify opportunities and bring value-added solutions to market. 
We've been investing to expand capacity in Specialty Chemicals. Capital expenditures have been $100 million over the past 12 months, which includes our estimate of ongoing maintenance capital needs of $35 million per year. The most significant growth project has been in China, where we've invested in a greenfield activated carbon plant that will increase our capacity to serve the global automotive market by 15%. This plant will help us maintain our leadership in activated carbon, which is expected to grow with new more stringent global automotive emission requirements being phased in over the next several years.
As much as we like the Specialty Chemicals business, it's not core to WestRock, and we continue to work towards spinning this business off into a new company called Ingevity. We're well into our CEO search and expect to make an announcement in August. We intend to file the initial Form 10 in September. While we anticipate that we will be prepared to initiate the spin at the end of December, we're following guidance from our advisers that the best timing, from an equity capital markets perspective, will be to launch the spin-off to stockholders during the March quarter of 2016.
For the June quarter, Specialty Chemicals revenue declined 8%, but was down 4% on a currency-adjusted basis. Currency headwinds impacted the top line by $11 million. The business had record sales of asphalt additives and activated carbon in the quarter, partially offsetting weakness in oilfield chemicals in other markets. Our patented warm mix paving solution, Evotherm, had strong performance in the U.S. and Europe. Awareness of the performance and sustainability benefits of Evotherm continue to grow.
The activated carbon business remains strong with a growing portion of sales coming from higher-value solutions that address the more stringent automotive emission standards mandated by U.S. regulatory agencies that phase in beginning in 2017. Segment EBITDA margins were 26.7%. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA margins were 27.9%. The business continues to perform exceptionally well.
WestRock Land and Development is our legacy land development business, which, after entitling approximately 100,000 acres for development, selling over 1 million acres of timber and recreational land for over $2 billion over the last 8 years, is now focused on the value-added monetization of the remaining approximately 80,000 acres of development land, primarily located in and around Charleston, South Carolina. Most of the projects are held in partnerships with Plum Creek Land Company and others and are managed by WestRock.
Growth trends in the Charleston, South Carolina market are very positive. The Port of Charleston's growing. Boeing continues to expand its 787 manufacturing facility. Daimler Benz is building a new $500 million sprinter van manufacturing facility, which will employ 1,300 people, and Volvo recently announced the construction of a $500 million manufacturing facility that will employ 2,000 people. Last Friday, WestRock sold a 6,600-acre track for $34 million for Volvo's new manufacturing facility. It's nearby commercial and industrial land holdings and master-planned communities, including Nexton and Summers Corner, are well positioned to benefit from the on-growing -- ongoing regional growth around Charleston.
We expect these very favorable dynamics to support the acceleration of development land sales over the coming quarters. We're continuing to pursue the disciplined development of infrastructure and facilities necessary to match the increased demand for land from users, developers and homebuilders at a pace that maximizes value for stockholders.
WestRock will generate significant cash flow that will be available to be reinvested in the business or returned to stockholders. We have and will focus on capital allocations critical to our success, and we expect to have attractive opportunities to invest in our business. We've invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures in our business during the past 2 years, including $865 million during the past 12 months. These investments include the new paper machine in Brazil, a new biomass boiler at our Covington, Virginia mill, a new woodyard in Florence, South Carolina, 15 new EVOL flexo folder gluers in our box plant system, the new activated carbon plant in China. WestRock stockholders are the beneficiaries of these investments.
We've recently completed our capital budget for fiscal year 2016. The capital budget process has included identifying projects through the multiple lenses of: the market, our business strategy, the situation in individual locations. We've prioritized these projects by business and location in light of the aggregate fit with our business strategy. We plan to invest approximately $850 million in capital during fiscal 2016. We estimate maintenance capital to be $500 million. For the $350 million in return-generating projects, we expect to return unlevered after tax returns in the range of 20%.
The key return-generating capital projects in the paper solutions business are the Demopolis biomass boiler, the rebuild of the bark boiler at Mahrt, the carbonate cook project at the Stevenson, Alabama mill and the evaporator upgrade at the West Point, Virginia mill. Key return-generating projects within the packaging solutions group include: the installation of 7 additional EVOL flexo folder gluers in our box plants and 3 additional presses at our folding carton plants, along with the conversion of our plant in the Czech Republic from tobacco to beverage operations. We'll make other investments in beverage and home, health & beauty to respond to specific customer requirements. Of the $850 million, about $35 million is for Specialty Chemicals in the December quarter prior to spin-off.
After investing the capital necessary to support and improve our business, WestRock will be able to return significant capital to stockholders. During the past 12 months, the combined companies paid $310 million in dividends and bought 265 million of stock. We would have bought back more stock had we not been prevented from doing so as a result of the merger. We've increased the annual dividend rate to $1.50 per share or $400 million, and we're in a position to buy back up to 40 million shares of stock to move to and maintain our target leverage ratio that's in the range of 2.25 to 2.50x.
I like the management team of the combined company. This group has come together extremely well, and we're working together effectively to move our company forward. As many of you know, our corporate management team, including me, our Chief Financial, accounting, human resource and sustainability officers as well as our general counsel, are all located in Norcross. Our Chief Communications and Chief Strategy Officers will be relocating to Norcross. We will continue to have a very significant presence in Richmond, which will be the location of our consumer paperboard, beverage and home, health & beauty businesses as well as the center of our research and development functions for the entire company and WestRock University, the center of our talent development activities.
The work that we've done on integrating the businesses, the work we've done on the dividend, share repurchases and the capital budget, the work we've done to put our organization in place, combined with the strong results we posted for the June quarter, provide us with a firm foundation and momentum as we enter the first year of WestRock.
I'll now turn the call over to Ward, and I'll come back after Ward's comments and wrap up the call. Ward?"

We had strong growth in segment income with an increase of $32 million. The combination of price and mix was a negative $34 million, related primarily to the decline in export containerboard and pulp pricing over the last year. There has been some price and mix decline in box pricing over the last year, but only at approximately 1.5%. 
Cost deflation continued to be a benefit during the quarter with reductions on both recycled fiber and virgin fiber. Recycled fiber prices were down approximately 23% from last year. Our overall virgin fiber costs were down 3.8% from last year from a combination of lower prices, capital investments and the implementation over the last 2 years of our new wood-buying strategy.
We continue to make strong productivity gains, generating $31 million in benefit in the quarter with good momentum as we move to the $1 billion target for combined merger-related synergy and performance improvements. D&A, a noncash item, was $9 million unfavorable. Last year, we recognized a $9 million gain, recording previously unreported spare parts inventories.
MWV segment income improved by $14 million over last year despite the effects of currency. Cost deflation was a $12 million benefit with gains in energy, fiber and chemicals. Ongoing productivity and margin improvement programs created $21 million in higher earnings and provided good platform for our current initiatives. Pension income was $13 million lower on a quarterly basis.
Immediately after the merger announcement, we started on the integration analysis and preparation and developed detailed plans for every synergy opportunity. We engaged outside advisers to help us on certain areas. The $1 billion target includes both companies' specific cost-reduction and performance improvement targets of approximately $700 million and the merger-related synergies target of $300 million. Over 1/2 of the $1 billion target will come from our ongoing productivity and performance improvement programs across our manufacturing footprint and cost savings from capital investments, almost 30% will be from procurement opportunities and the remainder will be from manufacturing optimization and reductions from the elimination of duplicate corporate cost and support functions. The $1 billion performance improvement savings will be realized at about 1/3 over each of the next 3 years. We expect to realize a run rate of $150 million in savings by the end of September. The elimination of duplicate corporate expenses will be realized quickly. We have developed concrete plans behind each of these areas and have pushed the savings goals down to each business and function. Everyone will be held accountable for realizing these targets. 
Total transaction-related costs were approximately $115 million, and the estimated cost for us to capture the merger-related synergies are approximately $100 million. We estimate 20% to 30% of this will be paid from pension plan assets. I want to highlight that the $1 billion is before inflation. Labor benefits and insurance expense accounts for approximately $3.5 billion per year, and normal inflation on this category should be approximately $100 million per year. The balance of our inflation will depend on commodity price trends and could add another $125 million to $175 million in inflation per year. We will update the investment community on our progress against our target as part of our quarterly results. 
We bring a disciplined cost focus to the business and are instilling that view across 42,000 employees. We are currently rolling out allocations of the applicable corporate overhead costs to each business and cost center, and we know from our past that it drives full accountability and visibility across the organization. By fully allocating costs, the businesses are able to challenge the corporate departments on their cost and spending, and management can determine where the best returns in investments should be made, if at all.
Our post merger balance sheet is very strong as opening leverage is approximately 2x and our maturities are very well spaced out. Both S&P and Moody's reaffirmed their ratings on WestRock at investment grade. Our $4.9 billion bank financing package has attractive terms and, combined with our other facilities, provides us with more than $3.5 billion of current available liquidity to execute on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. With leverage at 2x and our stock price at these levels, we have an opportunity to move rather quickly to increase our leverage toward our 2.25x to 2.5x leverage target. Our current debt mix is 62% fixed and 38% floating. Our combined average interest rate is about 4.7%. Our marginal cost to borrow on our available lines is less than 1.35%.
Before turning back to Steve, let me provide you an overview of some of the key assumptions that will help you in your modeling of our September quarter. Although our purchase price accounting work is not yet finalized, $270 million is our current estimate of depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter. Of that, approximately $70 million is quarterly intangible amortization expense or $280 million on an annual basis. This will flow through our SG&A line and should be considered when making comparisons of our SG&A expense versus peers. We will do everything we can to drive unnecessary costs out of our business. For example, we are actively working to sublease the entire New York Park Avenue office space, and we'll seek to sublease currently available space in Richmond. We're evaluating other opportunities to sublease available space across our company.
Effective with our July 2 pension plan margin, we are approximately 109% funded on a GAAP basis in our U.S. plans and are embarking on a derisking liability-driven pension investment strategy that is approximately 80% bonds. The corresponding expected return on the asset portfolio is 5.87%, which is reducing our forecasted pension income to about $8 million for the quarter. By moving immediately on merging the pension plans, we saved $14 million in pension contributions that would have been due on July 15.
We have provided a cost of goods sold breakout, which outlines our cost pools across our entire manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have provided 8 annual commodity consumption volumes to help you. The current estimated annual dollars spend across these 8 categories is approximately $2.8 billion. 
As we think about our foreign -- our exposure to foreign currencies, we look at our geographic revenue mix overall, which is 79% North American and 21% outside of this region. Of this 21%, approximately half is comprised of exports of containerboard and paperboard that are priced primarily in U.S. dollars. The remainder is sold in local currency. Our largest foreign currency exposures are related to the euro and the Brazilian real. We estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against these currencies would have a $30 million negative impact to EBT on an annual basis.
Back to you, Steve."

This includes overall containerboard, paperboard and packaging markets. Raw material prices are also relatively stable. With respect to the outlook for the September quarter, we expect that the performance trends we have seen over the past quarter will continue and that our success in the quarter will be influenced by how we perform and maintain our momentum, including capturing the opportunities available to us as a result of the merger.
When we announced the merger on January 26, we said that, together, we're creating a global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging, a company with true competitive advantages, including an outstanding organization, a market-focused, customer-centric strategy and scale. We said that we'd be leveraging the strengths of both companies into a larger, more balanced and more global business, that the combined company would have an enhanced presence in the marketplace that will provide substantial opportunities for profitable growth. We said that we'd have the financial strength and flexibility to enable this growth.
All that remains true 6 months later. In fact, after 6 months, I feel even better about this combination, WestRock, than I did in January. We have a strong foundation and a near-term road map to capture the $1 billion in merger-related synergy and performance improvement opportunities by the end of fiscal 2018, and we're very focused on cash flow generation overall. Corrugated and Consumer Packaging are attractive businesses where scale and differentiation matter. We offer a set of products and services and scale that can't be offered by any other company. This provides us the opportunity to grow. We have the cash flow available to invest for growth on a disciplined basis and also the ability to return significant cash to stockholders via dividends and share repurchases.

Examples being that we acquired the Smurfit-Stone assets in 2011, and they just had a very unsustainably low level of inventory that was not capable of providing our internal packaging operations. The ability to perform with appropriate on-time delivery and supply chain costs that were sustainable. And so we, today, focus our inventories on what is the optimal safety stock of doing supply chain math to try to manage that very crisply.

However, it's softened again. So we think, generally, the recovered fiber markets are firm, but we do not see any runaway trend occurring. Relative to long term, it's a global market. Both wood and recovered fiber will likely have some upward inflationary trend, but we would guess those to be in balance as recovery rates increase globally and the marketplace plays out.

This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. Thanks for taking the time to listen to our call today. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
We're looking forward to sharing our results for the September quarter of 2015, which is the first quarter for which we're reporting the results of WestRock.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, these include our WestRock S-4 filing, the most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, the recent Form 10 filed to enable the tax spend of our Specialty Chemicals business.
We will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You may have noticed in our press release on Page 19 of our earnings call deck that we've provided a comparison of our results for the September quarter of 2015 to the September quarter of 2014. This comparison is the reported results of predecessor companies as adjusted for our new segment and other merger-related accounting items, including application of a consistent method for allocating corporate cost. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation that's available on our website.
We've performed well in our first quarter of operations as WestRock. The most appropriate place for me to start is by thanking all of my WestRock coworkers who have continued to take care of our customers, operate safely and deliver strong results in a competitive business environment. All are working extremely hard to take advantage of the many opportunities that we have the newly merged company. We continue to have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We're making significant strides in areas that are driving value from the merger, including the integration of our organizations, the realization of the merger-related synergies and performance improvements and the opportunities we have to provide a broad range of paper and packaging solutions to help our customers succeed in their markets.
We reported $0.93 of adjusted earnings per share and generated $268 million of free cash flow after adding back the after-tax cost of transaction fees and restructuring cost.
We executed exceptionally well in our packaging businesses. Our North American box business increased volumes by 2.9% on a per day basis in the quarter. This compares to a less than 1% increase for the industry over the same time frame. Our containerboard mill system is operating efficiently. The North American Corrugated Packaging business earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%. The Corrugated Packaging business in Brazil is operating exceptionally well and earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% in the September quarter.
Our consumer mill system is also operating well, and published price increases across the recycled grades. There's positive momentum in folding carton the merchandising displays, and I'll have more color on each of those shortly.
Specialty Chemicals sales of activated carbon and asphalt additives were at record levels, but those gains were more than offset by lower sales to oilfield drilling and industrial markets. EBITDA margins were 24.9%. And initial Form 10 was filed on October 6. We're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.
We're progressing toward our $1 billion in annualized synergy and performance improvements to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018. We generated annualized run rate savings at quarter-end in excess of $150 million, and we expect annualized run rate savings of at least $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016.
We're executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter at 2.08 leverage, slightly under our stated target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5x.
We completed the SP Fiber acquisition on October 1. The Dublin, Georgia mills an excellent asset and provides a valuable product mix and adds logistical flexibility within our system. The and newsprint and containerboard machines were idled in our first month of operation due to market conditions in this front and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard mill system. We continue to expect performance improvements in excess of $50 million over 3 years for the transaction to be accretive in the second half of fiscal 2016.
On October 12, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gandhi for our packaging businesses in Mexico. Gondi is a high-quality paperboard manufacturer and packaging converter for many local and global brand-name customers. Our partnership will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexico market. We expect to begin operations as a joint venture as soon as we receive Mexican regulatory approval, which we expect will take 4 to 6 months.
We repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $60.20. We were and continue to be limited in the number of shares we can buy as a result of our need to maintain at least a 50.1% ownership interest by legacy MWV stockholders as of July 1, 2015. This continuity of ownership is necessary to preserve the tax-free separation of the Specialty Chemicals business from WestRock. We have been and are able to buy back shares up to the exact overlapping investor ownership of our predecessor companies at the specific funnel level as of July 1. We have sufficient repurchase opportunity available to us to operate within our target leverage ratio range.
I will now provide more details on our overall results and performance in each business segment before turning it over to Ward, and then I'll come back to provide thoughts on the outlook for our December quarter.
When we compare WestRock's results in the September quarter to the combined recast results in the same quarter of last year, sales declined by $203 million or 5%. This decline was largely comprised of $141 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $44 million of revenue from the European tobacco converting business sold earlier in the year. Adjusted segment EBITDA, net of corporate cost, declined by $80 million compared to last year due to foreign currency translation impact of $26 million. The absence of the $23 million gain we recorded last year due to the write up of spare parts inventory in our mill system and $26 million in lower pension income. WestRock's credit agreement EBITDA and EBITDA margins over the last 12 months are in excess of $2.5 billion and 16.9%, respectively.
Let's turn to each of our segments.  WestRock's Corrugated Packaging team performed well in the September quarter, especially considering the headwinds we faced in the quarter from a weaker global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales declined by $75 million or 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up by $20 million or 1%. Of the $95 million in currency headwinds, about 1/2 was in Brazil, 1/3 was due to the Canadian dollar and most of the rest was Mexican peso. Segment income was lower by $39 million, with $23 million of that related to the write up of spare parts last year and $15 million related to currency impacts in Canada, Brazil and India.
Overall segment EBITDA margin was 19.4%. Our North American corrugated margin of 20% and our Brazil margin at 28%. As I referenced earlier, our North American box volumes increased by 2.9% compared to last year, and box pricing in North America was stable. Our box systems have been very successful in the market by focusing on quality and on-time delivery in combination with innovation that's relevant to our customers' needs. This approach has enabled us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base over time, including gains in the quarter with customers for protein and processed foods, snacks, dairy and e-commerce. Our success has been and will be defined by how well we operate on a day-to-day basis in each of our plants and with each of our customers. The scale of the WestRock organization has supported our local success to our capital investment, our investment in people and connecting our coworkers so as to make it easier to share knowledge on how to succeed across the company and with our customers.
We've continued our volume growth in October by increasing sales on a per day basis by more than 3% over last year. Our North American corrugated shipments in the quarter declined by 15,000 tons compared to the June quarter and 57,000 tons or 2.7% compared to last year. Export volumes declined by 29,000 tons compared to last year. Our overall export pricing declined $9 per ton compared to the June quarter and $37 per ton compared to last year.  Prices of containerboard to third-party domestic customers have been within a $5 per ton range since the summer of 2014.
We took approximately 76,000 tons of downtime during the quarter, all except 3,000 tons being economic downtime. In October, we took about 95,000 tons of downtime in our corrugated mill system with approximately 55,000 tons being economic downtime, the remainder being maintenance downtime at our Florence mill.
We've consistently operated our system in a way that balances production with our customer demand. We plan and schedule this balance on an ongoing basis and take actions as needed, including slowbacks, economic downtime, maintenance downtime and permit closures. Our goal is to pursue the actions that we believe will optimize our mill system, thus producing the best economic and operating results for WestRock and our customers. We don't publicly announce our actions. We communicate our plans to the employees, customers and suppliers who'll be most directly impacted. This past month is an example of this planning and execution, which we took actions at several facilities. With the October 1 completion of the SP Fiber transaction, we were able to reassess our overall mill system to determine the optimal way to meet our customer demand. Following this assessment, we announced indefinite downtime at both and ville to immediately match our production to customers' orders. The following week, we announced the permanent closure of the 310,000-ton Ohio mill, which will occur in late November to provide an orderly mill closure and consumption of raw materials, such as chemicals, wood and recovered fiber. The closure of will reduce our annual operating cost by $33 million and avoid an additional $4 million annually in maintenance capital expenditures.
The same week, we announced an indefinite idling of our new board mill due to the unprofitable nature of the newsprint business and an inadequate order book of containerboard and bad grades. The mill will be idled in mid-November. We retain the optionality on the 2 excellent paper machines at Newburgh in the event West Coast demand warrants a restart. All these actions have been well planned and executed and went according to our expectations. When we take economic downtime, we communicate that it is indefinite because the period of downtime may change with market conditions or lead to a permanent closure.
We will continue to operate our system focused on our customers. Our plans to take -- our plan is to take 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime in our corrugated mills during the December quarter. The from being of each paper machine has been restarted and the ville mill is being restarted mid-month as planned to meet our customer demand. We're currently operating with 56,000 tons more inventory than we operated with 1 year ago. This additional inventory has helped improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction, with both our internal and external box plant customers, and it's also reduced logistics cost. This benefit far outweigh the carrying cost of increased investment and inventory. Based on our forecasted sales in major maintenance and capital downtime plan, our containerboard inventories will gradually build an additional 30,000 tons from the end of September till they peak in the January, February time frame, then we would expect them to return to our current level over the following few months.
In Brazil, the economic situation continues be challenging, and our great team in the regions managed to continue to deliver very strong results, including adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.2% and sales growth of 10% on a local currency basis. Our industry box demand declined by more than 5%. We grew box volume by 3% year-over-year with strength in protein, produce and export markets.
In September, our mill in Brazil set new production and shipment records. The interaction between our North American Brazilian corrugated teams has benefited both businesses, so we've been able to drive improved productivity at our mills and box plants.
In 2016, GDP in Brazil is expected to decline by approximately 2%, and industrial production is expected to decline by approximately 6%. Our corrugated business in Brazil is not immune to these challenges. We expect to continue to perform well due to our high-quality assets, customer service and the differentiation of our virgin-based paper and packaging offerings.
In the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall results reflect good commercial and operational execution in the face of some difficult macro headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales in the segment declined $140 million or 8% when compared to last year. This includes $37 million of negative impact from currency. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $14 million lower due to $8 million of foreign exchange impact and $4 million from the sale of the European tobacco business. Segment EBITDA margins were 15.6%.
In the paperboard markets, our SBS group service volumes grew, and our folding carton and food markets are doing well. Industry SBS backlog are 393,000 tons, somewhat lower than the 454,000 tons the same time last year. Our backlogs are 3.5 weeks.
We're making very good progress integrating the Carolina brand that we acquired earlier this year. Sales during the quarter were at a rate equivalent to 180,000 tons per year. We expect to fully transition manufacturing to our facilities by the end of December. One of the first opportunities from the merger was to integrate SBS tons into our folding carton system, and we're already more than halfway to achieving a full annual run rate of 50,000 tons by the end of December. During the quarter, these domestic SBS shipments more than offset softer exports for tobacco and liquid packaging grades.
Industry backlogs for coated recycle board remained strong at approximately 165,000 tons, which is more than 40% higher than this time last year. WestRock CRB backlogs are greater than 4% -- 4 [ph] weeks. We're moving production of our millennium board product from our Dallas and Stratford mills to the Mahrt mill. We're backfilling both Galveston with additional CRB business. Demand for CMK remains solid, and our backlogs are nearly 4 weeks. Those shipments grew by more than 3%, supported by growth from our beverage system.
In North America, we largely offset declines in carbonated volumes with gains with our larger brewer customers, continued growth with kraft brewers and gains in the word. In Europe, we saw stronger sales with our larger brewer customers. On the Asia Pacific region, we saw improvement in carbonated soft drinks and dairy packaging.
Our broader folding carton business also performed extremely well. We shared gains in new business in categories such as on-the-go foods, offsetting declines in areas such as cereal. Our general folding carton volumes were up 2% during the quarter, a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year growth. Our operational performance in our carton facilities was also strong with better plant loading and efficiency gains. Our home, health & beauty business improved income and margins due to favorable mix from sales of trigger sprayers and health care dispensing systems as well as productivity gains.
And then our Merchandising Displays business, we saw a strong rebound with quarterly earnings up 55% over the prior year. After a challenging year that included some sales decline, we're seeing signs of growth and a strengthening market for promotional displays. Our decisions over the last couple of years to strategically invest capital to lower our cost has had a significant positive impact. We've invested in our innovation platform and that's supporting our growth in new markets, including recently earning awards of new business that helped in the year in a very positive work. Many of our customers are learning more about our capabilities. We've taken advantage of these opportunities to discuss our full product line and to learn about our customers' objectives, so we can develop paper and packaging solutions that help our customers meet their objectives.
Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform well in the face of the slowdown in drilling and other industrial activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain very attractive at 24.9%, even as sales declined by $26 million compared to last year. Integrity is starting up a new activated carbon plant in China this quarter and expanding our chemicals plant in Brazil at the first of the year. The activated carbon plant in China will provide needed capacity for our global system that supports the growing automotive sector.
We're making good progress in qualifying the new production with our automotive customers in Asia and beyond and expect sales to ramp up in the first half of next year.
The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for Specialty Chemicals. This is principally due to the winter slowdown in road-paving activity. We expect continued challenges in the oilfield sector, which impacts the segment sales levels and margins.
I'm very pleased that both Michael Wilson and John Fortson have joined Longevity as CEO and CFO, respectively. They both bring tremendous and highly relevant experience to the business. We have confidence in their ability to lead Longevity through these challenges and growth as an independent company.
The spinoff of Longevity is moving forward. The initial Form 10 was filed, and we're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016 spin date.
The Land and Development business continues to make good progress on their major projects in the Charleston region. The business had a fantastic quarter from a revenue standpoint with $45 million in revenue, including a $34 million gain related to the 68 -- I mean, the sales for $34 million related to the 6,800-acre site that Volvo acquired to build their new U.S. manufacturing facility. But due to the impact of purchase price accounting, we're revaluing their existing projects to fair value. They lost $3 million on a GAAP basis. The step-up in book value had a $15 million negative impact on segment income in the quarter. This marketing to fair market value of our land portfolio in this business will reduce future profitability on existing projects, but it does not impact future cash flows. As part of the valuation work, we have developed a project-by-project valuation of the partnership, which for our share, is over $400 million. The experienced team in this business is executing on a plan to maximize this potential value. We're considering ways to monetize that value at a faster pace.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward Dickson. Ward?"

The change in labor and benefits was approximately $29 million, and there was $9 million of combined deflation in commodity and other cost categories.
The total impact of price and mix changes was minimal in the quarter. Corrugated Packaging had positive price/mix variance in due -- in part due to domestic box pricing, higher prices in Brazil, lower volumes of exports and domestic tons shipped and an increase in higher-margin box shipments. There was some decline in price and mix in the Consumer Packaging grades and Specialty Chemicals.
Noncash pension income was $26 million lower than last year due to, among other things, lower return on asset assumptions as we de-risked our pension plans; the nonrecurring amount of $29 million includes $23 million from last year's spare parts gains that didn't recur this year.
We made significant progress during our first quarter as WestRock toward our $1 billion synergy and productivity improvement target. We entered the quarter at a run rate of $75 million in savings and exited at an annualized run rate in excess of $150 million, which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. This is a significant objective that will take a lot of work over the next 3 years to capture. Our entire organization is focused on meeting these objectives, and we have consistent monitoring and processes in place to make sure we stay on track, so we are confident in our ability to reach $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. We estimate that we will be at an annualized run rate of at least $400 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016.
Our total SG&A costs for the quarter were $429 million or 11% of sales. However, this total includes $64 million in ongoing merger and acquisition-related intangible amortization cost that flow through the $281 million depreciation and amortization line on our cash flow. Excluding intangible and amortization, our SG&A costs are running at 9.4% of sales and will trend lower as we execute on our synergy and performance improvement program.
We have completed our work to allocate corporate cost to the appropriate business units, all the way down to the cost in our level. The full cost allocation brings further visibility into spending and business unit profitability. When comparing legacy RockTenn and MWV, approximately 70% of RockTenn's corporate costs were allocated to the business units and MWV was approximately 30% allocated. There was also some geography changes in the allocation work as some legacy MWV manufacturing site costs were nonproduction activities in the amount of $18 million removed from cost of goods sold to SG&A. And as Steve said, we have included Slide 19 that provides a reconciliation of reported to recast segment income and EBITDA for Q4 FY '14 for comparability purposes.
We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in recorded debt, and included in that figure is approximately $340 million in fair value step-up to the market value of the legacy MWV debt. The notional amount of what we owe under our debt obligations are approximately $5.3 billion. Our balance sheet is in great shape as we have $3.4 billion in available liquidity to support our strategy and very few maturities over the next several years. Our leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.08x.
Our pension plans are in great shape, and we ended the fiscal year with almost $400 million in combined GAAP-funded status surplus in our qualified U.S. and Canadian pension plans. The U.S. plans were overfunded by more than $500 million, and the Canadian plans were underfunded by more than $100 million. The overfunding in the U.S. plans gives us options as we think about de-risking our balance sheet.
Slide #13 has a number of key financial items to help in modeling our performance. Depreciation and amortization will continue to be approximately $285 million on a quarterly basis. And of that total, intangibles amortization is approximately $70 million. Our CapEx is still estimated at $850 million for the full year. The pension income of $8 million represents both the qualified and nonqualified plan amounts. Our books -- our book tax rate should be in the range of 33% to 35% for the December quarter. The September quarter effective tax rate of 29% was lower than our forecast due to discrete items, primarily at the state tax level.  We are planning scheduled maintenance downtime within our corrugated mill system of 114,000 tons during the quarter.
Other items incorporated in our tax position also included $21.5 million of nontax deductible restructuring fees. Cash spent into contributions into our qualified pension plans are approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016 with almost all of that going into our Canadian plans. Our nonqualified Orser plans will require additional cash funding of approximately $13 million this fiscal year. We have $115 million in state federal and foreign NOLs and $213 million in AMT and other federal credits.
And now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Looking to the immediate future, there's a number of items that will impact our performance in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We're seeing benefits from our performance improvement initiatives. Our domestic box and folding carton businesses continue to do well compared to the market. Energy prices are lower, which is a positive for us. There's 3 less shipping days this quarter, and the December quarter historically has lower seasonal sales volumes than the September quarter. Maintenance and economic downtime will have negative earnings impact. The euro and Brazilian real have both softened from September averages, and we expect return to normal tax rates. Considering all of these items in the quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be lower in the December quarter as compared to last quarter.
Looking further out, WestRock aspires to be the global leader in corrugated and consumer packaging. The first step for WestRock to achieve this aspiration is to combine and integrate our organizations and in the process, capture $1 billion in merger-related efficiencies and productivity improvements. We're on the road to capture this opportunity over the next 3 years. We've made a lot of progress in our business in just 4 months. We've made progress building our culture at WestRock, progress making our operations more efficient and more importantly, progress teaming with our packaging customers to grow their share in the marketplace. While paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, the global economy, a strong U.S. dollar, intense competition challenges across our businesses. We're responding to these challenges with urgency, both to deliver short-term results, but also to keep our eye on the long-term opportunity we have within our sights. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that are ahead of us and believe we're making excellent progress in the long-term value creation opportunities we have as WestRock.

And so we're constantly in a situation of designing the optimal portfolio production capacity to meet that demand. And with the addition of the SP Fiber acquisition, which we were delighted to close October 1, gave us the opportunity to really reassess our containerboard system and to make some important moves, utilizing those excellent assets at Dublin to better optimize our supply capability to our customers and improve our cost structure. So we were able to immediately take some capacity -- production capacity out with the indefinite idling of the Fernandina Beach paper machine 3 and the ville facilities followed quickly by the announcement of the permanent closure of the mill, which takes some time to properly close in order to provide an orderly shutdown and to optimally consume chemicals, raw materials, fiber, wood, et cetera. And we also then followed that same week with the indefinite idling of the Newburgh facility because of the weakness of the newsprint markets and to, again, balance our supply-demand scenario. So all of those decisions were executed to improve our capability to serve our customers and to improve our cost structure. We now are able to bring back the Fernandina Beach facility, which is an excellent paper machine-producing high-quality virgin containerboard for our domestic and international markets and ville recycled mill will also return. So that's -- we operated that balancing in a way that supported our customers well and improved our cost structure and as to the types of activities, you'll see us focusing on in the future."

And then along those lines as well, what may have changed with dynamics between the time you announced things in August until we got to October that perhaps it sounds like, I think, my understanding is the majority of it or the bulk of the mills are closed."

And that we bought were 4 big, wide, fast low-cost paper machines and gives us lots of optionality in the production of containerboard grades as well as lightweight kraft bag, et cetera. And so we're really quite pleased with having those assets, particularly Dublin. The Dublin mill, extremely well laid out, very efficient, a lot of upside potential for further improvement in their cost structure by operating as a part of our larger containerboard systems. So we just see exceptional opportunity. The Newburgh mill all along with the newsprint production at that mill was one in which we were we knew would be challenging. And the newsprint market, I think you all understand as well as we do, is on a continuing decline. So what we have in newsprint in Newburgh is the optionality on in these 2 excellent big wide, fast paper machines that give us the opportunity to consider what future needs may be for those assets. But currently, we're indefinitely idling them, and that improves the cash flow of the acquisition and the earnings in that case."

For example, the pavement technologies or asphalt emulsifiers that we have in that business, which Arizona largely does not have, are very attractive and performed extremely well. Record sales in the last quarter. So it is a data point that I would say there's also a lot of apples and oranges. So I wouldn't take it too literally."

Steve mentioned in his prepared comments it had a terrific quarter, and they continue to build on this track record of improvement that you have seen in the business over the last 2 years now, which has come from a combination of things. It's been a better commercial strategy targeting more attractive niches in the global market, better plant loadings and better productivity. And we have made incremental investments in that business that are required to support our customers, our partners with the particular rollout. So it's all working together and continues to show a very positive trend. In terms of the question, we like it for 3 reasons. One is the overlap that the home, health & beauty dispensing system business has with our other paper and packaging businesses. Roughly, $1 million -- $1 billion of WestRock sales are to customers that buy dispenser products and other paperboard and packaging products from WestRock. We also have really strong relationships with these customers through the dispensing system business because it's a highly technical and innovative business. And so these are more like partnerships, which then we can leverage with our other packaging business. And then finally, it's a global business, which gives us the opportunity to reach beyond the North American borders. So we still feel very good about the fit and the performance."

I think yes, but they are very different situations. Smurfit was an acquisition. This was a merger. And it's great that it's a merger because one of the big issues we had in Smurfit, and I'm put into the category of culture, that we were integrating into our organization. At the time, I was CFO. My job tripled overnight, and then the Smurfit organization had not been successful over a long period of time. And that is continues to be a lesson for me of how that can really impact a culture. This merger is very much different. Because I think most of the people on the call would have known of both companies. And WestRock's bringing the best of both companies to the table. We're highly complementary. I think you can pro forma either company and I guess, we are trying to pro forma both companies going forward. And we've got a tremendous future together, which is better than either company would have on its own. So depending on what side you're on, we can go through enumerate the opportunities. But we effectively, from a culture standpoint, we've put a much greater emphasis on that. And so we are moving beyond this is a merger of 2 companies. It's a creation of a new company, which is WestRock. And we're working together. I'm very optimistic about the future of the company. And I think on -- in the call, I think we focused a lot a very discrete set of actions we took, which I think were misinterpreted by the business. But underlying that, I think we're performing at an exceptional. We're delivering the merger and performance improvements. Somebody asked about is there -- was there a surprise and I would like to think that there's an expectation we're going to go out and get that. But the our meeting that expectation, I'd say, with enthusiasm across the organization. And that's going to end up what we need to do that to be successful. While all that is going on, we have, I think, each one of our business on a day-to-day business was operating exceptionally well. I'm very excited about the reaction we're getting from the customers. They're coming to us and asking us what can -- what's this about and we're having conversation, which it's a little bit early to tell ultimate.

Let me start with a Specialty Chemicals, then we can come back to Consumer Packaging. I think as you know, having all the business, Specialty Chemical business that will become Ingevity, is a highly flexible business around its refinery system. And oilfield technologies has definitely seen the impact of what's happening in the broader sector. But let me give you a couple of statistics to put it in perspective. So well counts -- oil well counts are down about 65% across the industry year-on-year, yet our revenue in that specific sector is only down about 40%. So we're actually taking share in the downmarket in oilfield, which is a market that we really like for its profitability. And that's because we just have really great, highly differentiated products. And at the same time, we're able to shift business over to industrial specialties. Yes, there's been some pricing movement with the dislocations that are occurring and a very modest offset in volume. But as I said earlier in one of my answers, we're able to move into some other areas that help offset that, that volume decline. And asphalt pavement technologies has been an example of that, up 19% versus prior year. So a lot of big movements in the business, but really great effort by the team in managing through what's been a fairly volatile period of time. And I think it'll position them well for the future.

This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. Thanks for taking the time to listen to our call today. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
We're looking forward to sharing our results for the September quarter of 2015, which is the first quarter for which we're reporting the results of WestRock.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These include our WestRock S-4 filing, the most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, the recent Form 10 filed to enable the tax-free spend of our Specialty Chemicals business.
We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You may have noticed in our press release and on Page 19 of our earnings call deck that we've provided a comparison of our results for the September quarter of 2015 to the September quarter of 2014. This comparison is the reported results of predecessor companies as adjusted for our new segment and other merger-related accounting items, including application of a consistent method for allocating corporate cost. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation that's available on our website.
We've performed well in our first quarter of operations as WestRock. The most appropriate place for me to start is by thanking all of my WestRock coworkers who have continued to take care of our customers, operate safely and deliver strong results in a competitive business environment. All are working extremely hard to take advantage of the many opportunities that we have in the newly merged company. We continue to have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets.
We're making significant strides in areas that are driving value from the merger, including the integration of our organizations, the realization of the merger-related synergies and performance improvements, and the opportunities we have to provide a broad range of paper and packaging solutions to help our customers succeed in their markets.
We reported $0.93 of adjusted earnings per share and generated $268 million of free cash flow after adding back the after-tax cost of transaction fees and restructuring cost.
We executed exceptionally well in our packaging businesses. Our North American box business increased volumes by 2.9% on a per day basis in the quarter. This compares to a less than 1% increase for the industry over the same time frame. Our containerboard mill system is operating efficiently. The North American Corrugated Packaging business earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%. The Corrugated Packaging business in Brazil is operating exceptionally well and earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% in the September quarter.
Our consumer mill system is also operating well, and [indiscernible] published price increases across the recycled grades. There's positive momentum in folding carton; home, health & beauty; merchandising displays, and I'll have more color on each of those shortly.
Specialty Chemicals sales of activated carbon and asphalt additives were at record levels, but those gains were more than offset by lower sales to oilfield drilling and industrial markets. EBITDA margins were 24.9%. Ingevity's initial Form 10 was filed on October 6. We're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.
We're progressing toward our $1 billion in annualized synergy and performance improvements to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018. We generated annualized run rate savings at quarter-end in excess of $150 million, and we expect annualized run rate savings of at least $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016.
We're executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter at 2.08x [ph] leverage, slightly under our stated target leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x.
We completed the SP Fiber acquisition on October 1. The Dublin, Georgia mill is an excellent asset and provides a valuable product mix and adds logistical flexibility within our system. The Newberg, Oregon, newsprint and containerboard machines were idled in our first month of operation due to market conditions in this front and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard mill system. We continue to expect performance improvements in excess of $50 million over 3 years for the transaction to be accretive in the second half of fiscal 2016.
On October 12, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi for our packaging businesses in Mexico. Gondi is a high-quality paperboard manufacturer and packaging converter for many local and global brand-name customers. Our partnership will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexico market. We expect to begin operations as a joint venture as soon as we receive Mexican regulatory approval, which we expect will take 4 to 6 months.
We repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $60.20. We were and continue to be limited in the number of shares we can buy as a result of our need to maintain at least a 50.1% ownership interest by legacy MWV stockholders as of July 1, 2015. This continuity of ownership is necessary to preserve the tax-free separation of the Specialty Chemicals business from WestRock.
We have been and are able to buy back shares up to the exact overlapping investor ownership of our predecessor companies at the specific fund level as of July 1. We have sufficient repurchase opportunity available to us to operate within our target leverage ratio range.
I will now provide more details on our overall results and performance in each business segment before turning it over to Ward, and then I'll come back to provide thoughts on the outlook for our December quarter.
When we compare WestRock's results in the September quarter to the combined recast results in the same quarter of last year, sales declined by $203 million or 5%. This decline was largely comprised of $141 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations and $44 million of revenue from the European tobacco converting business sold earlier in the year.
Adjusted segment EBITDA, net of corporate cost, declined by $80 million compared to last year due to foreign currency translation impact of $26 million, the absence of the $23 million gain we recorded last year due to the write up of spare parts inventory in our mill system, and $26 million in lower pension income. WestRock's credit agreement EBITDA and EBITDA margins over the last 12 months are in excess of $2.5 billion and 16.9%, respectively.
Let's turn to each of our segments.  WestRock's Corrugated Packaging team performed well in the September quarter, especially considering the headwinds we faced in the quarter from a weaker global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales declined by $75 million or 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up by $20 million or 1%. Of the $95 million in currency headwinds, about 1/2 was in Brazil, 1/3 was due to the Canadian dollar and most of the rest was Mexican peso. Segment income was lower by $39 million, with $23 million of that related to the write up of spare parts last year and $15 million related to currency impacts in Canada, Brazil and India.
Overall segment EBITDA margin was 19.4%. Our North American corrugated margin at 20% and our Brazil margin at 28%. As I referenced earlier, our North American box volumes increased by 2.9% compared to last year, and box pricing in North America was stable. Our box system's been very successful in the market by focusing on quality and on-time delivery in combination with innovation that's relevant to our customers' needs. This approach has enabled us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base over time, including gains in the quarter with customers for protein and processed foods, snacks, dairy and e-commerce.
Our success has been and will be defined by how well we operate on a day-to-day basis in each of our plants and with each of our customers. The scale of the WestRock organization has supported our local success to our capital investment, our investment in people and connecting our coworkers so as to make it easier to share knowledge on how to succeed across the company and with our customers. We've continued our volume growth in October by increasing sales on a per day basis by more than 3% over last year.
Our North American corrugated shipments in the quarter declined by 15,000 tons compared to the June quarter and 57,000 tons or 2.7% compared to last year. Export volumes declined by 29,000 tons compared to last year. Our overall export pricing declined $9 per ton compared to the June quarter and $37 per ton compared to last year.  Prices of containerboard to third-party domestic customers have been within a $5 per ton range since the summer of 2014.
We took approximately 76,000 tons of downtime during the quarter, all except 3,000 tons being economic downtime. In October, we took about 95,000 tons of downtime in our corrugated mill system with approximately 55,000 tons being economic downtime, the remainder being maintenance downtime at our Florence mill.
We've consistently operated our system in a way that balances production with our customer demand. We plan and schedule this balance on an ongoing basis and take actions as needed, including slowbacks, economic downtime, maintenance downtime and permanent closures. Our goal is to pursue the actions that we believe will optimize our mill system, thus producing the best economic and operating results for WestRock and our customers.
We don't publicly announce our actions. We communicate our plans to the employees, customers and suppliers, who'll be most directly impacted. This past month is an example of this planning and execution as we took actions at several facilities. With the October 1 completion of the SP Fiber transaction, we were able to reassess our overall mill system to determine the optimal way to meet our customers' demand.
Following this assessment, we announced indefinite downtime at both Fernandina Beach and Uncasville to immediately match our production to customers' orders. The following week, we announced the permanent closure of the 310,000-ton Coshocton, Ohio, mill, which will occur in late November to provide an orderly mill closure and consumption of raw materials, such as chemicals, wood and recovered fiber. The closure of Coshocton will reduce our annual operating cost by $33 million and avoid an additional $4 million annually in maintenance capital expenditures.
The same week, we announced an indefinite idling of our Newberg mill due to the unprofitable nature of the newsprint business and an inadequate order book on containerboard and bag grades. The mill will be idled in mid-November. We retained the optionality on the 2 excellent paper machines at Newberg in the event West Coast demand warrants a restart.
All these actions have been well planned and executed and went according to our expectations. When we take economic downtime, we communicate that it is indefinite because the period of downtime may change with market conditions or lead to a permanent closure.
We will continue to operate our system focused on our customers. Our plans to take -- our plan is to take 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime in our corrugated mills during the December quarter. The Fernandina Beach paper machine has been restarted and the Uncasville mill has been restarted mid-month as planned to meet our customer demand.
We're currently operating with 56,000 tons more inventory than we operated with 1 year ago. This additional inventories helped improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction, with both our internal and external box plant customers, and it's also reduced logistics cost. This benefits far outweigh the carrying cost of increased investment and inventory. Based on our forecasted sales and major maintenance and capital downtime plan, our containerboard inventories will gradually build an additional 30,000 tons from the end of September until they peak in the January-February time frame, then we would expect them to return to our current level over the following few months.
In Brazil, the economic situation continues to be challenging, and our great team in the regions managed to continue to deliver very strong results, including adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.2% and sales growth of 10% on a local currency basis. While industry box demand declined by more than 5%, we grew box volume by 3% year-over-year, with strength in protein, produce and export markets.
In September, our mill in Brazil set new production and shipment records. The interaction between our North American Brazilian corrugated teams has benefited both businesses, so we've been able to drive improved productivity at our mills and box plants.
In 2016, GDP in Brazil is expected to decline by approximately 2%, and industrial production is expected to decline by approximately 6%. Our corrugated business in Brazil is not immune to these challenges. We expect to continue to perform well due to our high-quality assets, customer service and the differentiation of our virgin-based paper and packaging offerings.
In the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall results reflect good commercial and operational execution in the face of some difficult macro headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales in the segment declined $140 million or 8% when compared to last year. This includes $37 million of negative impact from currency. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $14 million lower due to $8 million of foreign exchange impact and $4 million from the sale of the European tobacco business. Segment EBITDA margins were 15.6%.
In the paperboard markets, our SBS food service volumes grew, and our general folding carton and food markets are doing well. Industry SBS backlogs are 393,000 tons, somewhat lower than the 454,000 tons the same time last year. Our backlogs are 3.5 weeks.
We're making very good progress integrating the Carolina brand that we acquired earlier this year. Sales during the quarter were at a rate equivalent to 180,000 tons per year. We expect to fully transition manufacturing to our facilities by the end of December.
One of the first opportunities from the merger was to integrate SBS tons into our folding carton system, and we're already more than halfway to achieving a full annual run rate of 50,000 tons by the end of December. During the quarter, these domestic SBS shipments more than offset softer exports for tobacco and liquid packaging grades.
Industry backlogs for coated recycle board remained strong at approximately 165,000 tons, which is more than 40% higher than this time last year. WestRock CRB backlogs are greater than 4% -- 4 weeks. We are moving production of our millennium board product from our Dallas and Stroudsburg mills to the Mahrt mill. We're backfilling both Dallas and Stroudsburg with additional CRB business.
Demand for CNK remains solid, and our backlogs are nearly 4 weeks. Mill shipments grew by more than 3%, supported by growth from our beverage system. In North America, we largely offset declines in carbonated volumes with gains with our larger brewer customers, continued growth with kraft brewers and gains in the water. In Europe, we saw stronger sales with our larger brewer customers. On the Asia Pacific region, we saw improvement in carbonated soft drinks and dairy packaging.
Our broader folding carton business also performed extremely well. We shared gains in new business in categories such as on-the-go foods, offsetting declines in areas such as cereal. Our general folding carton volumes were up 2% during the quarter, a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year growth. Our operational performance in our carton facilities was also strong with better plant loading and efficiency gains. Our home, health & beauty business improved income and margins due to favorable mix from sales of trigger sprayers and health care dispensing systems as well as productivity gains.
And then our merchandising displays business, we saw a strong rebound with quarterly earnings up 55% over the prior year. After a challenging year that included some sales decline, we're seeing signs of growth and a strengthening market for promotional displays. Our decisions over the last couple of years to strategically invest capital to lower our cost has had a significant positive impact. We've invested in our innovation platform, and that's supporting our growth in new markets, including recently earning awards of new business that helped us in the year on a very positive work. Many of our customers are learning more about our capabilities. We've taken advantage of these opportunities to discuss our full product line and to learn about our customers' objectives, so we can develop paper and packaging solutions that help our customers meet their objectives.
Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform well in the face of the slowdown in drilling and other industrial activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins remained very attractive at 24.9%, even as sales declined by $26 million compared to last year. Ingevity is starting up a new activated carbon plant in China this quarter and expanding our pine chemicals plant in Brazil at the first of the year. The activated carbon plant in China will provide needed capacity for our global system that supports the growing automotive sector.
We're making good progress in qualifying the new production with our automotive customers in Asia and beyond and expect sales to ramp up in the first half of next year.
The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for Specialty Chemicals. This is principally due to the winter slowdown in the road-paving activity. We expect continued challenges in the oilfield sector, which impacts the segment sales levels and margins.
I'm very pleased that both Michael Wilson and John Fortson have joined Ingevity as CEO and CFO, respectively. They both bring tremendous and highly relevant experience to the business. We have confidence in their ability to lead Ingevity through these challenges and to a period of growth as an independent company. The spin off of Ingevity is moving forward. The initial Form 10 was filed, and we're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016 spin date.
The Land and Development business continues to make good progress on their major projects in the Charleston region. The business had a fantastic quarter from a revenue standpoint with $45 million in revenue, including a $34 million gain related to the 68 -- I mean, the sale for $34 million related to the 6,800-acre site that Volvo acquired to build their new U.S. manufacturing facility.
But due to the impact of purchase price accounting, we're revaluing their existing projects to fair value, they lost $3 million on a GAAP basis. The step up in book value had a $15 million negative impact on segment income in the quarter. This marking to fair market value of our land portfolio in this business will reduce future profitability on existing projects, but it does not impact future cash flows.
As part of the valuation work, we have developed a project-by-project valuation of the partnership, which, for our share, is over $400 million. The experienced team in this business is executing on the plan to maximize this potential value. We're considering ways to monetize that value at a faster pace.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward Dickson. Ward?"

Productivity and synergies drove $60 million in earnings improvement. FX was a negative $26 million headwind, which -- with much of that in Europe and Brazil. And the total impact of inflation of labor and commodities for the segments and corporate was $20 million. The change in labor and benefits was approximately $29 million, and there was $9 million of combined deflation in commodity and other cost categories.
The total impact of price and mix changes was minimal in the quarter. Corrugated Packaging had positive price/mix variance in due -- in part due to stable domestic box pricing, higher prices in Brazil, lower volumes of exports and domestic tons shipped and an increase in the higher-margin box shipments. There was some decline in price and mix in the Consumer Packaging grades and Specialty Chemicals.
Noncash pension income was $26 million lower than last year due to, among other things, lower return on asset assumptions as we derisked our pension plans; the nonrecurring amount of $29 million includes $23 million from last year's spare parts gains that didn't recur this year.
We made significant progress during our first quarter as WestRock toward our $1 billion synergy and productivity improvement target. We entered the quarter at a run rate of $75 million in savings and exited at an annualized run rate in excess of $150 million, which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. This is a significant objective that will take a lot of work over the next 3 years to capture.
Our entire organization is focused on meeting these objectives, and we have consistent monitoring and processes in place to make sure we stay on track, so we are confident in our ability to reach $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. We estimate that we will be at an annualized run rate of at least $400 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016.
Our total SG&A costs for the quarter were $429 million or 11% of sales. However, this total includes $64 million in ongoing merger and acquisition-related intangible amortization cost that flow through the $281 million depreciation and amortization line on our cash flow. Excluding intangible amortization, our SG&A costs are running at 9.4% of sales and will trend lower as we execute on our synergy and performance improvement program.
We have completed our work to allocate corporate cost to the appropriate business units, all the way down to the costs in our level. The full cost allocation brings further visibility into spending and business unit profitability. When comparing legacy RockTenn and MWV, approximately 70% of RockTenn's corporate costs were allocated to the business units, and MWV was approximately 30% allocated.
There was also some geography changes in the allocation work as some legacy MWV manufacturing site costs for nonproduction activities in the amount of $18 million removed from cost of goods sold to SG&A. And as Steve said, we have included Slide 19 that provides a reconciliation of reported to recast segment income and EBITDA for Q4 FY '14 for comparability purposes.
We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in reported debt. And included in that figure is approximately $340 million in fair value step-up to the market value of the legacy MWV debt. The notional amount of what we owe under our debt obligations are approximately $5.3 billion.
Our balance sheet is in great shape as we have $3.4 billion in available liquidity to support our strategy and very few maturities over the next several years. Our leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.08x.
Our pension plans are in great shape, and we ended the fiscal year with almost $400 million in combined GAAP-funded status surplus in our qualified U.S. and Canadian pension plans. The U.S. plans were overfunded by more than $500 million, and the Canadian plans were underfunded by more than $100 million. The overfunding in the U.S. plans gives us options as we think about derisking our balance sheet.
Slide #13 has a number of key financial items to help in modeling our performance. Depreciation and amortization will continue to be approximately $285 million on a quarterly basis. And of that total, intangibles amortization is approximately $70 million.
Our CapEx is still estimated at $850 million for the full year. The pension income of $8 million represents both the qualified and nonqualified planned amounts. Our books -- our book tax rate should be in the range of 33% to 35% for the December quarter. The September quarter effective tax rate of 29% was lower than our forecast due to discrete items, primarily at the state tax level.  We are planning scheduled maintenance downtime within our corrugated mill system of 114,000 tons during the quarter.
Other items incorporated in our tax position also included $21.5 million of nontax deductible restructuring piece. Cash pension contributions into our qualified pension plans are approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016, with almost all of that going into our Canadian plans. Our nonqualified ERISA plans will require additional cash funding of approximately $13 million this fiscal year. We have $115 million in state federal and foreign NOLs and $213 million in AMT and other federal credits.
And now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Looking to the immediate future, there's a number of items that will impact our performance in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We'll see benefits from our performance improvement initiatives. Our domestic box and folding carton businesses continue to do well as compared to the market.
Energy prices are lower, which is a positive for us. There's 3 less shipping days this quarter, and the December quarter historically has lower seasonal sales volumes than the September quarter. Maintenance and economic downtime will have a negative earnings impact. The euro and Brazilian real have both softened from September averages, and we expect return to normal tax rates. Considering all of these items in the quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be lower in the December quarter as compared to last quarter.
Looking further out, WestRock aspires to be the global leader in corrugated and consumer packaging. The first step for WestRock to achieve this aspiration is to combine and integrate our organizations and in the process, capture $1 billion in merger-related efficiencies and productivity improvements. We're on the road to capture this opportunity over the next 3 years.
We've made a lot of progress in our business in just 4 months. We've made progress building our culture at WestRock, progress making our operations more efficient and, more importantly, progress teaming with our packaging customers to grow their share in the marketplace. While paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, the global economy, a strong U.S. dollar, intense competition challenges across our businesses. We're responding to these challenges with urgency, both to deliver short-term results but also to keep our eye on the long-term opportunity we have within our sights. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that are ahead of us and believe we're making excellent progress in the long-term value creation opportunities we have as WestRock.

So we were able to immediately take some capacity -- production capacity out with the indefinite idling of the Fernandina Beach paper machine 3 and the Uncasville facilities, followed quickly by the announcement of the permanent closure of the Coshocton mill, which takes some time to properly close in order to provide an orderly shutdown and to optimally consume chemicals, raw materials, fiber, wood, et cetera.

It's been a better commercial strategy targeting more attractive niches in the global market, better plant loadings and better productivity. And we have made incremental investments in that business that are required to support our customers, our partners with their particular rollouts. So it's all working together and continues to show a very positive trend. In terms of the fit question, we like it for 3 reasons. One is the overlap that the home, health & beauty dispensing system business has with our other paper and packaging businesses. Roughly $1 million -- $1 billion of WestRock sales are to customers that buy dispenser products and other paperboard and packaging products from WestRock. We also have really strong relationships with these customers through the dispensing system business, because it's a highly technical and innovative business, and so these are more like partnerships, which, then, we can leverage with our other packaging businesses.

And it's great that it's a merger, because one of the big issues we had in Smurfit, I'm going to put into the category of culture, that we were integrating into our organization. At the time, I was CFO. My job tripled overnight, and then, the Smurfit organization had not as been successful over a long period of time. And that is -- continues to be a lesson for me of how that can really impact a culture. This merger is very much different. Because I think most of the people on the call would have known of both companies, and WestRock's bringing the best of both companies to the table. We're highly complementary. I think you could pro forma either company, and I guess, we are trying to pro forma both companies going forward. And we've got a tremendous future together, which is better than either company would have on its own. So depending on what side you're on, we can go through, enumerate the opportunities. But we effectively -- from a culture standpoint, we've put a much greater emphasis on that. And so we are moving beyond this is a merger of 2 companies, but it's a creation of a new company, which is WestRock, and we're working together. I'm very optimistic about the future of the company. And I think on -- in the call, I think we focused a lot on a very discrete set of actions we took, which, I think, were misinterpreted by the business. But underlying that, I think we're performing at an exceptional outcome, that we're delivering the merger and performance improvements. Somebody asked about is there -- was there a surprise? And I would like to think that there's an expectation we're going to go out and get that. But we are meeting that expectation, I'd say, with enthusiasm across the organization. And that's going to end up -- what we need to do that to be successful. While all that is going on, we have, I think, each one of our businesses on a day-to-day basis is operating exceptionally well. I'm very excited about the reaction we're getting from the customers. They're coming to us and asking us what can -- what's this about, and we're having a conversation, which is a little bit early to tell what the ultimate tale of the tape is, but I think it's going to position us to be a remarkably successful company going forward.

I think, as you know, having all of the business, the Specialty Chemical business that will become Ingevity, is a highly flexible business around its refinery system. And oilfield technologies has definitely seen the impact of what's happening in the broader sector. But let me give you a couple of statistics to put it into perspective. So well counts -- oil well counts are down about 65% across the industry year-on-year, yet our revenue in that specific sector is only down about 40%. So we're actually taking share in the downmarket in oilfield, which is a market that we really like for its profitability. And that's because we just have really great, highly differentiated products. And at the same time, we're able to shift business over to the industrial specialties. Yes, there's been some pricing movement with the dislocations that are occurring, very modest offset in volume. But as I said earlier in one of my answers, we're able to move into some other areas that help offset that volume decline. And asphalt pavement technologies has been an example of that, up 19% versus prior year. So a lot of big movements in the business, but really great effort by the team in managing through what's been a fairly volatile period of time. And I think it'll position them well for the future.

This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. Thanks for taking the time to listen to our call today. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
We're looking forward to sharing our results for the September quarter of 2015, which is the first quarter for which we're reporting the results of WestRock.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These include our WestRock S-4 filing, the most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, the recent Form 10 filed to enable the tax-free spin spend of our Specialty Chemicals business.
We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You may have noticed in our press release and on Page 19 of our earnings call deck that we've provided a comparison of our results for the September quarter of 2015 to the September quarter of 2014. This comparison uses the reported results of predecessor companies as adjusted for our new segment and other merger-related accounting items, including application of a consistent method for allocating corporate cost. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation that's available on our website.
We've performed well in our first quarter of operations as WestRock. The most appropriate place for me to start is by thanking all of my WestRock coworkers who have continued to take care of our customers, operate safely and deliver strong results in a competitive business environment. All are working extremely hard to take advantage of the many opportunities that we have in the newly merged company. We continue to have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets.
We're making significant strides in areas that are driving value from the merger, including the integration of our organizations, the realization of the merger-related synergies and performance improvements, and the opportunities we have to provide a broad range of paper and packaging solutions to help our customers succeed in their markets.
We reported $0.93 of adjusted earnings per share and generated $268 million of free cash flow after adding back the after-tax cost of transaction fees and restructuring cost.
We executed exceptionally well in our packaging businesses. Our North American box business increased volumes by 2.9% on a per-day basis in the quarter. This compares to a less than 1% increase for the industry over the same time frame. Our containerboard mill system is operating efficiently. The North American Corrugated Packaging business earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%. The Corrugated Packaging business in Brazil is operating exceptionally well and earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% in the September quarter.
Our consumer mill system is also operating well, and we're implementing published price increases across the recycled grades. There's positive momentum in folding carton; home, health & beauty; merchandising displays, and I'll have more color on each of those shortly.
Specialty Chemicals sales of activated carbon and asphalt additives were at record levels, but those gains were more than offset by lower sales to oilfield drilling and industrial markets. EBITDA margins were 24.9%. Ingevity's initial Form 10 was filed on October 6. We're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.
We're progressing toward our $1 billion in annualized synergy and performance improvements to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018. We generated annualized run rate savings at quarter-end in excess of $150 million, and we expect annualized run rate savings of at least $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016.
We're executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter at 2.08x leverage, slightly under our stated target leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x.
We completed the SP Fiber acquisition on October 1. The Dublin, Georgia mill is an excellent asset and provides a valuable product mix and adds logistical flexibility within our system. The Newberg, Oregon, newsprint and containerboard machines were idled in our first month of operation due to market conditions in newsprint and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard mill system. We continue to expect performance improvements in excess of $50 million over 3 years for the transaction to be accretive in the second half of fiscal 2016.
On October 12, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi for our packaging businesses in Mexico. Gondi is a high-quality paperboard manufacturer and packaging converter for many local and global brand-name customers. Our partnership will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexico market. We expect to begin operations as a joint venture as soon as we receive Mexican regulatory approval, which we expect will take 4 to 6 months.
We repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $60.20. We were and continue to be limited in the number of shares we can buy as a result of our need to maintain at least a 50.1% ownership interest by legacy MWV stockholders as of July 1, 2015. This continuity of ownership is necessary to preserve the tax-free separation of the Specialty Chemicals business from WestRock.
We have been and are able to buy back shares up to the exact overlapping investor ownership of our predecessor companies at the specific fund level as of July 1. We have sufficient repurchase opportunity available to us to operate within our target leverage ratio range.
I will now provide more details on our overall results and performance in each business segment before turning it over to Ward, and then I'll come back to provide thoughts on the outlook for our December quarter.
When we compare WestRock's results in the September quarter to the combined recast results in the same quarter of last year, sales declined by $203 million or 5%. This decline was largely comprised of $141 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations and $44 million of revenue from the European tobacco converting business sold earlier in the year.
Adjusted segment EBITDA, net of corporate cost, declined by $80 million compared to last year, due to foreign currency translation impacts of $26 million, the absence of the $23 million gain we recorded last year due to the write up of spare parts inventory in our mill system, and $26 million in lower pension income. WestRock's credit agreement EBITDA and EBITDA margins over the last 12 months are in excess of $2.5 billion and 16.9%, respectively.
Let's turn to each of our segments.  WestRock's Corrugated Packaging team performed well in the September quarter, especially considering the headwinds we faced in the quarter from a weaker global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales declined by $75 million or 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up by $20 million or 1%. Of the $95 million in currency headwinds, about 1/2 was in Brazil, 1/3 was due to the Canadian dollar and most of the rest was the Mexican peso. Segment income was lower by $39 million, with $23 million of that related to the write-up of spare parts last year and $15 million related to currency impacts in Canada, Brazil and India.
Overall segment EBITDA margin was 19.4%, with our North American Corrugated margin at 20% and our Brazil margin at 28%. As I referenced earlier, our North American box volumes increased by 2.9% compared to last year, and box pricing in North America was stable. Our box system's been very successful in the market by focusing on quality and on-time delivery in combination with innovation that's relevant to our customers' needs. This approach has enabled us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base over time, including gains in the quarter with customers for protein and processed foods, snacks, dairy and e-commerce.
Our success has been and will be defined by how well we operate on a day-to-day basis in each of our plants and with each of our customers. The scale of the WestRock organization has supported our local success through our capital investment, our investment in people and connecting our coworkers so as to make it easier to share knowledge on how to succeed across the company and with our customers. We've continued our volume growth in October by increasing sales on a per-day basis by more than 3% over last year.
Our North American corrugated shipments in the quarter declined by 15,000 tons compared to the June quarter and 57,000 tons or 2.7% compared to last year. Export volumes declined by 29,000 tons compared to last year. Our overall export pricing declined $9 per ton compared to the June quarter and $37 per ton compared to last year.  Prices of containerboard to third-party domestic customers have been within a $5-per-ton range since the summer of 2014.
We took approximately 76,000 tons of downtime during the quarter, all except 3,000 tons being economic downtime. In October, we took about 95,000 tons of downtime in our corrugated mill system with approximately 55,000 tons being economic downtime, the remainder being maintenance downtime at our Florence mill.
We've consistently operated our system in a way that balances production with our customer demand. We plan and schedule this balance on an ongoing basis and take actions as needed, including slowbacks, economic downtime, maintenance downtime and permanent closures. Our goal is to pursue the actions that we believe will optimize our mill system, thus producing the best economic and operating results for WestRock and our customers.
We don't publicly announce our actions. We communicate our plans to the employees, customers and suppliers who'll be most directly impacted. This past month is an example of this planning and execution as we took actions at several facilities. With the October 1 completion of the SP Fiber transaction, we were able to reassess our overall mill system to determine the optimal way to meet our customers' demand.
Following this assessment, we announced indefinite downtime at both Fernandina Beach and Uncasville to immediately match our production to customers' orders. The following week, we announced the permanent closure of the 310,000-ton Coshocton, Ohio, mill, which will occur in late November to provide an orderly mill closure and consumption of raw materials, such as chemicals, wood and recovered fiber. The closure of Coshocton will reduce our annual operating cost by $33 million and avoid an additional $4 million annually in maintenance capital expenditures.
The same week, we announced an indefinite idling of our Newberg mill due to the unprofitable nature of the newsprint business and an inadequate order book on containerboard and bag grades. The mill will be idled in mid-November. We retained the optionality on the 2 excellent paper machines at Newberg in the event West Coast demand warrants a restart.
All these actions have been well planned and executed and went according to our expectations. When we take economic downtime, we communicate that it is indefinite because the period of downtime may change with market conditions or lead to a permanent closure.
We will continue to operate our system focused on our customers. Our plans to take -- our plan is to take 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime in our corrugated mills during the December quarter. The Fernandina Beach paper machine has been restarted and the Uncasville mill is being restarted mid-month, as planned, to meet our customer demand.
We're currently operating with 56,000 tons more inventory than we operated with 1 year ago. This additional inventory has helped improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction with both our internal and external box plant customers, and it's also reduced logistics cost. These benefits far outweigh the carrying cost of increased investment in inventory. Based on our forecasted sales and major maintenance and capital downtime plan, our containerboard inventories will gradually build an additional 30,000 tons from the end of September until they peak in the January-February time frame, then we would expect them to return to our current level over the following few months.
In Brazil, the economic situation continues to be challenging, and our great team in the regions managed to continue to deliver very strong results, including adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.2% and sales growth of 10% on a local currency basis. While industry box demand declined by more than 5%, we grew box volume by 3% year-over-year, with strength in protein, produce and export markets.
In September, our mill in Brazil set new production and shipment records. The interaction between our North American and Brazilian corrugated teams has benefited both businesses, so we've been able to drive improved productivity at our mills and box plants.
In 2016, GDP in Brazil is expected to decline by approximately 2%, and industrial production is expected to decline by approximately 6%. While our corrugated business in Brazil is not immune to these challenges, we expect to continue to perform well due to our high-quality assets, customer service and the differentiation of our virgin-based paper and packaging offerings.
In the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall results reflect good commercial and operational execution in the face of some difficult macro headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales in the segment declined $140 million or 8% when compared to last year. This includes $37 million of negative impact from currency. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $14 million lower due to $8 million of foreign exchange impact and $4 million from the sale of the European tobacco business. Segment EBITDA margins were 15.6%.
In the paperboard markets, our SBS food service volumes grew, and our general folding carton and food markets are doing well. Industry SBS backlogs are 393,000 tons, somewhat lower than the 454,000 tons the same time last year. Our backlogs are 3.5 weeks.
We're making very good progress integrating the Carolina brand that we acquired earlier this year. Sales during the quarter were at a rate equivalent to 180,000 tons per year. We expect to fully transition manufacturing to our facilities by the end of December.
One of the first opportunities from the merger was to integrate SBS tons into our folding carton system, and we're already more than halfway to achieving a full annual run rate of 50,000 tons by the end of December. During the quarter, these domestic SBS shipments more than offset softer exports for tobacco and liquid packaging grades.
Industry backlogs for coated recycle board remained strong at approximately 165,000 tons, which is more than 40% higher than this time last year. WestRock CRB backlogs are greater than 4% -- 4 weeks. We are moving production of our Millennium board product from our Dallas and Stroudsburg mills to the Mahrt mill. We're backfilling both Dallas and Stroudsburg with additional CRB business.
Demand for CNK remains solid, and our backlogs are nearly 4 weeks. Mill shipments grew by more than 3%, supported by growth from our beverage system. In North America, we largely offset declines in carbonated volumes with gains with our larger brewer customers, continued growth with craft brewers and gains in water. In Europe, we saw stronger sales with our larger brewer customers. On the Asia Pacific region, we saw improvement in carbonated soft drinks and dairy packaging.
Our broader folding carton business also performed extremely well, with share gains and new business in categories such as on-the-go foods offsetting declines in areas such as cereal. Our general folding carton volumes were up 2% during the quarter, a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year growth. Our operational performance in our carton facilities was also strong with better plant loading and efficiency gains. Our home, health & beauty business improved income and margins due to favorable mix from sales of trigger sprayers and health care dispensing systems as well as productivity gains.
And in our merchandising displays business, we saw a strong rebound with quarterly earnings up 55% over the prior year. After a challenging year that included some sales decline, we're seeing signs of growth and a strengthening market for promotional displays. Our decisions over the last couple of years to strategically invest capital to lower our cost has had a significant positive impact. We've invested in our innovation platform, and that's supporting our growth in new markets, including recently earning awards of new business that helped us end the year on a very positive note. Many of our customers are learning more about our capabilities. We've taken advantage of these opportunities to discuss our full product line and to learn about our customers' objectives so we can develop paper and packaging solutions that help our customers meet their objectives.
Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform well in the face of the slowdown in drilling and other industrial activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins remained very attractive at 24.9%, even as sales declined by $26 million compared to last year. Ingevity is starting up a new activated carbon plant in China this quarter and expanding our pine chemicals plant in Brazil at the first of the year. The activated carbon plant in China will provide needed capacity for our global system that supports the growing automotive sector.
We're making good progress in qualifying the new production with our automotive customers in Asia and beyond and expect sales to ramp up in the first half of next year.
The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for Specialty Chemicals. This is principally due to the winter slowdown in the road-paving activity. We expect continued challenges in the oilfield sector, which impacts the segment sales levels and margins.
I'm very pleased that both Michael Wilson and John Fortson have joined Ingevity as CEO and CFO, respectively. They both bring tremendous and highly relevant experience to the business. We have confidence in their ability to lead Ingevity through these challenges and to a period of growth as an independent company. The spin-off of Ingevity is moving forward. The initial Form 10 was filed, and we're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.
The Land and Development business continues to make good progress on their major projects in the Charleston region. The business had a fantastic quarter from a revenue standpoint with $45 million in revenue, including a $34 million gain related to the 68 -- I mean, the sale for $34 million related to the 6,800-acre site that Volvo acquired to build their new U.S. manufacturing facility.
But due to the impact of purchase price accounting and revaluing their existing projects to fair value, they lost $3 million on a GAAP basis. The step-up in book value had a $15 million negative impact on segment income in the quarter. This marking to fair market value of our land portfolio in this business will reduce future profitability on existing projects, but it does not impact future cash flows.
As part of the valuation work, we have developed a project-by-project valuation of the partnership, which, for our share, is over $400 million. The experienced team in this business is executing on the plan to maximize this potential value. We're considering ways to monetize that value at a faster pace.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward Dickson. Ward?"

Looking at our segment EBITDA, the productivity initiatives we have in place are working to offset inflation and FX. Productivity and synergies drove $60 million in earnings improvement.

Productivity and synergies drove $60 million in earnings improvement. FX was a negative $26 million headwind, which -- with much of that in Europe and Brazil. And the total impact of inflation of labor and commodities for the segments and corporate was $20 million. The change in labor and benefits was approximately $29 million, and there was $9 million of combined deflation in commodity and other cost categories.
The total impact of price and mix changes was minimal in the quarter. Corrugated Packaging had positive price/mix variance in due -- in part due to stable domestic box pricing, higher prices in Brazil, lower volumes of exports and domestic tons shipped, and an increase in the higher-margin box shipments. There was some decline in price and mix in the Consumer Packaging grades and Specialty Chemicals.
Noncash pension income was $26 million lower than last year due to, among other things, lower return on asset assumptions as we derisked our pension plans. The nonrecurring amount of $29 million includes $23 million from last year's spare parts gains that didn't recur this year.
We made significant progress during our first quarter as WestRock toward our $1 billion synergy and productivity improvement target. We entered the quarter at a run rate of $75 million in savings and exited at an annualized run rate in excess of $150 million, which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. This is a significant objective that will take a lot of work over the next 3 years to capture.
Our entire organization is focused on meeting these objectives, and we have consistent monitoring and processes in place to make sure we stay on track so we are confident in our ability to reach $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. We estimate that we will be at an annualized run rate of at least $400 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016.
Our total SG&A costs for the quarter were $429 million or 11% of sales. However, this total includes $64 million in ongoing merger and acquisition-related intangible amortization cost that flow through the $281 million depreciation and amortization line on our cash flow. Excluding intangible amortization, our SG&A costs are running at 9.4% of sales and will trend lower as we execute on our synergy and performance improvement program.
We have completed our work to allocate corporate cost to the appropriate business units, all the way down to the costs in our level. The full cost allocation brings further visibility into spending and business unit profitability. When comparing legacy RockTenn and MWV, approximately 70% of RockTenn's corporate costs were allocated to the business units, and MWV was approximately 30% allocated.
There was also some geography changes in the allocation work as some legacy MWV manufacturing site costs for nonproduction activities in the amount of $18 million were moved from cost of goods sold to SG&A. And as Steve said, we have included Slide 19 that provides a reconciliation of reported-to-recast segment income and EBITDA for Q4 FY '14 for comparability purposes.
We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in reported debt. And included in that figure is approximately $340 million in fair value step-up to the market value of the legacy MWV debt. The notional amount of what we owe under our debt obligations are approximately $5.3 billion.
Our balance sheet is in great shape as we have $3.4 billion in available liquidity to support our strategy and very few maturities over the next several years. Our leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.08x.
Our pension plans are in great shape, and we ended the fiscal year with almost $400 million in combined GAAP-funded status surplus in our qualified U.S. and Canadian pension plans. The U.S. plans were overfunded by more than $500 million, and the Canadian plans were underfunded by more than $100 million. The overfunding in the U.S. plans gives us options as we think about derisking our balance sheet.
Slide #13 has a number of key financial items to help in modeling our performance. Depreciation and amortization will continue to be approximately $285 million on a quarterly basis. And of that total, intangibles amortization is approximately $70 million.
Our CapEx is still estimated at $850 million for the full year. The pension income of $8 million represents both the qualified and nonqualified plan amounts. Our books -- our book tax rate should be in the range of 33% to 35% for the December quarter. The September quarter effective tax rate of 29% was lower than our forecast due to discrete items, primarily at the state tax level.  We are planning scheduled maintenance downtime within our corrugated mill system of 114,000 tons during the quarter.
Other items incorporated in our tax position also included $21.5 million of nontax-deductible restructuring piece. Cash pension contributions into our qualified pension plans are approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016, with almost all of that going into our Canadian plans. Our nonqualified or SERP plans will require additional cash funding of approximately $13 million this fiscal year. We have $115 million in state, federal and foreign NOLs and $213 million in AMT and other federal credits.
And now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Looking to the immediate future, there's a number of items that will impact our performance in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We'll see benefits from our performance improvement initiatives. Our domestic box and folding carton businesses continue to do well as compared to the market.
Energy prices are lower, which is a positive for us. There's 3 less shipping days this quarter, and the December quarter historically has lower seasonal sales volumes than the September quarter. Maintenance and economic downtime will have a negative earnings impact. The euro and Brazilian real have both softened from September averages, and we expect return to normal tax rates. Considering all of these items in the quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be lower in the December quarter as compared to last quarter.
Looking further out, WestRock aspires to be the global leader in corrugated and consumer packaging. The first step for WestRock to achieve this aspiration is to combine and integrate our organizations and in the process, capture $1 billion in merger-related efficiencies and productivity improvements. We're on the road to capture this opportunity over the next 3 years.
We've made a lot of progress in our business in just 4 months. We've made progress building our culture at WestRock, progress making our operations more efficient and, more importantly, progress teaming with our packaging customers to grow their share in the marketplace. While paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, the global economy, a strong U.S. dollar and intense competition challenge us across our businesses. We're responding to these challenges with urgency, both to deliver short-term results but also to keep our eye on the long-term opportunity we have within our sights. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that are ahead of us and believe we're making excellent progress in the long-term value creation opportunities we have as WestRock.

And so we're constantly in a situation of designing the optimal portfolio of production capacity to meet that demand. And with the addition of the SP Fiber acquisition, which we were delighted to close October 1, gave us the opportunity to really reassess our containerboard system and to make some important moves, utilizing those excellent assets at Dublin to better optimize our supply capability to our customers and improve our cost structure. So we were able to immediately take some capacity -- production capacity out with the indefinite idling of the Fernandina Beach paper machine 3 and the Uncasville facilities, followed quickly by the announcement of the permanent closure of the Coshocton mill, which takes some time to properly close in order to provide an orderly shutdown and to optimally consume chemicals, raw materials, fiber, wood, et cetera. And we also then followed that same week with the indefinite idling of the Newberg facility because of the weakness of the newsprint markets and to, again, balance our supply-demand scenario. So all of those decisions were executed to improve our capability to serve our customers and to improve our cost structure. We now are able to bring back the Fernandina Beach facility, which is an excellent paper machine producing high-quality, virgin containerboard for our domestic and international markets, and the Uncasville recycled mill will also return. So that's -- we operated that balancing in a way that supported our customers well and improved our cost structure. And that's the types of activities you'll see us focusing on in the future."

Steve mentioned in his prepared comments, it had a terrific quarter, and they continue to build on this track record of improvement that you have seen in the business over the last 2 years now, which has come from a combination of things. It's been a better commercial strategy targeting more attractive niches in the global market, better plant loadings and better productivity. And we have made incremental investments in that business that are required to support our customers, our partners with their particular rollouts. So it's all working together and continues to show a very positive trend. In terms of the fit question, we like it for 3 reasons. One is the overlap that the home, health & beauty dispensing system business has with our other paper and packaging businesses. Roughly $1 million -- $1 billion of WestRock sales are to customers that buy dispenser products and other paperboard and packaging products from WestRock. We also have really strong relationships with these customers through the dispensing system business, because it's a highly technical and innovative business, and so these are more like partnerships, which, then, we can leverage with our other packaging businesses. And then finally, it's a global business, which gives us the opportunity to reach beyond the North American borders. So we still feel very good about the fit and the performance of that business."

I think, yes, we are, but they're very different situations. So Smurfit was literally an acquisition. This is a merger. And it's great that it's a merger, because one of the big issues we had in Smurfit, I'm going to put into the category of culture, that we were integrating into our organization. At the time, I was CFO. My job tripled overnight, and then, the Smurfit organization had not just been successful over a long period of time. And that is -- continues to be a lesson for me of how that can really impact a culture. This merger is very much different. Because I think most of the people on the call would have known of both companies, and WestRock's bringing the best of both companies to the table. We're highly complementary. I think you could pro forma either company, and I guess, we are trying to pro forma both companies going forward. And we've got a tremendous future together, which is better than either company would have on its own. So depending on what side you're on, we can go through -- enumerate the opportunities. But we effectively -- from a culture standpoint, we've put a much greater emphasis on that. And so we are moving beyond -- this is a merger of 2 companies, but it's a creation of a new company, which is WestRock, and we're working together. I'm very optimistic about the future of the company. And I think on -- in the call, I think we focused a lot on a very discrete set of actions we took, which, I think, were misinterpreted by the business. But underlying that, I think we're performing at an exceptional level, that we're delivering the merger and performance improvements. Somebody asked about is there -- was there a surprise? And I would like to think that there's an expectation we're going to go out and get that. But we are meeting that expectation, I'd say, with enthusiasm across the organization. And that's going to end up -- what we need to do that to be successful. While all that is going on, we have -- I think each one of our businesses on a day-to-day basis is operating exceptionally well. I'm very excited about the reaction we're getting from the customers. They're coming to us and asking us what can -- what's this about, and we're having a conversation, which is a little bit early to tell what the ultimate tale of the tape is, but I think it's going to position us to be a remarkably successful company going forward.

Let me start with Specialty Chemicals, and then we can come back to Consumer Packaging. I think, as you know, having all of the business, the Specialty Chemical business that will become Ingevity, is a highly flexible business around its refinery system. And oilfield technologies has definitely seen the impact of what's happening in the broader sector. But let me give you a couple of statistics to put it into perspective. So well counts -- oil well counts are down about 65% across the industry year-on-year, yet our revenue in that specific sector is only down about 40%. So we're actually taking share in the downmarket in oilfield, which is a market that we really like for its profitability. And that's because we just have really great, highly differentiated products. And at the same time, we're able to shift business over to the industrial specialties. Yes, there's been some pricing movement with the dislocations that are occurring, very modest offset in volume. But as I said earlier in one of my answers, we're able to move into some other areas that help offset that volume decline. And asphalt pavement technologies has been an example of that, up 19% versus prior year. So a lot of big movements in the business, but really great effort by the team in managing through what's been a fairly volatile period of time. And I think it'll position them well for the future.

This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. Thanks for taking the time to listen to our call today. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.
We're looking forward to sharing our results for the September quarter of 2015, which is the first quarter for which we're reporting the results of WestRock.
During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These include our WestRock S-4 filing, the most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed by our predecessor companies, the recent Form 10 filed to enable the tax-free spin of our Specialty Chemicals business.
We'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You may have noticed in our press release and on Page 19 of our earnings call deck that we've provided a comparison of our results for the September quarter of 2015 to the September quarter of 2014. This comparison uses the reported results of predecessor companies as adjusted for our new segment and other merger-related accounting items, including application of a consistent method for allocating corporate cost. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation that's available on our website.
We've performed well in our first quarter of operations as WestRock. The most appropriate place for me to start is by thanking all of my WestRock coworkers who have continued to take care of our customers, operate safely and deliver strong results in a competitive business environment. All are working extremely hard to take advantage of the many opportunities that we have in the newly merged company. We continue to have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets.
We're making significant strides in areas that are driving value from the merger, including the integration of our organizations, the realization of the merger-related synergies and performance improvements, and the opportunities we have to provide a broad range of paper and packaging solutions to help our customers succeed in their markets.
We reported $0.93 of adjusted earnings per share and generated $268 million of free cash flow after adding back the after-tax cost of transaction fees and restructuring cost.
We executed exceptionally well in our packaging businesses. Our North American box business increased volumes by 2.9% on a per-day basis in the quarter. This compares to a less than 1% increase for the industry over the same time frame. Our containerboard mill system is operating efficiently. The North American Corrugated Packaging business earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%. The Corrugated Packaging business in Brazil is operating exceptionally well and earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% in the September quarter.
Our consumer mill system is also operating well, and we're implementing published price increases across the recycled grades. There's positive momentum in folding carton; home, health & beauty; merchandising displays, and I'll have more color on each of those shortly.
Specialty Chemicals sales of activated carbon and asphalt additives were at record levels, but those gains were more than offset by lower sales to oilfield drilling and industrial markets. EBITDA margins were 24.9%. Ingevity's initial Form 10 was filed on October 6. We're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.
We're progressing toward our $1 billion in annualized synergy and performance improvements to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018. We generated annualized run rate savings at quarter-end in excess of $150 million, and we expect annualized run rate savings of at least $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016.
We're executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter at 2.08x leverage, slightly under our stated target leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x.
We completed the SP Fiber acquisition on October 1. The Dublin, Georgia mill is an excellent asset and provides a valuable product mix and adds logistical flexibility within our system. The Newberg, Oregon, newsprint and containerboard machines were idled in our first month of operation due to market conditions in newsprint and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard mill system. We continue to expect performance improvements in excess of $50 million over 3 years for the transaction to be accretive in the second half of fiscal 2016.
On October 12, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi for our packaging businesses in Mexico. Gondi is a high-quality paperboard manufacturer and packaging converter for many local and global brand-name customers. Our partnership will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexico market. We expect to begin operations as a joint venture as soon as we receive Mexican regulatory approval, which we expect will take 4 to 6 months.
We repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $60.20. We were and continue to be limited in the number of shares we can buy as a result of our need to maintain at least a 50.1% ownership interest by legacy MWV stockholders as of July 1, 2015. This continuity of ownership is necessary to preserve the tax-free separation of the Specialty Chemicals business from WestRock.
We have been and are able to buy back shares up to the exact overlapping investor ownership of our predecessor companies at the specific fund level as of July 1. We have sufficient repurchase opportunity available to us to operate within our target leverage ratio range.
I will now provide more details on our overall results and performance in each business segment before turning it over to Ward, and then I'll come back to provide thoughts on the outlook for our December quarter.
When we compare WestRock's results in the September quarter to the combined recast results in the same quarter of last year, sales declined by $203 million or 5%. This decline was largely comprised of $141 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations and $44 million of revenue from the European tobacco converting business sold earlier in the year.
Adjusted segment EBITDA, net of corporate cost, declined by $80 million compared to last year, due to foreign currency translation impacts of $26 million, the absence of the $23 million gain we recorded last year due to the write up of spare parts inventory in our mill system, and $26 million in lower pension income. WestRock's credit agreement EBITDA and EBITDA margins over the last 12 months are in excess of $2.5 billion and 16.9%, respectively.
Let's turn to each of our segments.  WestRock's Corrugated Packaging team performed well in the September quarter, especially considering the headwinds we faced in the quarter from a weaker global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales declined by $75 million or 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up by $20 million or 1%. Of the $95 million in currency headwinds, about 1/2 was in Brazil, 1/3 was due to the Canadian dollar and most of the rest was the Mexican peso. Segment income was lower by $39 million, with $23 million of that related to the write-up of spare parts last year and $15 million related to currency impacts in Canada, Brazil and India.
Overall segment EBITDA margin was 19.4%, with our North American Corrugated margin at 20% and our Brazil margin at 28%. As I referenced earlier, our North American box volumes increased by 2.9% compared to last year, and box pricing in North America was stable. Our box system's been very successful in the market by focusing on quality and on-time delivery in combination with innovation that's relevant to our customers' needs. This approach has enabled us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base over time, including gains in the quarter with customers for protein and processed foods, snacks, dairy and e-commerce.
Our success has been and will be defined by how well we operate on a day-to-day basis in each of our plants and with each of our customers. The scale of the WestRock organization has supported our local success through our capital investment, our investment in people and connecting our coworkers so as to make it easier to share knowledge on how to succeed across the company and with our customers. We've continued our volume growth in October by increasing sales on a per-day basis by more than 3% over last year.
Our North American corrugated shipments in the quarter declined by 15,000 tons compared to the June quarter and 57,000 tons or 2.7% compared to last year. Export volumes declined by 29,000 tons compared to last year. Our overall export pricing declined $9 per ton compared to the June quarter and $37 per ton compared to last year.  Prices of containerboard to third-party domestic customers have been within a $5-per-ton range since the summer of 2014.
We took approximately 76,000 tons of downtime during the quarter, all except 3,000 tons being economic downtime. In October, we took about 95,000 tons of downtime in our corrugated mill system with approximately 55,000 tons being economic downtime, the remainder being maintenance downtime at our Florence mill.
We've consistently operated our system in a way that balances production with our customer demand. We plan and schedule this balance on an ongoing basis and take actions as needed, including slowbacks, economic downtime, maintenance downtime and permanent closures. Our goal is to pursue the actions that we believe will optimize our mill system, thus producing the best economic and operating results for WestRock and our customers.
We don't publicly announce our actions. We communicate our plans to the employees, customers and suppliers who'll be most directly impacted. This past month is an example of this planning and execution as we took actions at several facilities. With the October 1 completion of the SP Fiber transaction, we were able to reassess our overall mill system to determine the optimal way to meet our customers' demand.
Following this assessment, we announced indefinite downtime at both Fernandina Beach and Uncasville to immediately match our production to customers' orders. The following week, we announced the permanent closure of the 310,000-ton Coshocton, Ohio, mill, which will occur in late November to provide an orderly mill closure and consumption of raw materials, such as chemicals, wood and recovered fiber. The closure of Coshocton will reduce our annual operating cost by $33 million and avoid an additional $4 million annually in maintenance capital expenditures.
The same week, we announced an indefinite idling of our Newberg mill due to the unprofitable nature of the newsprint business and an inadequate order book on containerboard and bag grades. The mill will be idled in mid-November. We retained the optionality on the 2 excellent paper machines at Newberg in the event West Coast demand warrants a restart.
All these actions have been well planned and executed and went according to our expectations. When we take economic downtime, we communicate that it is indefinite because the period of downtime may change with market conditions or lead to a permanent closure.
We will continue to operate our system focused on our customers. Our plans to take -- our plan is to take 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime in our corrugated mills during the December quarter. The Fernandina Beach paper machine has been restarted and the Uncasville mill is being restarted mid-month, as planned, to meet our customer demand.
We're currently operating with 56,000 tons more inventory than we operated with 1 year ago. This additional inventory has helped improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction with both our internal and external box plant customers, and it's also reduced logistics cost. These benefits far outweigh the carrying cost of increased investment in inventory. Based on our forecasted sales and major maintenance and capital downtime plan, our containerboard inventories will gradually build an additional 30,000 tons from the end of September until they peak in the January-February time frame, then we would expect them to return to our current level over the following few months.
In Brazil, the economic situation continues to be challenging, and our great team in the regions managed to continue to deliver very strong results, including adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.2% and sales growth of 10% on a local currency basis. While industry box demand declined by more than 5%, we grew box volume by 3% year-over-year, with strength in protein, produce and export markets.
In September, our mill in Brazil set new production and shipment records. The interaction between our North American and Brazilian corrugated teams has benefited both businesses, so we've been able to drive improved productivity at our mills and box plants.
In 2016, GDP in Brazil is expected to decline by approximately 2%, and industrial production is expected to decline by approximately 6%. While our corrugated business in Brazil is not immune to these challenges, we expect to continue to perform well due to our high-quality assets, customer service and the differentiation of our virgin-based paper and packaging offerings.
In the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall results reflect good commercial and operational execution in the face of some difficult macro headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales in the segment declined $140 million or 8% when compared to last year. This includes $37 million of negative impact from currency. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $14 million lower due to $8 million of foreign exchange impact and $4 million from the sale of the European tobacco business. Segment EBITDA margins were 15.6%.
In the paperboard markets, our SBS food service volumes grew, and our general folding carton and food markets are doing well. Industry SBS backlogs are 393,000 tons, somewhat lower than the 454,000 tons the same time last year. Our backlogs are 3.5 weeks.
We're making very good progress integrating the Carolina brand that we acquired earlier this year. Sales during the quarter were at a rate equivalent to 180,000 tons per year. We expect to fully transition manufacturing to our facilities by the end of December.
One of the first opportunities from the merger was to integrate SBS tons into our folding carton system, and we're already more than halfway to achieving a full annual run rate of 50,000 tons by the end of December. During the quarter, these domestic SBS shipments more than offset softer exports for tobacco and liquid packaging grades.
Industry backlogs for coated recycle board remained strong at approximately 165,000 tons, which is more than 40% higher than this time last year. WestRock CRB backlogs are greater than 4% -- 4 weeks. We are moving production of our Millennium board product from our Dallas and Stroudsburg mills to the Mahrt mill. We're backfilling both Dallas and Stroudsburg with additional CRB business.
Demand for CNK remains solid, and our backlogs are nearly 4 weeks. Mill shipments grew by more than 3%, supported by growth from our beverage system. In North America, we largely offset declines in carbonated volumes with gains with our larger brewer customers, continued growth with craft brewers and gains in water. In Europe, we saw stronger sales with our larger brewer customers. On the Asia Pacific region, we saw improvement in carbonated soft drinks and dairy packaging.
Our broader folding carton business also performed extremely well, with share gains and new business in categories such as on-the-go foods offsetting declines in areas such as cereal. Our general folding carton volumes were up 2% during the quarter, a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year growth. Our operational performance in our carton facilities was also strong with better plant loading and efficiency gains. Our home, health & beauty business improved income and margins due to favorable mix from sales of trigger sprayers and health care dispensing systems as well as productivity gains.
And in our merchandising displays business, we saw a strong rebound with quarterly earnings up 55% over the prior year. After a challenging year that included some sales decline, we're seeing signs of growth and a strengthening market for promotional displays. Our decisions over the last couple of years to strategically invest capital to lower our cost has had a significant positive impact. We've invested in our innovation platform, and that's supporting our growth in new markets, including recently earning awards of new business that helped us end the year on a very positive note. Many of our customers are learning more about our capabilities. We've taken advantage of these opportunities to discuss our full product line and to learn about our customers' objectives so we can develop paper and packaging solutions that help our customers meet their objectives.
Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform well in the face of the slowdown in drilling and other industrial activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins remained very attractive at 24.9%, even as sales declined by $26 million compared to last year. Ingevity is starting up a new activated carbon plant in China this quarter and expanding our pine chemicals plant in Brazil at the first of the year. The activated carbon plant in China will provide needed capacity for our global system that supports the growing automotive sector.
We're making good progress in qualifying the new production with our automotive customers in Asia and beyond and expect sales to ramp up in the first half of next year.
The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for Specialty Chemicals. This is principally due to the winter slowdown in the road-paving activity. We expect continued challenges in the oilfield sector, which impacts the segment sales levels and margins.
I'm very pleased that both Michael Wilson and John Fortson have joined Ingevity as CEO and CFO, respectively. They both bring tremendous and highly relevant experience to the business. We have confidence in their ability to lead Ingevity through these challenges and to a period of growth as an independent company. The spin-off of Ingevity is moving forward. The initial Form 10 was filed, and we're targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.
The Land and Development business continues to make good progress on their major projects in the Charleston region. The business had a fantastic quarter from a revenue standpoint with $45 million in revenue, including a $34 million gain related to the 68 -- I mean, the sale for $34 million related to the 6,800-acre site that Volvo acquired to build their new U.S. manufacturing facility.
But due to the impact of purchase price accounting and revaluing their existing projects to fair value, they lost $3 million on a GAAP basis. The step-up in book value had a $15 million negative impact on segment income in the quarter. This marking to fair market value of our land portfolio in this business will reduce future profitability on existing projects, but it does not impact future cash flows.
As part of the valuation work, we have developed a project-by-project valuation of the partnership, which, for our share, is over $400 million. The experienced team in this business is executing on the plan to maximize this potential value. We're considering ways to monetize that value at a faster pace.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward Dickson. Ward?"

Productivity and synergies drove $60 million in earnings improvement. FX was a negative $26 million headwind, which -- with much of that in Europe and Brazil. And the total impact of inflation of labor and commodities for the segments and corporate was $20 million. The change in labor and benefits was approximately $29 million, and there was $9 million of combined deflation in commodity and other cost categories.
The total impact of price and mix changes was minimal in the quarter. Corrugated Packaging had positive price/mix variance in due -- in part due to stable domestic box pricing, higher prices in Brazil, lower volumes of exports and domestic tons shipped, and an increase in the higher-margin box shipments. There was some decline in price and mix in the Consumer Packaging grades and Specialty Chemicals.
Noncash pension income was $26 million lower than last year due to, among other things, lower return on asset assumptions as we derisked our pension plans. The nonrecurring amount of $29 million includes $23 million from last year's spare parts gains that didn't recur this year.
We made significant progress during our first quarter as WestRock toward our $1 billion synergy and productivity improvement target. We entered the quarter at a run rate of $75 million in savings and exited at an annualized run rate in excess of $150 million, which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. This is a significant objective that will take a lot of work over the next 3 years to capture.
Our entire organization is focused on meeting these objectives, and we have consistent monitoring and processes in place to make sure we stay on track so we are confident in our ability to reach $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. We estimate that we will be at an annualized run rate of at least $400 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016.
Our total SG&A costs for the quarter were $429 million or 11% of sales. However, this total includes $64 million in ongoing merger and acquisition-related intangible amortization cost that flow through the $281 million depreciation and amortization line on our cash flow. Excluding intangible amortization, our SG&A costs are running at 9.4% of sales and will trend lower as we execute on our synergy and performance improvement program.
We have completed our work to allocate corporate cost to the appropriate business units, all the way down to the costs in our level. The full cost allocation brings further visibility into spending and business unit profitability. When comparing legacy RockTenn and MWV, approximately 70% of RockTenn's corporate costs were allocated to the business units, and MWV was approximately 30% allocated.
There was also some geography changes in the allocation work as some legacy MWV manufacturing site costs for nonproduction activities in the amount of $18 million were moved from cost of goods sold to SG&A. And as Steve said, we have included Slide 19 that provides a reconciliation of reported-to-recast segment income and EBITDA for Q4 FY '14 for comparability purposes.
We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in reported debt. And included in that figure is approximately $340 million in fair value step-up to the market value of the legacy MWV debt. The notional amount of what we owe under our debt obligations are approximately $5.3 billion.
Our balance sheet is in great shape as we have $3.4 billion in available liquidity to support our strategy and very few maturities over the next several years. Our leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.08x.
Our pension plans are in great shape, and we ended the fiscal year with almost $400 million in combined GAAP-funded status surplus in our qualified U.S. and Canadian pension plans. The U.S. plans were overfunded by more than $500 million, and the Canadian plans were underfunded by more than $100 million. The overfunding in the U.S. plans gives us options as we think about derisking our balance sheet.
Slide #13 has a number of key financial items to help in modeling our performance. Depreciation and amortization will continue to be approximately $285 million on a quarterly basis. And of that total, intangibles amortization is approximately $70 million.
Our CapEx is still estimated at $850 million for the full year. The pension income of $8 million represents both the qualified and nonqualified plan amounts. Our books -- our book tax rate should be in the range of 33% to 35% for the December quarter. The September quarter effective tax rate of 29% was lower than our forecast due to discrete items, primarily at the state tax level.  We are planning scheduled maintenance downtime within our corrugated mill system of 114,000 tons during the quarter.
Other items incorporated in our tax position also included $21.5 million of nontax-deductible restructuring piece. Cash pension contributions into our qualified pension plans are approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016, with almost all of that going into our Canadian plans. Our nonqualified or SERP plans will require additional cash funding of approximately $13 million this fiscal year. We have $115 million in state, federal and foreign NOLs and $213 million in AMT and other federal credits.
And now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

Looking to the immediate future, there's a number of items that will impact our performance in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We'll see benefits from our performance improvement initiatives. Our domestic box and folding carton businesses continue to do well as compared to the market.
Energy prices are lower, which is a positive for us. There's 3 less shipping days this quarter, and the December quarter historically has lower seasonal sales volumes than the September quarter. Maintenance and economic downtime will have a negative earnings impact. The euro and Brazilian real have both softened from September averages, and we expect return to normal tax rates. Considering all of these items in the quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be lower in the December quarter as compared to last quarter.
Looking further out, WestRock aspires to be the global leader in corrugated and consumer packaging. The first step for WestRock to achieve this aspiration is to combine and integrate our organizations and in the process, capture $1 billion in merger-related efficiencies and productivity improvements. We're on the road to capture this opportunity over the next 3 years.
We've made a lot of progress in our business in just 4 months. We've made progress building our culture at WestRock, progress making our operations more efficient and, more importantly, progress teaming with our packaging customers to grow their share in the marketplace. While paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, the global economy, a strong U.S. dollar and intense competition challenge us across our businesses. We're responding to these challenges with urgency, both to deliver short-term results but also to keep our eye on the long-term opportunity we have within our sights. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that are ahead of us and believe we're making excellent progress in the long-term value creation opportunities we have as WestRock.

So we were able to immediately take some capacity -- production capacity out with the indefinite idling of the Fernandina Beach paper machine 3 and the Uncasville facilities, followed quickly by the announcement of the permanent closure of the Coshocton mill, which takes some time to properly close in order to provide an orderly shutdown and to optimally consume chemicals, raw materials, fiber, wood, et cetera.

Steve mentioned in his prepared comments, it had a terrific quarter, and they continue to build on this track record of improvement that you have seen in the business over the last 2 years now, which has come from a combination of things. It's been a better commercial strategy targeting more attractive niches in the global market, better plant loadings and better productivity. And we have made incremental investments in that business that are required to support our customers, our partners with their particular rollouts. So it's all working together and continues to show a very positive trend. In terms of the fit question, we like it for 3 reasons. One is the overlap that the home, health & beauty dispensing system business has with our other paper and packaging businesses. Roughly $1 million -- $1 billion of WestRock sales are to customers that buy dispenser products and other paperboard and packaging products from WestRock. We also have really strong relationships with these customers through the dispensing system business, because it's a highly technical and innovative business, and so these are more like partnerships, which, then, we can leverage with our other packaging businesses. And then finally, it's a global business, which gives us the opportunity to reach beyond the North American borders. So we still feel very good about the fit and the performance of that business."

And it's great that it's a merger, because one of the big issues we had in Smurfit, I'm going to put into the category of culture, that we were integrating into our organization. At the time, I was CFO. My job tripled overnight, and then, the Smurfit organization had not just been successful over a long period of time. And that is -- continues to be a lesson for me of how that can really impact a culture. This merger is very much different. Because I think most of the people on the call would have known of both companies, and WestRock's bringing the best of both companies to the table. We're highly complementary. I think you could pro forma either company, and I guess, we are trying to pro forma both companies going forward. And we've got a tremendous future together, which is better than either company would have on its own. So depending on what side you're on, we can go through -- enumerate the opportunities. But we effectively -- from a culture standpoint, we've put a much greater emphasis on that. And so we are moving beyond -- this is a merger of 2 companies, but it's a creation of a new company, which is WestRock, and we're working together. I'm very optimistic about the future of the company. And I think on -- in the call, I think we focused a lot on a very discrete set of actions we took, which, I think, were misinterpreted by the business. But underlying that, I think we're performing at an exceptional level, that we're delivering the merger and performance improvements. Somebody asked about is there -- was there a surprise? And I would like to think that there's an expectation we're going to go out and get that. But we are meeting that expectation, I'd say, with enthusiasm across the organization. And that's going to end up -- what we need to do that to be successful. While all that is going on, we have -- I think each one of our businesses on a day-to-day basis is operating exceptionally well. I'm very excited about the reaction we're getting from the customers. They're coming to us and asking us what can -- what's this about, and we're having a conversation, which is a little bit early to tell what the ultimate tale of the tape is, but I think it's going to position us to be a remarkably successful company going forward.

I think, as you know, having all of the business, the Specialty Chemical business that will become Ingevity, is a highly flexible business around its refinery system. And oilfield technologies has definitely seen the impact of what's happening in the broader sector. But let me give you a couple of statistics to put it into perspective. So well counts -- oil well counts are down about 65% across the industry year-on-year, yet our revenue in that specific sector is only down about 40%. So we're actually taking share in the downmarket in oilfield, which is a market that we really like for its profitability. And that's because we just have really great, highly differentiated products. And at the same time, we're able to shift business over to the industrial specialties. Yes, there's been some pricing movement with the dislocations that are occurring, very modest offset in volume. But as I said earlier in one of my answers, we're able to move into some other areas that help offset that volume decline. And asphalt pavement technologies has been an example of that, up 19% versus prior year.
