As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, in our press releases, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations.
Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by the average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.

Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18%, excluding the $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year.
EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA units, represented more than 40% of seller units.
Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion.
North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.85 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion, and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10%, excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory returns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.
And now, back to Tom with guidance."

Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail at our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income compared to $146 million of income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services beginning with first quarter 2015. We remain hands-down focused on driving a better customer spread through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions."

Is it timing or is at the proposition? The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position and no -- it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you're hiring aggressively both in engineering and sales.

We're making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon. And we're super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that, certainly, in our CapEx numbers and the assets we're acquiring, with some of our capital leases, you see that represented. So again, we are investing very heavily both in terms of people as well as capital for that business. And we share your excitement about the business.
In terms of the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography. And we continue to make it better in all of the geographies that your code -- that we have Prime. That's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by geography a bit. And -- but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing of the proposition is a little bit different will continue to work on making it better for the geographies that we have. but then the timing was different.

You're seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out, certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong.

And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley the last couple of weeks about this global the kind of indicating a little bit of a shift in consumers interest more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition of customers is shifting. if it's shifting to be less on price over the last couple of years and, are you see that kind of shift?

In terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we've talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They're getting their product -- physical product to them faster when they're -- versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that, so certainly speed of delivery helps. We also see -- we need to make sure, and it's something that we're always focused on, is having -- make sure we have great prices. And that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we focus on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to be -- have the selection be in stock when a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't think -- I don't view it as a shift. I view it as this certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There's just a tremendous amount of transparency. We think we like that world, and that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world.

In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly, as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step up in their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we're seeing -- another thing that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way. We see, for example, although it's still very early and we're learning and investing in this area. But take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they're renewing at higher rates than others. We see those people who were -- customers who were screaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't.
And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great. And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right now. And we're -- with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting and something that we're very focused on as we continue forward."

And obviously, years ago, we put the videogame console as part of our video to keep it with videogames and they're kind of larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the growth rate and compare '13 -- Q4 '13 growth to Q4 '14 growth. There. In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend. But given the high usage rates that we've had in Web Services, you should expect that we'll be sending CapEx support that growth. And we'll certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. If you look at our capital lease activity, point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly, a number of different investments -- different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business, primarily on the AWS side.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press releases, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations.
Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by the average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.

Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18%, excluding the $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year.
EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units, represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion, and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10%, excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.
And now back to Tom with guidance."

Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail at our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income compared to $146 million of income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter 2014.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services beginning with first quarter 2015. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions."

And you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it the proposition? The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position and no -- and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you're hiring aggressively both in engineering and sales.

We're making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon, and we're super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that, certainly, in our CapEx numbers and the assets we're acquiring with some of our capital leases, you see that represented. So again, we are investing very heavily both in terms of people as well as capital for that business. And we share your excitement about the business.
In terms of the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography. And we continue to make it better in all of the geographies that were -- that we have Prime. That's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by geography, a bit. And so -- but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we'll continue to work on making it better for the geographies that we have it in but the timing is different.

You're seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out, certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers, and last year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong.

In terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we've talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They're getting their product -- physical product to them faster when they're -- versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that, so that certainly speed of delivery helps. We also see -- we need to make sure, and it's something that we are always focused on, is having -- make sure we have great prices, and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we focus on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to be -- have the selection be in stock when a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't think -- I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there's certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There's just a tremendous amount of transparency. We think we like that world, and that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs, so that we can be successful in that world. And that's not something new. That's something we've been focused on for a long time."

In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly, as you think about customers, who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step-up in their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we're seeing -- another thing that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way. We see, for example, although it's still very early and we're learning and investing in this area. But take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial. Those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they're renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people, who were -- customers who were screaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't.
And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great. And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right now. And we're -- with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting and it's something that we're very focused on as we continue forward."

So if you go at the growth rate in Q4 last year of meaning in 2013 and Q4 '14, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year. And obviously, years ago, we put the video game console as part of North American media to keep it with video games and their kind of larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the growth for when you compare '13 growth -- Q4 '13 growth to Q4 '14 growth there. In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend. But given the high usage rates that we've had in Web Services, you should expect that we'll be spending CapEx to support that growth and we'll certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity, point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly, a number of different investments the are -- a number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing. But the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business, primarily on the AWS side. So again, that's also included in that number."

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press releases, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.

Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by the average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.

Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18%, excluding the $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year.
EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion, and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10%, excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.
And now back to Tom with guidance."

Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail at our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter 2014.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services beginning with first quarter 2015. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions."

Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it proposition? The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position and now -- and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you're hiring aggressively both in engineering and sales.

We're making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon, and we're super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that, certainly, in our CapEx numbers and the assets we're acquiring with some of our capital leases, you see that represented. So again, we are investing very heavily both in terms of people as well as capital for that business. And we share your excitement about the business. In terms of the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography. And we continue to make it better in all of the geographies that were -- that we have Prime. That's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by geography, a bit. And so -- but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we'll continue to work on making it better for the geographies that we have it in but the timing is different.

So we're very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers. In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You're seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out, certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers, and last year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong.

We also see -- we need to make sure, and it's something that we are always focused on, is having -- making sure we have great prices, and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we focus on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to be -- have the selection be in stock when a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there's certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There's just a tremendous amount of transparency. We think -- we like that world, and that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs, so that we can be successful in that world. And that's not something new. That's something we've been focused on for a long time."

In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly, as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step-up in their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we're seeing -- another thing that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way. We see, for example, although it's still very early and we're learning and investing in this area. But take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial. Those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they're renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people, who are -- customers who are streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great. And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right now. And we're -- with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting and it's something that we're very focused on as we continue forward."

But certainly, by far, the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game consoles. So if you go at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning in 2013 and Q4 '14, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year. And obviously, years ago, we put the video game consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and their kind of larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the growth for when you compare '13 growth -- Q4 '13 growth to Q4 '14 growth there. In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend. But given the high usage rates that we've had in Web Services, you should expect that we'll be spending CapEx to support that growth and we'll certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity, point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly, number of different investments that are -- number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing. But the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business, primarily on the AWS side. So again, that's also included in that number."

In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by the average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.
I'll turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights."

Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18%, excluding the $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year.
EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion, and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10%, excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.
And now back to Tom with guidance."

Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail at our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter 2014.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services beginning with first quarter 2015. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions."

You have a leadership position and now -- and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you're hiring aggressively both in engineering and sales.

So again, we are investing very heavily both in terms of people as well as capital for that business. And we share your excitement about the business. In terms of the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography. And we continue to make it better in all of the geographies that were -- that we have Prime. That's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by geography, a bit. And so -- but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we'll continue to work on making it better for the geographies that we have it in but the timing is different.

So we're very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers. In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You're seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out, certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers, and last year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong.

In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly, as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step-up in their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we're seeing -- another thing that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way. We see, for example, although it's still very early and we're learning and investing in this area. But take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial. Those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they're renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people, who are -- customers who are streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great. And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right now. And we're -- with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting and it's something that we're very focused on as we continue forward."

But certainly, by far, the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game consoles. So if you go at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning in 2013 and Q4 '14, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year. And obviously, years ago, we put the video game consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and their kind of larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the growth for when you compare '13 growth -- Q4 '13 growth to Q4 '14 growth there. In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend. But given the high usage rates that we've had in Web Services, you should expect that we'll be spending CapEx to support that growth and we'll certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity, point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly, number of different investments that are -- number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing. But the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business, primarily on the AWS side. So again, that's also included in that number."

ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based towards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately $278 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. In addition, we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%. 
In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior-year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to international segment operating loss was $78 million.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $255 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS's segment operating income decreased 13%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior-year period.
Our income tax expense was $71 million, GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improving stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be approximately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public fact filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income compared to a $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience to price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that's something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly -- all those things we're working on globally, so those are things that at least in most geographies, we have today. One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at the growth rate for Q1 is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1, there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some, we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year, so it's a headwind, if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking -- we think there's still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime's growing at a faster rate. We think there's still a great opportunity to add unique selection for category expansion, and again -- so we're going to continue to feed the Prime platform, as he talked about continue to add selection, and a lot of categories. We're also very excited about India. If you take a look at our results from an operating profit standpoint, you see that there was an approximately negative $76 million basis, if you back out exchange, that's approximately break even. Included in there, we certainly have a sizable step up in investment in India, and we're super excited for what we see there right now.

My first is -- my first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the -- most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America, which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that the brick-and-mortar retailer books despite the large benefit booking of 3P. Here's the question. Prime is not really North America, you probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the U.S. north of 30 million, 40 million, 50 million, yet margins are still low. What gives you the confidence that the investments you are making will pay off? Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed. Are these still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS is, I don't know, 2, 5 or 10x its current size, or do you expect that needs to scale up as the same rate as revenues?"

And so it gives you a feel for the work that we've put into Prime to make that experience great for customers, and the value that we're giving them, so again, given that growth. So that's certainly one of the things that gives us comfort. But when we look at the individual pieces, we like what they see. So in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as he talked about the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and licensed content. We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers. And what we've seen today is it certainly is still an investment for us and certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline, if you will, for video content. They convert at a higher rate. We see -- we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who stream actually, we retain those at a higher rate. And we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipelines. So in other words, they're buying very good from a physical product standpoint as well as digital, so they're buying a diverse set of products. So in other words, the video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumables from us, they'll by clothing from us, they'll buy shoes from us, they'll buy electronics, they'll buy media items, so that's what we're seeing. So again, it's some of these things very early and we'll have to see over time how efficient they are, but each period we go, we keep -- the data that we see, we're encourage. And so that's just one example, but that's why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it's a great -- the Prime platform, if you will, we think is a great opportunity.

So I guess the big question I want to ask you is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next -- this year and the next couple of years, versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were, I think particularly higher and now you'll be recovering to those levels.

We go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we, as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on taking sure that we get productivity, so we're going to both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. That's what's helping us with the improvement that Brian mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year in different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that. But again, we think there's opportunities to improve margins over time. You'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we're certainly, as you can see from not only the results but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters, we are investing heavily in the business.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary in the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, international and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and",1029,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based towards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately $278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. In addition, we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.
In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior-year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to international segment operating loss was $78 million.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS's segment operating income decreased 13%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior-year period.
Our income tax expense was $71 million, GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income compared to a $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that's something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly -- all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies, we have today. One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at the growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1, we talked about in April 1, there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some, we think, some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year, so it's a headwind, if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking -- we think there's still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime's growing at a faster rate. We think there's still a great opportunity to add unique selection for category expansion, and again -- so we're going to continue to feed the Prime platform, as we talked about, continue to add selection and a lot of categories. We're also very excited about India. If you take a look at our results from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative $76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange, that's approximately breakeven. Included in there, we certainly have a sizable step-up in investment in India, and we're super excited from what we see there right now.

Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the U.S., 30 million, 40 million, 50 million, yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments you are making will pay off? Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even this fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are these still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS is, I don't know, 2, 5 or 10x its current size?

So it gives you a feel for the work that we've put into Prime to make that experience great for customers, and the value that we're giving them. So again, given that growth. And so that's certainly one of the things that gives us comfort. But when we look at the individual pieces, we like what we see. So in other words, from the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give -- one example would be video content, both original and licensed content. We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers. And what we've seen to date is it certainly is still an investment for us. It's certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline, if you will, for video content. They convert at a higher rate. We see -- we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who stream, actually, we retain those at a higher rate. And we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipelines. So in other words, they're buying very good from a physical product standpoint as well as digital. So they're buying a diverse set of products. So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us, customers who buy consumables from us, they'll by clothing from us, they'll buy shoes from us, they'll buy electronics, they'll buy media items, so that's what we're seeing. And so again, it's -- some of these things are very early. We'll have to see over time how efficient they are, but each period we go, we keep -- the data that we see, we're encouraged. And so that's just one example, but that's why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it's a great -- the Prime platform, if you will, we think is a great opportunity. And again, as I mentioned earlier, all these things we're investing in are very intertwined."

So I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next -- this year and the next couple of years, versus what you had, call it, in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were, I think, pretty clearly higher and now you're going to be recovering to those levels.

But what you mentioned is -- in some of the periods that you were describing, is you mentioned what our business looked like several years ago when we -- Prime was nascent and we were a bit early in the business. And so we go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we, as I mentioned last quarter, were spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. That's what's helping us with the improvement that Brian mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, there's a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that. But again, we think there's opportunities to improve margins over time. You'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we're certainly, as you can see from not only the results but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters, we are investing heavily in the business.

In terms of Web Services, it's obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there. In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today.

I mean, there certainly was an impact with pricing changes, and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well. But over the long term, that's the model we follow.
With that, thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter."

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23, 2015, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary in the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, international and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
18749,291091930,793870,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Amazon.com, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and",1029,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based towards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately 278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 260 million, up from approximately 230 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. In addition, we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.
In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior-year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to international segment operating loss was $78 million.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS's segment operating income decreased 13%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior-year period.
Our income tax expense was $71 million, GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income compared to a $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

And those happen to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So that's an added benefit. 25% of those are -- over 25% of those are exclusives to Amazon.

And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that's something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly -- all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies, we have today. One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at the growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1, we talked about in April 1, there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some, we think, some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year, so it's a headwind, if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking -- we think there's still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime's growing at a faster rate. We think there's still a great opportunity to add unique selection for category expansion, and again -- so we're going to continue to feed the Prime platform, as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories. We're also very excited about India. If you take a look at our results from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative $76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange, that's approximately breakeven. Included in there, we certainly have a sizable step-up in investment in India, and we're super excited from what we see there right now. We think it's very -- a big opportunity, and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity.

My first is -- my first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the -- most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America, which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that the brick-and-mortar retailer books despite the large benefit of booking 3P net. Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the U.S., 30 million, 40 million, 50 million, yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments you are making will pay off? Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even this fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are these still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS is, I don't know, 2x, 5x or 10x its current size? Or do you expect that it will scale up as the same rate as revenues?"

And that's after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99. So it gives you a feel for the work that we've put into Prime to make that experience great for customers, and the value that we're giving them. So again, given that growth. And so that's certainly one of the things that gives us comfort. But when we look at the individual pieces, we like what we see. So in other words, from the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give -- one example would be video content, both original and licensed content. We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers. And what we've seen to date is it certainly is still an investment for us. It's certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline, if you will, for video content. They convert at a higher rate. We see -- we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who stream, actually, we retain those at a higher rate. And we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipelines. So in other words, they're buying very good from a physical product standpoint as well as digital. So they're buying a diverse set of products. So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us, customers who buy consumables from us, they'll by clothing from us, they'll buy shoes from us, they'll buy electronics, they'll buy media items, so that's what we're seeing. And so again, it's -- some of these things are very early. We'll have to see over time how efficient they are, but each period we go, we keep -- the data that we see, we're encouraged. And so that's just one example, but that's why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it's a great -- the Prime platform, if you will, we think is a great opportunity. And again, as I mentioned earlier, all these things we're investing in are very intertwined."

So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. That's what's helping us with the improvement that Brian mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, there's a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that.

I'll begin the comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental fi",1080,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin the comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations.  The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
Return on invested capital was 17%, up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million  1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.  Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. 
Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million, up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. 
Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared to 69.3%.
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments will reflect North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based allocation, but the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues.  North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million, a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
In the international segment, revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 72% of international revenues.  International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 168%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period.
Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.
Coming to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.4 billion. And inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.  Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion. And accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guid are the order trends that we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as  settling intercompany balances in foreign currency among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effect on guidance. The guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q3 2015, we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.
We remain hands-down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

The vast majority of that is in operations where we're adding people for our new SCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers. And so for this particular quarter is colored a bit by operations growth. If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day, surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we looked at, we think it was a huge success. Customers saved millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rate than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So it's a great success. My hats off to the operations team and all the people who worked on that. Because it was a Christmas in July, quite frankly, bigger day than Black Friday as we said and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide unit growth approached 300%. So not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers, which is great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance."

We're really following of giving customers as many choices as many possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first party or third party. And I think we're working hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FBA sellers had with Prime Day. But we see FBA as a tailwind for the third-party business in general. When we surveyed those sellers in the past in 2014, about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we're really happy with what that for our third-party business. We're working really hard to give our customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. We don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice.  On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business. And you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins at AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 40 times since launch.

So that's looking great. Efficiency, yes, as we talked about in the last few calls, we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say, what does that look like? With defect reduction and process improvements are maybe something we've always done and worked on both to lower our costs, but also improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience. We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people. We think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate,  especially as we insert machine learning into those decisions. We said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business as on the Amazon side as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our performance centers and throughput of the performance centers. And just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses and our sort centers that we added primarily last year, all have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on just on the specifics of the efficiency area."

And secondarily, I mean similar to China, you have pretty large population base and Internet penetration growth that is probably comparable to what was the case when you had Joy or when you acquired Joy . Can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China?"

So FBA, easy ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers. They make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there's a lot of investments, a lot of efforts going on in that front. I would say India and China are totally different. And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we're seeing there so far. so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and to have the opportunities we do at that point."

Off , the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will, they work great with our devices, by the way. And they drive other nonmedia sales. So they're very tied together, although certainly, the EGM is outpacing the media segment and the media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again your -- we have a combination of shipping and using third-party carriers. So the rate increases are staged in. And we see those quite frequently. So nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we're looking to always to to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have. And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers. So that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one."

Actual results may differ materially.  Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

18749,306406016,837826,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Amazon.com, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental f",1083,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
Return on invested capital was 17%, up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million, up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. 
Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%.
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues.  North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million, a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
In the international segment, revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 72% of international revenues.  International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 168%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period.
Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion. And inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion. And accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effect on guidance. The guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q3 2015, we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.
We remain hands-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

Customers love them businesses that can grow to be a large size, that can generate a higher return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades.

Any metric we looked at, we think it was a huge success. Customers saved millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So it's a great success. My hats off to the operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was a Christmas in July, quite frankly, bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said, and orders increased 266% year-over-year.

When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014, about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we're really happy with what that's doing for the third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice. On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving cost out of the business.

I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say, what does that look like? With defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our costs, but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience. We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people. We think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into those decisions. As I said earlier, we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business as -- on the Amazon side as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and throughput of the fulfillment centers.

We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think, you can look forward to a continuation of that into the future."

I mean, to my knowledge, I mean, foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first-party retail operations. But given the fulfillment and hence, customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys, what steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good, if not better, for the inventory on which you have no direct control? And secondarily, I mean, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration currently that's probably comparable to what was the case when you had Joyo -- when you acquired Joyo. So can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China?"

I think, we're seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that EGM growth is much -- is very strong. Media growth has been consistent for the last 4 quarters.

There's a lot of pipeline of invention, things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music, [indiscernible] Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will, they work great with our devices, by the way. And they drive other non-media sales. So they're very tied together, although certainly, the EGM is outpacing the media segment -- or excuse me, media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, your -- we have a combination of our own shipping and using third-party carriers. So the rate increases are staged in. We see those quite frequently. So nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think, we're looking always to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have. And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers. So that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one."

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental f",1081,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
Return on invested capital was 17%, up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million, up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. 
Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%.
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues.  North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million, a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
In the international segment, revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 72% of international revenues.  International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 168%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period.
Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion. And inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion. And accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effect on guidance. The guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 2015, we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

We're continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we're in. But we're also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace, Prime and AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think, Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said, we're going to look for things that are important to customers. Customers love them -- businesses that can grow to be a large size, that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses that we think fit that profile. And we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile.

Any metric we looked at, we think it was a huge success. Customers saved millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So it's a great success. My hat's off to the operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was a Christmas in July, quite frankly, bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said, and orders increased 266% year-over-year.

I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say, what does that look like? We have defect reduction, and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our costs but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience. We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think is more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into those decisions. As I said earlier, we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business as -- on the Amazon side as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and throughput of the fulfillment centers.

We have a policy of not commenting on a road map, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well, and we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well, and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there and sort of the linkage between Marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. So all those things are going on. As you've seen, EGM strength across a lot of the categories there. There was no single category we're really calling out but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well."

But philosophically, if we go back a few quarters, you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years start to benefit and pay off. And we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North American retail. And it looks like you're still investing heavily on international retail. So if we kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high-level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now? Or are there any bigger investment areas, particularly in the retail business, that you might be looking to take advantage of?"

But I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now, which, again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content, including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have a robust device business, including a launch of a new Paperwhite, Fire TV, Echo with general availability, and numerous other products that we're very excited about that road map. We know that those devices drive customer engagement in sales. We've built fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners. And then we had things like same-day delivery, which we talked about. On the AWS side, we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening -- announcing a region in India, so there's expansion there as well. Feature expansion, services expansion, internationally, very similar to the U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today: the launch of Mexico, which we're excited about, an Amazon business. So lots of -- as I said, lots of investment in front of us, but we operate in 2 paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the businesses that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to a continuation of that into the future."

And secondarily, I mean, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration currently that's probably comparable to what was the case when you had Joyo -- when you acquired Joyo.

There's a lot of pipeline of invention, things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music, all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices, by the way. And they drive other nonmedia sales. So they're very tied together, although certainly, the EGM is outpacing the media segment -- or excuse me, media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, your -- we have a combination of our own shipping and using third-party carriers. So the rate increases are staged in. We see those quite frequently. So nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think, we're looking to always to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have. And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers. So that can have its benefits as well but not much more to add on that one."

I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months fre",1049,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion.
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares compared with 481 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.6 billion or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange.  EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. 
North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%.
Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of international revenues.
International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes -- excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior year period.
Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion. And inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion. And accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, a favorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
We remain hands-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

The -- first of all, the FX-neutral growth of 24% year-over-year is up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and to -- and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that in the comp. And the impact of Prime Day globally, we estimated about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both -- I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that in international as well. That was a great event for -- a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. But today's international growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook as the U.S., the additional Prime features. We launched the Prime Now location in the U.K. this quarter, not materially going to impact the entire continent but it's a good start. So we like the trends in international, and they mirror on the same things we see in North America. On AWS, I don't remember your question -- the business model there, yes, I mean, I talked about margin was up sequentially from Q2 from 21.4% to 25%. We are continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices 8 times since we had a large price cut in April of 2014 -- excuse me, April of 2014. And the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, 1/10 the price of other high-end commercial databases; a new storage class of Amazon S3, quick site also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains early days. And we enjoyed leading this business, and customers responded well. And we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. And the growth rates in margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward.

Well, I would point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation around new products and features and a lot of investment. We've already talked about India.

We built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including the readers, tablets that are priced under $50  echo, dash button. So there is a lot of investment going on, and they will be continued especially related to Prime. On the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company though is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more costs to work on as well. So we will -- I would say it's not as much as a pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will -- it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence, and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customers trends better."

And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming programming should be pretty good in the fall that the Man in the Highcastle are mostly watched by that. So we're excited about that one as well.

But we ship a lot of toys and bigger items, so it's hard to predict what that looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly helped our cost rupture in that area and having inventory closer to our customers."

I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months fr",1047,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less lease principal repayments, was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases, was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion.
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares, compared with 481 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.6 billion or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange.  EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. 
North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%.
Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of international revenues.
International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion. And inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion; and accounts payable days increased 79 from 74 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014.
We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

The -- first of all, the FX-neutral growth of 24% year-over-year is up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and to -- and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that in the comp. But -- and the impact of Prime Day globally, we estimated about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both -- I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that as international as well. That was a great event for -- a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. But the -- today's international growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook as the U.S. The additional Prime features. We launched the Prime Now location in the U.K. this quarter, not materially going to impact the entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in international, and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America. On AWS, I don't remember your question -- the business model there. Yes, then you talked about margin, it was up sequentially from Q2 from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices 8 times since we had a large price cut in April of 2014 -- excuse me, April of 2014. And they like -- \the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also -- enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, 1/10 the price of other high-end commercial databases; a new storage class of Amazon S3 quick site, also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains, yes, early days. And we enjoy leading this business, and customers responded well. And we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. And we -- the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we're very, very encouraged by the business, and so are customers."

And that includes video content and regional content, Prime Music. Phil just said the Prime Now has expanded to 14 metro areas. We've had same-day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under $50 -- Echo, Dash Button. So there is a lot of investment going on, and they will be continued especially related to Prime. On the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but it could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company, though, is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. So we will -- I would say it's not as much as a pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will -- it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence, and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better."

Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.6 billion or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange.  EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. 
North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%.
Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of international revenues.
International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion. And inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion; and accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014.
We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

The -- first of all, the FX-neutral growth of 24% year-over-year is up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and to -- and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that in the comp. But -- and the impact of Prime Day globally, we estimated about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both -- I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that as international as well. That was a great event for -- a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. But the base international growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook as the U.S. The additional Prime features. We launched a Prime Now location in the U.K. this quarter, not materially going to impact the entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in international, and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America. On AWS, I don't remember your question -- the business model there. Yes, let me talk about margin, which was up sequentially from Q2 from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices 8 times since a rather large price cut in April of 2014 -- excuse me, April of 2014. And they like -- the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also -- enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, 1/10 the price of other high-end commercial databases; a new storage class of Amazon S3 quick site, also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains, yes, early days. And we enjoy leading this business, and customers responded well. And we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. And we -- the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we're very, very encouraged by the business, and so are customers."

So a lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space. On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth. And so on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have.

We've been adding products at a rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year. And just as big is the number of sellers.

But domestically, we are -- or excuse me, globally, we are investing very heavily on our Prime platform, both in North America and international. And that includes video content and original content, Prime Music. Phil just said the Prime Now has expanded to 14 metro areas. We've had same-day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We've built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under -- or $50, Echo, Dash Button. So there is a lot of investment going on, and there will be continued especially related to Prime. On the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but it could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company, though, is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. So we will -- I would say it's not as much of a pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will -- it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence, and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better."

So by default, the international growth rate was higher. We like the adoption of Prime internationally. It's helped by additional selection that's available for fast-track shipment including FBA. So that flywheel is working. We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in U.K. and Germany. We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We launched Prime Now in the U.K. So it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time-lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates."

It's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime.
