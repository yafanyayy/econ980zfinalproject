Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. We had posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide opening remarks. Then, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our financial and operational performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 as well as our outlook for 2015. And after these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2015 outlook and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our pending acquisitions, future growth, industry trends and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in yesterday afternoon's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and in our other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
Please note that any reference to our International segment's organic core growth during today's call will exclude the impact of pass-through revenue. Given our ability to now capture passthrough on a site level basis for the full year 2014, we will be excluding it from our reported organic core growth metric starting in the first quarter of 2015.
In addition, this morning we announced our intention to commence an offering of common stock and mandatory convertible preferred security. Due to securities laws, we are precluded from answering any questions related to these offerings on this call and respectfully request that you focus any questions to our earnings-related materials.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim, who will discuss our long-term strategy in more detail."

Our Rental and Management segments generated over $4 billion in revenue for the first time in our company's history and delivered double-digit growth across all of our key metrics, including organic core revenue, rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share. The cash flow generation of our legacy assets combined with our disciplined approach to inorganic growth also enabled ATC to sustain return on invested capital at the 10% level.
Last quarter during my prepared remarks, I highlighted the industry trends that are developing across our served markets. Today, I'm going to review American Tower's long-standing fundamental strategy and provide segment performance data that clearly demonstrates the sustainable performance being delivered by the execution of that strategy.
Turning to Slide 5, when I came to American Tower nearly 14 years ago, we established a 3-pronged strategy for our business. Those 3 strategic pillars have not changed and they include:
One, to focus on operational excellence. We strive to further expand our leasing revenue opportunity by understanding our tenants' needs and satisfying them through our unique expertise in lease contracted. We then design our business processes to minimize cycle times and deliver superior capabilities in areas such as tower construction and power and fuel management to achieve a preferred supplier position with each of our customers.
Two, to maximize the compounding growth in cash flow that's generated from our existing properties, while selectively growing our asset base. We focus on driving organic growth, maintaining stringent cost controls and simultaneously investing in assets around the world but only those that meet our investment criteria.
And three, to maintain a strong balance sheet, to ensure we have a consistent access to capital markets at attractive rates in all market conditions to fuel our largest strategy.
Our ability to execute our strategic goals has led to total return outperformance versus the S&P 500 in 9 of the last 10 years and a cumulative total return, including REIT dividends of nearly 500% to our stockholders since 2005. In that timeframe, we've grown the company from a primarily domestic U.S. communications real estate provider with about 22,000 towers to a global leader in the industry with nearly 100,000 sites, counting our pending transactions with Verizon, Telecom Italia and Airtel. With a current enterprise value of over $51 billion today compared to $7 billion 10 years ago, we've not only established global scale but have also positioned American Tower as a credible and reliable partner to many of the world's leading multinational mobile operators.
As outlined on Slide 6, the bedrock of our major tenant partnerships are master lease agreements that leverage our scale to encourage additional revenue, while introducing process efficiency both to our own company and to our clients. Among the most effective of these contracts are the holistic contract structures that we have with 3 of the national carriers in the United States, which have significantly improved our revenue growth visibility while minimizing churn. As a result of this contract structure and pro forma for our pending acquisitions, we will have nearly $34 billion of noncancelable revenue or about 8x our 2014 revenues all in the books.
We've also created a culture of operational excellence throughout this organization, pushing cycle times lower and our customers' speed-to-market faster, all to support an improved customer experience that we hope further drives incremental revenue. Our aim is to make the colocation and amendment process as efficient as possible by aligning our processes and procedures with those of our customers. Since 2010, for example, we reduced our average cycle time for colocations for customers with holistic MLAs by 50%.
In another key operational area, tower construction, we demonstrated leadership and earning build-to-suit contracts in major markets, including the U.S, Brazil and India. Based on our well-established expertise and tower construction, we secured customer contracts to build over 3,000 towers in 2014.
Meanwhile, in our African markets and in India, we develop market-leading fuel and power management solutions to improve the reliability and operating efficiency of electrical power, increasing the attractiveness of American Tower's sites to both existing and prospective tenants.
The combination of our asset quality, strong contracts, operational execution and investment discipline is born out in our results in both the U.S. and abroad. As you can see on Slide 7, since 2011, we posted domestic organic core growth rates averaging more than 8%. The GTP portfolio, which generated organic core growth of 10.5% in 2014, and the Verizon towers, whose revenues we expect to grow at an average annual rate of around 9% to 10% for the next 5 years, are positioned to grow faster than the rest of our domestic base for the foreseeable future.
The Verizon portfolio, in particular, is poised for strong growth due to the fact that the properties have not been actively marketed previously and have very limited exposure to churn from its existing tenant base. In fact, our sales teams are already receiving inquiries from our customers regarding the Verizon properties who've always wanted to co-locate on them but never had the opportunity to do it.
In addition, we expect to convert about 85% of incremental revenues on both these portfolios into operating profit, given the minimal incremental expenses needed for colocations and amendments. The flow-through of future growth to AFFO in turn should also be very high. We expect the combination of our legacy assets and the newer GTP and Verizon portfolios to contribute meaningfully to our organic growth revenue and AFFO per share growth going forward.
By combining an attractive nationwide portfolio of assets with a strong tenant base, strategic contract structures and a focus on operational excellence, we believe that we've positioned our U.S. business to generate strong revenue and compounding cash flow growth for many years to come. We look forward to integrating the Verizon assets once the transaction closes, similar to the way we were able to outperform our integration targets for GTP. We also expect to aggressively lease up the Verizon towers beginning shortly after the close, especially given the pent-up demand that we believe exists on these franchise locations.
Turning to our international business on Slide 8, we've been able to deliver strong organic core growth over the last several years, significantly above that of the U.S. This reflects the aggressive network deployments of large multinational customers like Telefónica, MTN, Vodafone and many others across our international footprint and has been complemented by average gross margin conversion rates, excluding pass-through, of about 80% since 2010. While we continue to expect solid contributions to organic growth from existing assets, we also expect that under-marketed portfolios like Airtel Nigeria, when they're closed by us, will help generate very strong revenue growth going forward. The growth rates indicated on the chart for BR Towers, TIM and Airtel are the average annual revenue growth rates we expect each portfolio to generate over the next 5 years, as countries like Brazil and Nigeria accelerate the deployment of broadband mobile data. By diversifying our revenue stream internationally, focusing on large well-funded multinational carriers and deploying capital for high-growth assets, we believe that our International segment will further elevate and extend our growth trajectory beyond that of our core business for many years to come.
Strong organic growth across our global portfolio has helped drive rising tenancy and improving NOI yields, as you can see on Slide 9. On sites that we've actually marketed prior to 2005, we have increased the average tenancy to 2.7 tenants, resulting in $7,000 a month in revenues excluding pass-through and a gross margin percentage of approximately 89%. The combination of contractual escalators, amendment revenues and incremental colocations on these assets have led to an NOI yield of more than 25% on those properties. We've been able to replicate this kind of success on towers acquired and constructed between 2005 and 2010. The 2005 to 2010 vintage has an average of 2.3 tenants, over $4,000 in monthly revenues and a gross margin percentage of 85% excluding pass-through, while generating an NOI yield of nearly 23%. Our asset additions since 2010 have primarily focused on lower initial tenancy sites which are well-positioned for our teams to market the colocation. As a result, these relatively newer sites that we added to the portfolio from 2011 to 2013 currently have an average of 1.5 tenants per tower and a current NOI yield of nearly 8.5%, leaving plenty of room for growth.
We believe that we are optimally positioned to replicate our long history of transforming low tenancy, underutilized tower portfolios into high cash flow, high-margin assets with these newer sites. This includes also -- this also implies to our recently closed acquisition of BR Towers and our pending Verizon, TIM and Airtel power transactions. As previously highlighted, these assets all have existing capacity for incremental tenants in markets with strong wireless industry trends. As a result, we believe we positioned ourselves to deliver a number of years of strong organic growth and the further expansion of the initial NOI yields.
Underlying all of this is our ability to fund our growth initiatives with efficient and liquid sources of capital. And to that end, we launched the process to finance our Verizon transaction this morning. Meanwhile, we expect to fund our other pending acquisitions with TIM and Airtel through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under existing credit facilities and other debt financing. Our approach is designed to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, thereby positioning the company to effectively pursue the long-standing strategy that has served us and our shareholders so well today. By funding these high-growth assets in this manner, we expect to retain our investment-grade rating, while ending 2015 at a net leverage range in the mid-5s. In addition to collectively being accretive to AFFO per share right out of the gate, we expect these transactions in aggregate to generate substantial accretion to our AFFO per share over time. By combining our balance sheet strength with the other pillars of our corporate strategy, we have built a high-quality compounding cash flow stream with the lowest churn in the industry, a diversified customer base and exposure to the longest demand curve as a result of our high-growth international business.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our 2014 financial performance and 2015 outlook. Tom?"
24766,282864270,768306,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We finished 2014 with yet another strong quarter, achieving solid global organic core revenue growth, adding nearly 6,000 new tower assets and building on long-standing relationships with our wireless carrier customers",2482,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We finished 2014 with yet another strong quarter, achieving solid global organic core revenue growth, adding nearly 6,000 new tower assets and building on long-standing relationships with our wireless carrier customers. And as Jim just highlighted, we believe that our accomplishments over the last several years, particularly from a strategic perspective, will continue this momentum and extend our runway for growth for many, many years to come. 
If you please turn to Slide 11. We achieved strong growth in all of our key metrics in the fourth quarter. Our total rental and management revenue core growth was nearly 18%, which included another solid quarter of organic core growth at nearly 10%. Our commenced new business continued to be generated by large multinational carriers such as Verizon, Telefónica, T-Mobile and AT&T.
Domestic organic core growth was about 9%, with Verizon emerging as our top new business customer for the quarter. Internationally, we generated organic core growth of nearly 13%, with Brazil continuing to benefit from record levels of leasing demand and Ghana experiencing the highest level of organic core growth across our international markets at over 40%.
We also completed the acquisition of BR Towers in Brazil in mid-November, which contributed about $11 million in revenue for the quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDA core growth was 17% and was generated primarily by our rental and management segments, which continues to drive the most profitable growth within our business. We also generated strong core AFFO growth of nearly 22% in the quarter as a result of an adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio of over 100%.
Moving onto Slide 12. We're extremely proud of the results our teams have delivered in 2014 particularly versus our initial expectations. As you can see, we had meaningfully exceeded our initial outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. While some of this outperformance was due to acquisitions, the majority of the upside was driven by better-than-expected growth on our existing sites. A significant driver of this overachievement was our ability to generate organic core revenue growth rates about 200 basis points higher than the midpoint of our initial outlook. And importantly, we were able to convert nearly 85% of our over $140 million in revenue outperformance into adjusted EBITDA and nearly 90% of that adjusted EBITDA outperformance into incremental AFFO.
Turning to Slide 13 and reviewing our full year results. Our total rental and management core revenue growth was about 28%, with more than 10% attributable to organic core growth. The remainder of the growth was driven by the over 21,000 new assets we've added since the beginning of 2013, with averaged tenancies of around 1.4. We commenced 30% more new business on the entire portfolio in 2014 versus 2013, reflecting the significant investments wireless carriers are making in their networks globally.
Our 2014 core adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 27%, with reported adjusted EBITDA growth of about 22%. Similar to the fourth quarter, substantially all of our adjusted EBITDA growth for the year was attributable to our rental and management segments. Despite the addition of the new lower initial tenancy assets I mentioned earlier, we maintained our adjusted EBITDA margin at nearly 65%.
Core growth and AFFO was over 27%, and almost all of that growth was attributable to our rental and management segments. Factored into that AFFO growth was an issuance of an aggregate of $1.4 billion in new senior notes at a weighted average interest rate of about 4%. We also completed a $600 million issuance of a mandatory convertible preferred stock as part of our plan to fund growth initiatives.
We ended the year with over 75,000 sites in 12 markets around the globe and have nearly 23,000 additional towers that we expect to close in the first half of 2015. Our focus on building relationships with large global tenants and carefully structuring contracts to enhance revenue visibility while maintaining upside potential resulted in another year of consistent profitable growth and positions us well for 2015.
Turning to Slide 14. Our expectations for 2015 rental and management revenue growth reflect another healthy year of demand for tower space across our global footprint. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect consolidated rental and management core revenue growth of nearly 12% driven by organic core growth of about 8%, with the balance being generated from new properties, including the new sites we expect to build in 2015. We're forecasting consolidated churn of about 1.8%, which reflects the high contract renewal rates of our tenant base and the low number of contracts coming up for renewal this year. On a reported basis, we expect consolidated rental and management revenue growth of over 7% at the midpoint, including over 4% of negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a few million dollars from straight-line revenue accounting. As a reminder, none of the impacts from our pending transactions are included in these outlook numbers.
In the U.S. where we expect organic core growth of about 7%, we're forecasting commence new business in 2015 to decline about 25% versus 2014 levels driven by a slowdown in spending at AT&T. We've assumed that the other major carriers will be at least as active as they were in 2014 and if there is a reacceleration of AT&T spend, there could potentially be some upside later in the year.
In 2014, by comparison, excluding the equipment decommissioning agreement we discussed previously, our initial outlook implied an organic core growth of just around 7.8%. We ended up significantly exceeding that number by year-end as a result of our ability to capitalize on higher-than-expected customer demand. As 4G densification initiatives continue to support rapid expansion in mobile data usage, we believe we are well-positioned to generate solid organic core growth across our portfolio.
In our international markets, where we expect organic core growth of about 10%, we are forecasting total new business commencements to be in line with those generated in 2014. We expect our Latin American markets to have another very strong year in 2015 as carriers like Vivo in Brazil and Avantel in Colombia aggressively roll out 3 and 4G networks. African markets also are expected to perform well as large carriers like MTN and Vodafone roll out 3G across their footprints, with select 4G deployments in South Africa. Finally, we expect the activity in India at roughly comparable levels to 2014, with Reliance Jio continuing to deploy 4G in urban centers and the other major carriers following suit.
Turning to Slide 15, we also expect solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO in 2015. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we're forecasting core growth of nearly 12% at the midpoint of our outlook with reported growth of about 8%. This growth includes the impacts of unexpected decrease in services operating profit of about $12 million as compared to 2014 given the conclusion of several large services projects last year.
We remain focused on property level cost controls as well as SG&A cost and expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be right around 9%, similar to 2014. In addition, our land acquisition program continues to benefit our margins with over 2% of our U.S. land expense base eliminated to prior years' land purchase. Accordingly, EBITDA margins are expected to be over 65% and as we generate incremental new business across our portfolio of properties, we would expect our margins to continue to expand.
I just want to remind you that once our pending transactions close, due to their combined lower initial average tenancy of around 1.5 tenants per tower, our margins will temporarily decline. This does not change our long-term expectations of our ability to increase margins across the portfolio as we fully expect margin expansion on these assets once we begin actively marketing and leasing them up.
Turning to our outlook for AFFO, we expect core growth of over 13% at the midpoint, which will be driven by the growth in adjusted EBITDA net of interest cost associated with our 2014 acquisitions as well as slightly higher maintenance CapEx assumptions due to our larger asset portfolio. We expect all of our growth in AFFO to be generated by our rental and management segments. At the midpoint of outlook and assuming a weighted average diluted share count of just over 400 million shares, our outlook midpoint for AFFO per share will be around $4.91.
Moving onto Slide 16, in 2015, consistent with the last several years, we expect our primary method of returning capital to stockholders will be through our REIT distribution. The amounts and timing of our dividend payments are the discretion of our board but our goal continues to be to deliver annual dividend growth of over 20%.
We currently plan to spend between $800 million and $900 million in CapEx during the year, which includes the construction of about 3,000 sites at the midpoint, including around 150 to 250 sites in the U.S. Given our pending transactions in the U.S., Brazil and Nigeria and our global construction pipeline, we anticipate having about 100,000 sites by year-end. We also expect to spend about $180 million on land acquisitions while also targeting to opportunistically extend over 2,500 leases domestically. Pro forma for the Verizon Transaction, we expect to have over 60% of the land under our domestic sites owned or under our control for 20 years or more. 
Finally, we continue to maintain an active deal pipeline and continue evaluating acquisition opportunities around the world.
Our capital allocation priorities in 2015 will continue to support our corporate strategy of growing our asset base profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 17. We remain focused on strategically and opportunistically expanding our global business. This is reflected in the nearly 23,000 towers we expect to add to our portfolio through 3 transactions in the first half of this year. Our recently announced Verizon deal will enable us to add nearly 11,500 towers to our U.S. asset base while meaningfully expanding our relationship with a very high quality investment-grade tenant. As Jim noted earlier, we think this is an excellent portfolio of historically under-marketed, under-leased towers that are well-positioned to generate significant organic core growth for an extended period of time. We believe that this portfolio will generate compounded annual growth in revenue over the next 5 years of between 9% and 10% and will help us extend our organic growth trajectory in the U.S. We expect to close the Verizon transaction by the end of the first quarter.
We expect to close our previously announced transaction in Nigeria with Airtel in the first half of the year, which will allow us to commence operations in our newest high-growth international market. By acquiring about 4,800 sites from Airtel, we will gain meaningful scale in the country which has the largest economy in Africa, with a fast-growing wireless sector and an extremely young, extremely mobile population with virtually no fixed infrastructure in place. Similar to Ghana and Uganda, which generated organic core revenue growth of nearly 30% in 2014, we would expect these Nigerian sites to generate strong growth going forward to support our required high teen to low 20% unlevered returns.
And finally, we expect to acquire about 6,500 sites in Brazil for Telecom Italia, also in the first half of the year, which will bring our portfolio in the country to over 18,000 towers. Brazil has been one of our fastest-growing markets over the last several years, and organic core revenue growth in 2014 was over 19%. Given the current state of network infrastructure in Brazil, we believe that our customers will need to continue to make significant investments in their mobile networks. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from this given our strategically located footprint with a 20-year anchor lease with TIM on this portfolio and significant opportunities for organic leasing growth, we expect Brazil to be a key growth driver for our business going forward.
As a reminder, and as I've said, we have not included any impacts from these pending transactions in our current outlook for 2015. On an annualized year 1 basis, we would expect the portfolios to collectively generate revenues of around $815 million and gross margin of about $390 million. In addition, we expect them to collectively be modestly accretive to AFFO per share in their first full year and increasingly accretive thereafter.
Pro forma for these transactions, we expect to have nearly $34 billion in noncancelable revenues, representing over 8x pro forma 2014 revenue. With an average pro forma remaining lease term of nearly 7 years, we have a solid foundation on which to drive incremental revenue and cash flow for many years to come.
Moving onto Slide 18. Our pending transactions reflect the continuation of our long history of prudent capital deployment. As you can see on these charts, from 2007 to the midpoint of the 2015 outlook we issued this morning, we will have recorded annual growth rates in rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO of at least 14%, with growth in AFFO per share at nearly 16%. We have also simultaneously increased our return on invested capital, obtained an investment grade credit rating and have grown the company from just over 20,000 sites to a pro forma total of nearly 100,000 towers, creating the most comprehensive and diversified independently operated global network of towers in the world. As a result, we believe that we have positioned the business to continue to deliver consistent recurring cash flow base growth while generating compelling total returns for our stockholders.
On Slide 19 and in conclusion, we had another strong year in 2014, with core growth in rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO all over 27% and organic core growth of more than 10%. Given the ever increasing global demand for wireless services in our diverse portfolio, we expect another very solid year of profitable growth in 2015. By combining our high-quality legacy asset base with the more than 27,000 previously underutilized, under-marketed sites we will be adding through recently closed and pending transactions, we expect to extend our organic growth profile and enhance our ability to drive strong growth in AFFO per share over the long-term. We believe that our continuing focus on operational excellence, coupled with select strategic investments, solidifies our status as a premier global owner and operator of communications real estate.
And finally, as Leah mentioned right upfront, I do want to remind you that we have begun our efforts to finance our Verizon transaction. Under federal securities rules, we are limited in our ability to discuss the financing on this call. We ask that you please refer to our filings we have made this morning with the SEC for additional information.
And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

This set of Verizon towers fits",571,"First Amir, our track record of converting nonperforming assets, they are essentially single used by mobile operators into performing assets by commercially leasing them is pretty clear and we outlined those in the remarks. This set of Verizon towers fits exactly into that category. It's an asset that the previous owner had used to build its own network to try to get leadership in that space in the United States and wasn't necessarily focused on marketing those sites to gain lease revenue from other carriers or competitors, frankly. One just sort of specific item of evidence that indicates that we believe the towers are quite largely under-marketed is that unlike other companies in the mobile operator space in the U.S., Verizon never established that, to our knowledge, an internal tower business to go out and find lessees for these sites, process applications, generate business, et cetera. Other tower portfolio sort of traded in the last few years, again, it's our understanding that those organizations did exist and those companies and therefore the initial lease rates when those assets traded were significantly higher than the Verizon asset that we've disclosed. So we think there's a lot of pent-up demand right off the back, to answer your question, Amir, so that's the demand side of things. And our customers, as I said, already making inquiries into our sales and marketing team to get on many of these sites. They weren't necessarily in the view of those other customers available to them, and Verizon frankly wasn't se tup to effectively and quickly process applications and get them up on the towers. Our tenant base knows that's exactly our objective here, so they've already expressed interest. So that's really feels out the demand side of the equation on these sites for us. On the supply side, as we call it, the towers have, what I call, distinctive characteristics as far as height, as far as structural integrity, and our view is that this is a unique portfolio and that we expect it to have, on average, 1 available tenant structural capacity unit without any investment in redevelopment for that. So this is very high capacity portfolio with again we think distinctively sizable ground space under the tower that will enable us to put additional equipment for other customers there without necessarily having to expand the compound and getting additional land rights and paying for those. So both the demand side of the Verizon asset and the supply side we think are distinctively strong. And the other thing that I do want to highlight is Verizon operations team managed these assets in a manner that we would consider quite close to the way we would manage these assets in terms of documentation, in terms of maintenance. Just as a key example, the speed at which you can when you're a tower company lease-up sites is in large part initially dependent on the completeness of the literally the file that comes with the tower, things like ground leases, environmental studies, documentation on zoning and building permits and things like that, because when you go to lease that site to another customer, they're going to want to have all that material. We feel that again this is a distinctive portfolio in terms of the documentation that comes right with the tower.

In terms of the fit with our existing base, nearly 50% of the sites have no competing structures within a mile, and they're very well located sites for a potential public safety rollout. Many of the locations are in less urban areas, there's no alternative structures available. And given the kind of the model that we've laid out, we're really only talking about adding 1 additional tenant per tower on average over the entire 10-year period. The other element is given their low tenancy 1.4 tenants per tower, there's expected to be very little churn on these. Obviously, we have the anchor tenant of Verizon and the other third-party leasing activity are the other big 3 leasing companies. So we would expect to have very, very little churn going forward on this portfolio. So I think when you couple all of that, you conclude that the 9% to 10% is very achievable from our perspective."

So let's start with the U.S. Our largest volume of signed business right now in the U.S. is actually coming from Verizon, and that's an important point that I want to also highlight that the non-Verizon towers in the American Tower portfolio, non-Verizon transaction towers, is 75% of our U.S. portfolio roughly. So of the 40,000 plus sites, only 11.5 thousand are the Verizon towers pro forma, so there's plenty of places for Verizon to grow into with us. Just a further fact on that, the Verizon revenues that are on legacy ATC non-Verizon transaction towers is about 60%. So 60% of Verizon's pro forma revenue with us is going to continue to come on non-deal towers. Therefore, there's going to be nice amendment opportunity on over half that revenue base. So Verizon investing aggressively in its network going forward is going to actually be very helpful to our growth rate and could contribute to that 7% number that you pointed out there, Armintas. AT&T is still going to be very active, but as a comparison to last year, 2014 was the most active year that we have seen from our perspective with AT&T since I've been at the company. It was an outsized, probably a record year for them for mobile spending. In this year, 2015, is a more normalized year for AT&T and also still robust. So we expect new business from them as well. But we also see the number 2 application flow coming after Verizon from T-Mobile. So T-Mobile is actually increasing, in our view, its activity level in the network based on some projects that it has going. And then Sprint is continuing to work through 2.5 gigahertz in some other projects it has. So that's sort of batting order for U.S. application flow right now is Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint. Then turning to the international market of Brazil, which is our most significant pro forma international market in terms of revenue, we're seeing -- expecting 19% core organic growth, we just reported in 2014, we could say that now. So really high-growth market for this asset base, one of the things that encouraged us to add to the asset base going forward, which we've done with BRT and now TIM. As far as Brazil goes, you pointed out 2 of the most important factors, I think. One is the run-up to the Olympics and secondly is the 700 megahertz 4G auction and rollout that's going on. But I also want to cross-connect from the opposite direction all of Latin America by customers. So Telefónica, we expect to be extremely active in Brazil as well as Mexico. It's investing across Latin America in 3G deployment. As a corporation I think Telefónica wants to increase its competitiveness throughout Latin America in mobile data and Brazil and Mexico are the 2 biggest target markets simply based on their size for that, but it's going to be elsewhere. Also the run-up to the Olympics is going to be demanding investments by all 4 carriers, and TIM is included in that as well as, which is the AMEX subsidiary. So we really feel that Brazil is going to continue to be high-growth market for us. Of course, that contributed to our decisions to invest and upsize our scale to about 18,000 sites pro forma for the deal. And finally, on the M&A front, we don't speculate on potential deals. It's always fluid. But we are still in the market, and we're going to continue to apply our disciplined investment approach to fill in, especially in existing countries we have or existing customers we have opportunities that may come available, but we don't have anything specific to point to at the moment."

Our rental and management segments generated over $4 billion in revenue for the first time in our company's history and delivered double-digit growth across all of our key metrics, including organic core revenue, rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share. The cash flow generation of our legacy assets combined with our disciplined approach to inorganic growth also enabled ATC to sustain return on invested capital at the 10% level.
Last quarter during my prepared remarks, I highlighted the industry trends that are developing across our served markets. Today, I'm going to review American Tower's long-standing fundamental strategy and provide segment performance data that clearly demonstrates the sustainable performance being delivered by the execution of that strategy.
Turning to Slide 5, W.hen I came to American Tower nearly 14 years ago, we established a 3-pronged strategy for our business. Those 3 strategic pillars have not changed and they include:
One, to focus on operational excellence. We strive to further expand our leasing revenue opportunity by understanding our tenants' needs and satisfying them through our unique expertise in lease contracting. We then design our business processes to minimize cycle times and deliver superior capabilities in areas, such as tower construction and power and fuel management, to achieve a preferred supplier position with each of our customers.
Two, to maximize the compounding growth in cash flow that's generated from our existing properties, while selectively growing our asset base. We focused on driving organic growth, maintaining stringent cost controls and simultaneously investing in assets around the world, but only those that meet our investment criteria. And three, to maintain a strong balance sheet, to ensure we have a consistent access to capital markets at attractive rates in all market conditions to fuel our largest strategy.
Our ability to execute our strategic goals has led to total return outperformance versus the S&P 500 in 9 of the last 10 years and a cumulative total return, including REIT dividends, of nearly 500% to our stockholders since 2005. In that time frame, we've grown the company from a primarily domestic U.S. communications real estate provider with about 22,000 towers, to a global leader in the industry with nearly 100,000 sites, counting our pending transactions with Verizon, Telecom Italia and Airtel. With a current enterprise value of over $51 billion today compared to $7 billion 10 years ago, we've not only established global scale but have also positioned American Tower as a credible and reliable partner to many of the world's leading multinational mobile operators.
As outlined on Slide 6, the bedrock of our major tenant partnerships are master lease agreements that leverage our scale to encourage additional revenue, while introducing process efficiency, both to our own company and to our clients. Among the most effective of these contracts are the holistic contract structures that we have with 3 of the national carriers in the United States, which has significantly improved our revenue growth visibility while minimizing churn. As a result of this contract structure and pro forma for our pending acquisitions, we will have nearly $34 billion of noncancelable revenue or about 8x our 2014 revenues on the books.
We've also created a culture of operational excellence throughout this organization, pushing cycle times lower and our customers' speed-to-market faster, all to support an improved customer experience that we hope further drives incremental revenue. Our aim is to make the collocation and amendment process as efficient as possible by aligning our processes and procedures with those of our customers. Since 2010, for example, we reduced our average cycle time for collocations for customers with holistic MLAs by 50%.
In another key operational area, tower construction, we demonstrated leadership and earning build-to-suit contracts in major markets, including the U.S., Brazil and India. Based on our well-established expertise in tower construction, we secured customer contracts to build over 3,000 towers in 2014. Meanwhile, in our African markets and in India, we developed market-leading fuel and power management solutions to improve the reliability and operating efficiency of electrical power, increasing the attractiveness of American Tower's sites to both existing and prospective tenants.
The combination of our asset quality, strong contracts, operational execution and investment discipline is borne out in our results in both the U.S. and abroad. As you can see on Slide 7, since 2011, we've posted domestic organic core growth rates averaging more than 8%. The GTP portfolio, which generated organic core growth of 10.5% in 2014, and the Verizon towers, whose revenues we expect to grow at an average annual rate of around 9% to 10% for the next 5 years, are positioned to grow faster than the rest of our domestic base for the foreseeable future.
The Verizon portfolio, in particular, is poised for strong growth due to the fact that the properties have not been actively marketed previously and have very limited exposure to churn from its existing tenant base. In fact, our sales teams are already receiving inquiries from our customers regarding the Verizon properties who've always wanted to collocate on them but never had the opportunity to do it.
In addition, we expect to convert about 85% of incremental revenues on both these portfolios into operating profit, given the minimal incremental expenses needed for collocations and amendments. The flow-through of future growth to AFFO in turn should also be very high. We expect the combination of our legacy assets and the newer GTP and Verizon portfolios to contribute meaningfully to our organic growth revenue and AFFO per share growth going forward.
By combining an attractive nationwide portfolio of assets with a strong tenant base, strategic contract structures and a focus on operational excellence, we believe that we've positioned our U.S. business to generate strong revenue and compounding cash flow growth for many years to come. We look forward to integrating the Verizon assets once the transaction closes, similar to the way we're able to outperform our integration targets for GTP. We also expect to aggressively lease up the Verizon towers beginning shortly after the close, especially given the pent-up demand that we believe exists on these franchise locations.
Turning to our international business on Slide 8, we've been able to deliver strong organic core growth over the last several years, significantly above that of the U.S. This reflects the aggressive network deployments of large multinational customers like Telefónica, MTN, Vodafone and many others across our international footprint and has been complemented by average gross margin conversion rates, excluding pass-through, of about 80% since 2010. While we continue to expect solid contributions to organic growth from existing assets, we also expect that under-marketed portfolios like Airtel Nigeria, when they're closed by us, will help generate very strong revenue growth going forward. 
The growth rates indicated on the chart for BR Towers, TIM and Airtel are the average annual revenue growth rates we expect each portfolio to generate over the next 5 years, as countries like Brazil and Nigeria accelerate the deployment of broadband mobile data. By diversifying our revenue stream internationally, focusing on large, well-funded multinational carriers and deploying capital for high-growth assets, we believe that our international segment will further elevate and extend our growth trajectory beyond that of our core business for many years to come. 
Strong organic growth across our global portfolio has helped drive rising tenancy and improving NOI yields, as you can see on Slide 9. On sites that we've actually marketed prior to 2005, we have increased the average tenancy to 2.7 tenants, resulting in $7,000 a month in revenues, excluding pass-through, and a gross margin percentage of approximately 89%. The combination of contractual escalators, amendment revenues and incremental collocations on these assets have led to an NOI yield of more than 25% on those properties. 
We've been able to replicate this kind of success on towers acquired and constructed between 2005 and 2010. The 2005 to 2010 vintage has an average of 2.3 tenants, over $4,000 in monthly revenues and a gross margin percentage of 85%, excluding pass-through, while generating an NOI yield of nearly 23%. 
Our asset additions since 2010 have primarily focused on low initial tenancy sites, which are well positioned for our teams to market for collocation. As a result, these relatively newer sites that we've added to the portfolio from 2011 to 2013 currently have an average of 1.5 tenants per tower and a current NOI yield of nearly 8.5%, leaving plenty of room for growth.
We believe that we're optimally positioned to replicate our long history of transforming low tenancy, underutilized tower portfolios into high cash flow, high-margin assets with these newer sites. This includes also -- this also implies to our recently closed acquisition of BR Towers and our pending Verizon, TIM and Airtel tower transactions. As previously highlighted, these assets all have existing capacity for incremental tenants in markets with strong wireless industry trends. As a result, we believe we've positioned ourselves to deliver a number of years of strong organic growth and the further expansion of the initial NOI yields.
Underlying all this is our ability to fund our growth initiatives with efficient and liquid sources of capital. And to that end, we launched a process to finance our Verizon transaction this morning. Meanwhile, we expect to fund our other pending acquisitions with TIM and Airtel through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our existing credit facilities and other debt financing. Our approach is designed to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, thereby positioning the company to effectively pursue the long-standing strategy that has served us and our shareholders so well today. By funding these high-growth assets in this manner, we expect to retain our investment-grade rating, while ending 2015 at a net leverage range in the mid-5s. 
In addition to collectively being accretive to AFFO per share right out of the gate, we expect these transactions in aggregate to generate substantial accretion to our AFFO per share over time. By combining our balance sheet strength with the other pillars of our corporate strategy, we have built a high-quality compounding cash flow stream with the lowest churn in the industry, a diversified customer base and exposure to the longest demand curve as a result of our high-growth international business.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our 2014 financial performance and 2015 outlook. Tom?"
24766,282864270,768605,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We finished 2014 with yet another strong quarter, achieving solid global organic core revenue growth, adding nearly 6,000 new tower assets and building on long-standing relationships with our wireless carrier customers",2488,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We finished 2014 with yet another strong quarter, achieving solid global organic core revenue growth, adding nearly 6,000 new tower assets and building on long-standing relationships with our wireless carrier customers. And as Jim just highlighted, we believe that our accomplishments over the last several years, particularly from a strategic perspective, will continue this momentum and extend our runway for growth for many, many years to come. 
If you please turn to Slide 11. We achieved strong growth in all of our key metrics in the fourth quarter. Our total rental and management revenue core growth was nearly 18%, which included another solid quarter of organic core growth at nearly 10%. Our commenced new business continued to be generated by large multinational carriers such as Verizon, Telefónica, T-Mobile and AT&T.
Domestic organic core growth was about 9%, with Verizon emerging as our top new business customer for the quarter. Internationally, we generated organic core growth of nearly 13%, with Brazil continuing to benefit from record levels of leasing demand and Ghana experiencing the highest level of organic core growth across our international markets at over 40%. We also completed the acquisition of BR Towers in Brazil in mid-November, which contributed about $11 million in revenue for the quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDA core growth was 17% and was generated primarily by our rental and management segments, which continues to drive the most profitable growth within our business. We also generated strong core AFFO growth of nearly 22% in the quarter as a result of an adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio of over 100%.
Moving on to Slide 12. We're extremely proud of the results our teams have delivered in 2014 particularly versus our initial expectations. As you can see, we have meaningfully exceeded our initial outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. While some of this outperformance was due to acquisitions, the majority of the upside was driven by better-than-expected growth on our existing sites. A significant driver of this overachievement was our ability to generate organic core revenue growth rates about 200 basis points higher than the midpoint of our initial outlook. And importantly, we were able to convert nearly 85% of our over $140 million in revenue outperformance into adjusted EBITDA and nearly 90% of that adjusted EBITDA outperformance into incremental AFFO.
Turning to Slide 13 and reviewing our full year results. Our total rental and management core revenue growth was about 28%, with more than 10% attributable to organic core growth. The remainder of the growth was driven by the over 21,000 new assets we've added since the beginning of 2013, with average tenancies of around 1.4. We commenced 30% more new business on the entire portfolio in 2014 versus 2013, reflecting the significant investments wireless carriers are making in their networks globally.
Our 2014 core adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 27%, with reported adjusted EBITDA growth of about 22%. Similar to the fourth quarter, substantially all of our adjusted EBITDA growth for the year was attributable to our rental and management segments. Despite the addition of the new lower initial tenancy assets I mentioned earlier, we maintained our adjusted EBITDA margin at nearly 65%.
Core growth and AFFO was over 27%, and almost all of that growth was attributable to our rental and management segments. Factored into that AFFO growth was an issuance of an aggregate of $1.4 billion in new senior notes at a weighted average interest rate of about 4%. We also completed a $600 million issuance of a mandatory convertible preferred stock as part of our plan to fund growth initiatives.
We ended the year with over 75,000 sites in 12 markets around the globe and have nearly 23,000 additional towers that we expect to close in the first half of 2015. Our focus on building relationships with large global tenants and carefully structuring contracts to enhance revenue visibility, while maintaining upside potential, resulted in another year of consistent, profitable growth and positions us well for 2015.
Turning to Slide 14. Our expectations for 2015 rental and management revenue growth reflect another healthy year of demand for tower space across our global footprint. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect consolidated rental and management core revenue growth of nearly 12% driven by organic core growth of about 8%, with the balance being generated from new properties, including the new sites we expect to build in 2015. We're forecasting consolidated churn of about 1.8%, which reflects the high contract renewal rates of our tenant base and the low number of contracts coming up for renewal this year. On a reported basis, we expect consolidated rental and management revenue growth of over 7% at the midpoint, including over 4% of negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a few million dollars from straight-line revenue accounting. As a reminder, none of the impacts from our pending transactions are included in these outlook numbers.
In the U.S. where we expect organic core growth of about 7%, we're forecasting commenced new business in 2015 to decline about 25% versus 2014 levels, driven by a slowdown in spending at AT&T. We've assumed that the other major carriers will be at least as active as they were in 2014. And if there is a re-acceleration of AT&T spend, there could potentially be some upside later in the year.
In 2014 by comparison, excluding the equipment decommissioning agreement we discussed previously, our initial outlook implied an organic core growth of just around 7.8%. We ended up significantly exceeding that number by year-end as a result of our ability to capitalize on higher-than-expected customer demand. As 4G densification initiatives continue to support rapid expansion in mobile data usage, we believe we're well positioned to generate solid organic core growth across our portfolio.
In our international markets, where we expect organic core growth of about 10%, we are forecasting total new business commencements to be in line with those generated in 2014. We expect our Latin American markets to have another very strong year in 2015 as carriers like Vivo in Brazil and Avantel in Colombia aggressively roll out 3 and 4G networks. African markets also are expected to perform well as large carriers like MTN and Vodafone roll out 3G across their footprints, with select 4G deployments in South Africa. Finally, we expect activity in India at roughly comparable levels to 2014, with Reliance Jio continuing to deploy 4G in urban centers and the other major carriers following suit.
Turning to Slide 15, we also expect solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO in 2015. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we're forecasting core growth of nearly 12% at the midpoint of our outlook, with reported growth of about 8%. This growth includes the impacts of an expected decrease in services operating profit of about $12 million as compared to 2014, given the conclusion of several large services projects last year.
We remain focused on property level cost controls as well as SG&A cost and expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be right around 9%, similar to 2014. In addition, our land acquisition program continues to benefit our margins with over 2% of our U.S. land expense base eliminated through prior years' land purchases. Accordingly, EBITDA margins are expected to be over 65%, and as we generate incremental new business across our portfolio of properties, we would expect our margins to continue to expand.
I just want to remind you that once our pending transactions close, due to their combined lower initial average tenancy of around 1.5 tenants per tower, our margins will temporarily decline. This does not change our long-term expectations of our ability to increase margins across the portfolio as we fully expect margin expansion on these assets once we begin actively marketing and leasing them up.
Turning to our outlook for AFFO, we expect core growth of over 13% at the midpoint, which will be driven by the growth in adjusted EBITDA net of interest costs associated with our 2014 acquisitions as well as slightly higher maintenance CapEx assumptions due to our larger asset portfolio. We expect all of our growth in AFFO to be generated by our rental and management segments. At the midpoint of outlook and assuming a weighted average diluted share count of just over 400 million shares, our outlook midpoint for AFFO per share will be around $4.91.
Moving on to Slide 16. In 2015, consistent with the last several years, we expect our primary method of returning capital to stockholders will be through our REIT distribution. The amounts and timing of our dividend payments are at the discretion of our board, but our goal continues to be deliver -- to deliver annual dividend growth of over 20%.
We currently plan to spend between $800 million and $900 million in CapEx during the year, which includes the construction of about 3,000 sites at the midpoint, including around 150 to 250 sites in the U.S. Given our pending transactions in the U.S., Brazil and Nigeria and our global construction pipeline, we anticipate having about 100,000 sites by year-end. We also expect to spend about $180 million on land acquisitions while also targeting to opportunistically extend over 2,500 leases domestically. Pro forma for the Verizon transaction, we expect to have over 60% of the land under our domestic sites owned or under our control for 20 years or more. 
Finally, we continue to maintain an active deal pipeline and continue evaluating acquisition opportunities around the world. Our capital allocation priorities in 2015 will continue to support our corporate strategy of growing our asset base profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 17. We remain focused on strategically and opportunistically expanding our global business. This is reflected in the nearly 23,000 towers we expect to add to our portfolio through 3 transactions in the first half of this year. Our recently announced Verizon deal will enable us to add nearly 11,500 towers to our U.S. asset base while meaningfully expanding our relationship with a very high quality investment-grade tenant. As Jim noted earlier, we think this is an excellent portfolio of historically under-marketed, under-leased towers that are well positioned to generate significant organic core growth for an extended period of time. We believe that this portfolio will generate compounded annual growth in revenue over the next 5 years of between 9% and 10% and will help us extend our organic growth trajectory in the U.S. We expect to close the Verizon transaction by the end of the first quarter.
We expect to close our previously announced transaction in Nigeria with Airtel in the first half of the year, which will allow us to commence operations in our newest high-growth international market. By acquiring about 4,800 sites from Airtel, we will gain meaningful scale in a country which has the largest economy in Africa, with a fast-growing wireless sector and an extremely young, extremely mobile population with virtually no fixed line infrastructure in place. Similar to Ghana and Uganda, which generated organic core revenue growth of nearly 30% in 2014, we would expect these Nigerian sites to generate strong growth going forward to support our required high teen to low 20% unlevered returns.
And finally, we expect to acquire about 6,500 sites in Brazil from Telecom Italia, also in the first half of the year, which will bring our portfolio in the country to over 18,000 towers. Brazil has been one of our fastest-growing markets over the last several years, and organic core revenue growth in 2014 was over 19%. Given the current state of network infrastructure in Brazil, we believe that our customers will need to continue to make significant investments in their mobile networks. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from this, given our strategically located footprint. With a 20-year anchor lease with TIM on this portfolio and significant opportunities for organic leasing growth, we expect Brazil to be a key growth driver for our business going forward.
As a reminder, and as I've said, we have not included any impacts from these pending transactions in our current outlook for 2015. On an annualized year 1 basis, we would expect the portfolios to collectively generate revenues of around $815 million and gross margin of about $390 million. In addition, we expect them to collectively be modestly accretive to AFFO per share in their first full year and increasingly accretive thereafter.
Pro forma for these transactions, we expect to have nearly $34 billion in noncancelable revenues, representing over 8x pro forma 2014 revenue. With an average pro forma remaining lease term of nearly 7 years, we have a solid foundation on which to drive incremental revenue and cash flow for many years to come.
Moving on to Slide 18. Our pending transactions reflect the continuation of our long history of prudent capital deployment. As you can see on these charts, from 2007 to the midpoint of the 2015 outlook we issued this morning, we will have recorded annual growth rates in rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO of at least 14%, with growth in AFFO per share at nearly 16%. We have also simultaneously increased our return on invested capital, attained an investment-grade credit rating and have grown the company from just over 20,000 sites to a pro forma total of nearly 100,000 towers, creating the most comprehensive and diversified, independently operated global network of towers in the world. As a result, we believe that we have positioned the business to continue to deliver consistent recurring cash flow-based growth while generating compelling total returns for our stockholders.
On Slide 19 and in conclusion, we had another strong year in 2014, with core growth in rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO all over 27% and organic core growth of more than 10%. Given the ever-increasing global demand for wireless services in our diverse portfolio, we expect another very solid year of profitable growth in 2015. By combining our high-quality legacy asset base with the more than 27,000 previously underutilized, under-marketed sites we will be adding through recently closed and pending transactions, we expect to extend our organic growth profile and enhance our ability to drive strong growth in AFFO per share over the long term. We believe that our continuing focus on operational excellence, coupled with select strategic investments, solidifies our status as a premier global owner and operator of communications real estate.
And finally, as Leah mentioned right upfront, I do want to remind you that we have begun our efforts to finance our Verizon transaction. Under federal securities rules, we are limited in our ability to discuss the financing on this call. We ask that you please refer to our filings we have made this morning with the SEC for additional information.

And since you announced the acquisition, what type of feedback have you received from some of your customers that sort of further solidifies that growth outlook?"

This set of Verizon towers fits",572,"First, Amir, our track record of converting nonperforming assets, they're essentially single use by mobile operators into performing assets by commercially leasing them, is pretty clear and we outlined those in the remarks. This set of Verizon towers fits exactly into that category. It's an asset that the previous owner had used to build its own network to try to get leadership in that space in the United States and wasn't necessarily focused on marketing those sites to gain lease revenue from other carriers or competitors, frankly. 
One just sort of specific item of evidence that indicates that we believe the towers are quite largely under-marketed is that unlike other companies in the mobile operator space in the U.S., Verizon never established, to our knowledge, an internal tower business to go out and find lessees for these sites, process applications, generate business, et cetera. Other tower portfolios that have traded in the last few years, again, it's our understanding that those organizations did exist in those companies and, therefore, the initial lease rates when those assets traded were significantly higher than the Verizon asset that we've disclosed. 
So we think there's a lot of pent-up demand right off the bat, to answer your question, Amir. So that's the demand side of things. And our customers as I said, are already making inquiries into our sales and marketing team to get on many of these sites. They weren't necessarily in the view of those other customers available to them. And Verizon, frankly, wasn't set up to effectively and quickly process applications and get them up on the towers. Our tenant base knows that's exactly our objective here, so they've already expressed interest. So that's -- really fills out the demand side of the equation on these sites for us. 
On the supply side, as we call it, the towers have, what I call, distinctive characteristics as far as height, as far as structural integrity. And our view is that this is a unique portfolio and that we expect it to have, on average, one available tenant structural capacity unit without any investment in redevelopment for that. So this is a very high capacity portfolio with, again, we think distinctively sizable ground space under the tower that will enable us to put additional equipment for other customers there without necessarily having to expand the compound and getting additional land rights and paying for those. So both the demand side of the Verizon asset and the supply side, we think, are distinctively strong. 
And the other thing that I do want to highlight is the Verizon operations team managed these assets in a manner that we would consider quite close to the way we would manage these assets in terms of documentation, in terms of maintenance. Just as a key example, the speed at which you can, when you're a tower company, lease-up sites is in large part initially dependent on the completeness of the -- literally the file that comes with the tower, things like ground leases, environmental studies, documentation on zoning and building permits and things like that. Because when you go to lease that site to another customer, they're going to want to have all that material. We feel that again, this is a distinctive portfolio in terms of the documentation that comes right with the tower. So those are some of the demand-and-supply side benefits we think to this particular portfolio."

In terms of the fit with our existing base, nearly 50% of the sites have no competing structures within a mile, and they're very well located sites for a potential public safety rollout. Many of the locations are in less urban areas. There's no alternative structures available. And given the -- kind of the model that we've laid out, we're really only talking about adding one additional tenant per tower on average over the entire 10-year period. 
The other element is given their low tenancy, 1.4 tenants per tower, there's expected to be very little churn on these. Obviously, we have the anchor tenant of Verizon, and the other third-party leasing activity are the other big 3 leasing companies. So we would expect to have very, very little churn going forward on this portfolio. So I think when you couple all of that, you would -- you conclude that the 9% to 10% is very achievable from our perspective."

And that's an important point that I want to also highlight, that the non-Verizon towers in the American Tower portfolio, non-V",630,"Sure. So let's start with the U.S. Our largest volume of signed business right now in the U.S. is actually coming from Verizon. And that's an important point that I want to also highlight, that the non-Verizon towers in the American Tower portfolio, non-Verizon transaction towers, is 75% of our U.S. portfolio roughly. So of the 40,000-plus sites, only 11.5 thousand are the Verizon towers pro forma, so there's plenty of places for Verizon to grow into with us. 
Just a further fact on that, the Verizon revenue that are on legacy ATC non-Verizon transaction towers is about 60%. So 60% of Verizon's pro forma revenue with us is going to continue to come on non-deal towers. Therefore, there's going to be nice amendment opportunity on over half that revenue base. So Verizon investing aggressively in its network going forward is going to actually be very helpful to our growth rate and could contribute to that 7% number that you pointed out there, Armintas. 
AT&T is still going to be very active. But as a comparison to last year, 2014 was the most active year that we have seen from our perspective with AT&T since I've been at the company. It was an outsized, probably a record year for them for mobile spending. And this year, 2015, is a more normalized year for AT&T and also still robust. So we expect new business from them as well. 
But we also see the number 2 application flow coming after Verizon from T-Mobile. So T-Mobile is actually increasing, in our view, its activity level in the network based on some projects that it has going. And then Sprint is continuing to work through 2.5 gigahertz and some other projects it has. So that's sort of the batting order for U.S. application flow right now, is Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint. Then turning to the international market of Brazil, which is our most significant pro forma international market in terms of revenue. We're seeing -- expecting 19% core organic growth -- or we just reported in 2014, we could say that now. So really high-growth market for this asset base, one of the things that encouraged us to add to the asset base going forward, which we've done with BRT and now TIM. 
As far as Brazil goes, you pointed out 2 of the most important factors, I think. One is the run-up to the Olympics; and secondly is the 700 megahertz 4G auction and rollout that's going on. But I also wanted to cross-connect from the opposite direction all of Latin America by customers. 
So Telefónica, we expect to be extremely active in Brazil as well as Mexico. It's investing across Latin America in 3G deployment. As a corporation, I think Telefónica wants to increase its competitiveness throughout Latin America in mobile data. And Brazil and Mexico are the 2 biggest target markets, simply based on their size for that, but it's going to be elsewhere. 
Also the run-up to the Olympics is going to be demanding investments by all 4 carriers, and TIM is included in that as well as Claro, which is the AMX subsidiary. So we really feel that Brazil is going to continue to be a high-growth market for us. Of course, that contributed to our decisions to invest and upsize our scale to about 18,000 sites pro forma for the deal. 
And finally, on the M&A front, we don't speculate on potential deals. It's always fluid. But we are still in the market, and we're going to continue to apply our disciplined investment approach to fill in -- especially in existing countries we have or with existing customers we have opportunities that may come available. But we don't have anything specific to point to at the moment."

And then related to that, just wanted to touch on Slide 9. I don't think I've seen this slide before. I apologize if you have done it. But for Verizon, projected NOI yield for year 1 and year 5, can you just walk us through? It would seem, given the upside for the Verizon towers, the 7% in year 5 might be a little bit light. But can you kind of walk us through your assumptions and help us understand that?"

So I think that's really reflective of kind of the 7% NOI yield going forward. 
And as Jim identified before, we build our growth profile for all of our transactions from the ground up. And our sales teams within the United States are incredibly excited about this opportunity. We get search rings in from all of our carriers every day, who are identifying areas where, in fact, they need RF coverage. And so that gives us the comfort and the credibility, we believe, of the pent-up demand and the growth that we expect to see in this portfolio."

But just as a reference point, in our guidance, we have about 150 this year. 
So there was a lot of building last year specifically in this market. Hopefully, we can channel some of that to Verizon towers in the future, because they'll now be available on our process and on our contracts. So that's one way. 
The other way is you just don't put the cell site out there or you put it in a sub-optimal location. And all of those are poor engineering decisions or financial decisions than collocating on an extremely well-positioned tower with good capacity and ground space, which is what we're going to be offering."

Our rental and management segments generated over $4 billion in revenue for the first time in our company's history and delivered double-digit growth across all of our key metrics, including organic core revenue, rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share. The cash flow generation of our legacy assets combined with our disciplined approach to inorganic growth also enabled ATC to sustain return on invested capital at the 10% level.
Last quarter during my prepared remarks, I highlighted the industry trends that are developing across our served markets. Today, I'm going to review American Tower's long-standing fundamental strategy and provide segment performance data that clearly demonstrates the sustainable performance being delivered by the execution of that strategy.
Turning to Slide 5. When I came to American Tower nearly 14 years ago, we established a 3-pronged strategy for our business. Those 3 strategic pillars have not changed and they include:
One, to focus on operational excellence. We strive to further expand our leasing revenue opportunity by understanding our tenants' needs and satisfying them through our unique expertise in lease contracting. We then design our business processes to minimize cycle times and deliver superior capabilities in areas, such as tower construction and power and fuel management, to achieve a preferred supplier position with each of our customers.
Two, to maximize the compounding growth in cash flow that's generated from our existing properties, while selectively growing our asset base. We focused on driving organic growth, maintaining stringent cost controls and simultaneously investing in assets around the world, but only those that meet our investment criteria. And three, to maintain a strong balance sheet, to ensure we have a consistent access to capital markets at attractive rates in all market conditions to fuel our largest strategy.
Our ability to execute our strategic goals has led to total return outperformance versus the S&P 500 in 9 of the last 10 years and a cumulative total return, including REIT dividends, of nearly 500% to our stockholders since 2005. In that time frame, we've grown the company from a primarily domestic U.S. communications real estate provider with about 22,000 towers, to a global leader in the industry with nearly 100,000 sites, counting our pending transactions with Verizon, Telecom Italia and Airtel. With a current enterprise value of over $51 billion today compared to $7 billion 10 years ago, we've not only established global scale but have also positioned American Tower as a credible and reliable partner to many of the world's leading multinational mobile operators.
As outlined on Slide 6, the bedrock of our major tenant partnerships are master lease agreements that leverage our scale to encourage additional revenue, while introducing process efficiency, both to our own company and to our clients. Among the most effective of these contracts are the holistic contract structures that we have with 3 of the national carriers in the United States, which has significantly improved our revenue growth visibility while minimizing churn. As a result of this contract structure and pro forma for our pending acquisitions, we will have nearly $34 billion of noncancelable revenue or about 8x our 2014 revenues on the books.
We've also created a culture of operational excellence throughout this organization, pushing cycle times lower and our customers' speed-to-market faster, all to support an improved customer experience that we hope further drives incremental revenue. Our aim is to make the collocation and amendment process as efficient as possible by aligning our processes and procedures with those of our customers. Since 2010, for example, we reduced our average cycle time for collocations for customers with holistic MLAs by 50%.
In another key operational area, tower construction, we demonstrated leadership and earning build-to-suit contracts in major markets, including the U.S., Brazil and India. Based on our well-established expertise in tower construction, we secured customer contracts to build over 3,000 towers in 2014. Meanwhile, in our African markets and in India, we developed market-leading fuel and power management solutions to improve the reliability and operating efficiency of electrical power, increasing the attractiveness of American Tower's sites to both existing and prospective tenants.
The combination of our asset quality, strong contracts, operational execution and investment discipline is borne out in our results in both the U.S. and abroad. As you can see on Slide 7, since 2011, we've posted domestic organic core growth rates averaging more than 8%. The GTP portfolio, which generated organic core growth of 10.5% in 2014, and the Verizon towers, whose revenues we expect to grow at an average annual rate of around 9% to 10% for the next 5 years, are positioned to grow faster than the rest of our domestic base for the foreseeable future.
The Verizon portfolio, in particular, is poised for strong growth due to the fact that the properties have not been actively marketed previously and have very limited exposure to churn from its existing tenant base. In fact, our sales teams are already receiving inquiries from our customers regarding the Verizon properties who've always wanted to collocate on them but never had the opportunity to do it.
In addition, we expect to convert about 85% of incremental revenues on both these portfolios into operating profit, given the minimal incremental expenses needed for collocations and amendments. The flow-through of future growth to AFFO in turn should also be very high. We expect the combination of our legacy assets and the newer GTP and Verizon portfolios to contribute meaningfully to our organic growth revenue and AFFO per share growth going forward.
By combining an attractive nationwide portfolio of assets with a strong tenant base, strategic contract structures and a focus on operational excellence, we believe that we've positioned our U.S. business to generate strong revenue and compounding cash flow growth for many years to come. We look forward to integrating the Verizon assets once the transaction closes, similar to the way we're able to outperform our integration targets for GTP. We also expect to aggressively lease up the Verizon towers beginning shortly after the close, especially given the pent-up demand that we believe exists on these franchise locations.
Turning to our international business on Slide 8, we've been able to deliver strong organic core growth over the last several years, significantly above that of the U.S. This reflects the aggressive network deployments of large multinational customers like Telefónica, MTN, Vodafone and many others across our international footprint and has been complemented by average gross margin conversion rates, excluding pass-through, of about 80% since 2010. While we continue to expect solid contributions to organic growth from existing assets, we also expect that under-marketed portfolios like Airtel Nigeria, when they're closed by us, will help generate very strong revenue growth going forward. 
The growth rates indicated on the chart for BR Towers, TIM and Airtel are the average annual revenue growth rates we expect each portfolio to generate over the next 5 years, as countries like Brazil and Nigeria accelerate the deployment of broadband mobile data. By diversifying our revenue stream internationally, focusing on large, well-funded multinational carriers and deploying capital for high-growth assets, we believe that our international segment will further elevate and extend our growth trajectory beyond that of our core business for many years to come. 
Strong organic growth across our global portfolio has helped drive rising tenancy and improving NOI yields, as you can see on Slide 9. On sites that we've actually marketed prior to 2005, we have increased the average tenancy to 2.7 tenants, resulting in $7,000 a month in revenues, excluding pass-through, and a gross margin percentage of approximately 89%. The combination of contractual escalators, amendment revenues and incremental collocations on these assets have led to an NOI yield of more than 25% on those properties. 
We've been able to replicate this kind of success on towers acquired and constructed between 2005 and 2010. The 2005 to 2010 vintage has an average of 2.3 tenants, over $4,000 in monthly revenues and a gross margin percentage of 85%, excluding pass-through, while generating an NOI yield of nearly 23%. 
Our asset additions since 2010 have primarily focused on low initial tenancy sites, which are well positioned for our teams to market for collocation. As a result, these relatively newer sites that we've added to the portfolio from 2011 to 2013 currently have an average of 1.5 tenants per tower and a current NOI yield of nearly 8.5%, leaving plenty of room for growth.
We believe that we're optimally positioned to replicate our long history of transforming low tenancy, underutilized tower portfolios into high cash flow, high-margin assets with these newer sites. This includes also -- this also implies to our recently closed acquisition of BR Towers and our pending Verizon, TIM and Airtel tower transactions. As previously highlighted, these assets all have existing capacity for incremental tenants in markets with strong wireless industry trends. As a result, we believe we've positioned ourselves to deliver a number of years of strong organic growth and the further expansion of the initial NOI yields.
Underlying all this is our ability to fund our growth initiatives with efficient and liquid sources of capital. And to that end, we launched a process to finance our Verizon transaction this morning. Meanwhile, we expect to fund our other pending acquisitions with TIM and Airtel through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our existing credit facilities and other debt financing. Our approach is designed to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, thereby positioning the company to effectively pursue the long-standing strategy that has served us and our shareholders so well to date. By funding these high-growth assets in this manner, we expect to retain our investment-grade rating, while ending 2015 at a net leverage range in the mid-5s. 
In addition to collectively being accretive to AFFO per share right out of the gate, we expect these transactions in aggregate to generate substantial accretion to our AFFO per share over time. By combining our balance sheet strength with the other pillars of our corporate strategy, we have built a high-quality compounding cash flow stream with the lowest churn in the industry, a diversified customer base and exposure to the longest demand curve as a result of our high-growth international business.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our 2014 financial performance and 2015 outlook. Tom?"

Good morning, everyone. We finished 2014 with yet another strong quarter, achieving solid global organic core revenue growth, adding nearly 6,000 new tower assets and building on long-standing relationships with our wireless carrier customers",2489,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We finished 2014 with yet another strong quarter, achieving solid global organic core revenue growth, adding nearly 6,000 new tower assets and building on long-standing relationships with our wireless carrier customers. And as Jim just highlighted, we believe that our accomplishments over the last several years, particularly from a strategic perspective, will continue this momentum and extend our runway for growth for many, many years to come. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 11. We achieved strong growth in all of our key metrics in the fourth quarter. Our total rental and management revenue core growth was nearly 18%, which included another solid quarter of organic core growth at nearly 10%. Our commenced new business continued to be generated by large multinational carriers such as Verizon, Telefónica, T-Mobile and AT&T.
Domestic organic core growth was about 9%, with Verizon emerging as our top new business customer for the quarter. Internationally, we generated organic core growth of nearly 13%, with Brazil continuing to benefit from record levels of leasing demand and Ghana experiencing the highest level of organic core growth across our international markets at over 40%. We also completed the acquisition of BR Towers in Brazil in mid-November, which contributed about $11 million in revenue for the quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDA core growth was 17% and was generated primarily by our rental and management segments, which continues to drive the most profitable growth within our business. We also generated strong core AFFO growth of nearly 22% in the quarter as a result of an adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio of over 100%.
Moving on to Slide 12. We're extremely proud of the results our teams have delivered in 2014 particularly versus our initial expectations. As you can see, we have meaningfully exceeded our initial outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. While some of this outperformance was due to acquisitions, the majority of the upside was driven by better-than-expected growth on our existing sites. A significant driver of this overachievement was our ability to generate organic core revenue growth rates about 200 basis points higher than the midpoint of our initial outlook. And importantly, we were able to convert nearly 85% of our over $140 million in revenue outperformance into adjusted EBITDA and nearly 90% of that adjusted EBITDA outperformance into incremental AFFO.
Turning to Slide 13 and reviewing our full year results. Our total rental and management core revenue growth was about 28%, with more than 10% attributable to organic core growth. The remainder of the growth was driven by the over 21,000 new assets we've added since the beginning of 2013, with average tenancies of around 1.4. We commenced 30% more new business on the entire portfolio in 2014 versus 2013, reflecting the significant investments wireless carriers are making in their networks globally.
Our 2014 core adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 27%, with reported adjusted EBITDA growth of about 22%. Similar to the fourth quarter, substantially all of our adjusted EBITDA growth for the year was attributable to our rental and management segments. Despite the addition of the new lower initial tenancy assets I mentioned earlier, we maintained our adjusted EBITDA margin at nearly 65%.
Core growth and AFFO was over 27%, and almost all of that growth was attributable to our rental and management segments. Factored into that AFFO growth was an issuance of an aggregate of $1.4 billion in new senior notes at a weighted average interest rate of about 4%. We also completed a $600 million issuance of a mandatory convertible preferred stock as part of our plan to fund growth initiatives.
We ended the year with over 75,000 sites in 12 markets around the globe and have nearly 23,000 additional towers that we expect to close in the first half of 2015. Our focus on building relationships with large global tenants and carefully structuring contracts to enhance revenue visibility, while maintaining upside potential, resulted in another year of consistent, profitable growth and positions us well for 2015.
Turning to Slide 14. Our expectations for 2015 rental and management revenue growth reflect another healthy year of demand for tower space across our global footprint. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect consolidated rental and management core revenue growth of nearly 12% driven by organic core growth of about 8%, with the balance being generated from new properties, including the new sites we expect to build in 2015. We're forecasting consolidated churn of about 1.8%, which reflects the high contract renewal rates of our tenant base and the low number of contracts coming up for renewal this year. On a reported basis, we expect consolidated rental and management revenue growth of over 7% at the midpoint, including over 4% of negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a few million dollars from straight-line revenue accounting. As a reminder, none of the impacts from our pending transactions are included in these outlook numbers.
In the U.S. where we expect organic core growth of about 7%, we're forecasting commenced new business in 2015 to decline about 25% versus 2014 levels, driven by a slowdown in spending at AT&T. We've assumed that the other major carriers will be at least as active as they were in 2014. And if there is a re-acceleration of AT&T spend, there could potentially be some upside later in the year.
In 2014 by comparison, excluding the equipment decommissioning agreement we've discussed previously, our initial outlook implied an organic core growth of just around 7.8%. We ended up significantly exceeding that number by year-end as a result of our ability to capitalize on higher-than-expected customer demand. As 4G densification initiatives continue to support rapid expansion in mobile data usage, we believe we're well positioned to generate solid organic core growth across our portfolio.
In our international markets, where we expect organic core growth of about 10%, we are forecasting total new business commencements to be in line with those generated in 2014. We expect our Latin American markets to have another very strong year in 2015 as carriers like Vivo in Brazil and Avantel in Colombia aggressively roll out 3 and 4G networks. African markets also are expected to perform well as large carriers like MTN and Vodafone roll out 3G across their footprints, with select 4G deployments in South Africa. Finally, we expect activity in India at roughly comparable levels to 2014, with Reliance Jio continuing to deploy 4G in urban centers and the other major carriers following suit.
Turning to Slide 15, we also expect solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO in 2015. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we're forecasting core growth of nearly 12% at the midpoint of our outlook, with reported growth of about 8%. This growth includes the impacts of an expected decrease in services operating profit of about $12 million as compared to 2014, given the conclusion of several large services projects last year.
We remain focused on property level cost controls as well as the SG&A costs and expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be right around 9%, similar to 2014. In addition, our land acquisition program continues to benefit our margins with over 2% of our U.S. land expense base eliminated through prior years' land purchases. Accordingly, EBITDA margins are expected to be over 65%, and as we generate incremental new business across our portfolio of properties, we would expect our margins to continue to expand.
I just want to remind you that once our pending transactions close, due to their combined lower initial average tenancy of around 1.5 tenants per tower, our margins will temporarily decline. This does not change our long-term expectations of our ability to increase margins across the portfolio as we fully expect margin expansion on these assets once we begin actively marketing and leasing them up.
Turning to our outlook for AFFO, we expect core growth of over 13% at the midpoint, which will be driven by the growth in adjusted EBITDA net of interest costs associated with our 2014 acquisitions as well as slightly higher maintenance CapEx assumptions due to our larger asset portfolio. We expect all of our growth in AFFO to be generated by our rental and management segments. At the midpoint of outlook and assuming a weighted average diluted share count of just over 400 million shares, our outlook midpoint for AFFO per share will be around $4.91.
Moving on to Slide 16. In 2015, consistent with the last several years, we expect our primary method of returning capital to stockholders will be through our REIT distribution. The amounts and timing of our dividend payments are at the discretion of our board, but our goal continues to be deliver -- to deliver annual dividend growth of over 20%.
We currently plan to spend between $800 million and $900 million in CapEx during the year, which includes the construction of about 3,000 sites at the midpoint, including around 150 to 250 sites in the U.S. Given our pending transactions in the U.S., Brazil and Nigeria and our global construction pipeline, we anticipate having about 100,000 sites by year-end. We also expect to spend about $180 million on land acquisitions while also targeting to opportunistically extend over 2,500 leases domestically. Pro forma for the Verizon transaction, we expect to have over 60% of the land under our domestic sites owned or under our control for 20 years or more. 
Finally, we continue to maintain an active deal pipeline and continue evaluating acquisition opportunities around the world. Our capital allocation priorities in 2015 will continue to support our corporate strategy of growing our asset base profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 17. We remain focused on strategically and opportunistically expanding our global business. This is reflected in the nearly 23,000 towers we expect to add to our portfolio through 3 transactions in the first half of this year. Our recently announced Verizon deal will enable us to add nearly 11,500 towers to our U.S. asset base while meaningfully expanding our relationship with a very high quality investment-grade tenant. As Jim noted earlier, we think this is an excellent portfolio of historically under-marketed, under-leased towers that are well positioned to generate significant organic core growth for an extended period of time. We believe that this portfolio will generate compounded annual growth in revenue over the next 5 years of between 9% and 10% and will help us extend our organic growth trajectory in the U.S. We expect to close the Verizon transaction by the end of the first quarter.
We expect to close our previously announced transaction in Nigeria with Airtel in the first half of the year, which will allow us to commence operations in our newest high-growth international market. By acquiring about 4,800 sites from Airtel, we will gain meaningful scale in a country which has the largest economy in Africa, with a fast-growing wireless sector and an extremely young, extremely mobile population with virtually no fixed line infrastructure in place. Similar to Ghana and Uganda, which generated organic core revenue growth of nearly 30% in 2014, we would expect these Nigerian sites to generate strong growth going forward to support our required high teen to low 20% unlevered returns.
And finally, we expect to acquire about 6,500 sites in Brazil from Telecom Italia, also in the first half of the year, which will bring our portfolio in the country to over 18,000 towers. Brazil has been one of our fastest-growing markets over the last several years, and organic core revenue growth in 2014 was over 19%. Given the current state of network infrastructure in Brazil, we believe that our customers will need to continue to make significant investments in their mobile networks. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from this, given our strategically located footprint. With a 20-year anchor lease with TIM on this portfolio and significant opportunities for organic leasing growth, we expect Brazil to be a key growth driver for our business going forward.
As a reminder, and as I've said, we have not included any impacts from these pending transactions in our current outlook for 2015. On an annualized year 1 basis, we would expect the portfolios to collectively generate revenues of around $815 million and gross margin of about $390 million. In addition, we expect them to collectively be modestly accretive to AFFO per share in their first full year and increasingly accretive thereafter.
Pro forma for these transactions, we expect to have nearly $34 billion in noncancelable revenues, representing over 8x pro forma 2014 revenue. With an average pro forma remaining lease term of nearly 7 years, we have a solid foundation on which to drive incremental revenue and cash flow for many years to come.
Moving on to Slide 18. Our pending transactions reflect the continuation of our long history of prudent capital deployment. As you can see on these charts, from 2007 to the midpoint of the 2015 outlook we issued this morning, we will have recorded annual growth rates in rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO of at least 14%, with growth in AFFO per share at nearly 16%. We have also simultaneously increased our return on invested capital, attained an investment-grade credit rating and have grown the company from just over 20,000 sites to a pro forma total of nearly 100,000 towers, creating the most comprehensive and diversified, independently operated global network of towers in the world. As a result, we believe that we have positioned the business to continue to deliver consistent recurring cash flow-based growth while generating compelling total returns for our stockholders.
On Slide 19 and in conclusion, we had another strong year in 2014, with core growth in rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO all over 27% and organic core growth of more than 10%. Given the ever-increasing global demand for wireless services in our diverse portfolio, we expect another very solid year of profitable growth in 2015. By combining our high-quality legacy asset base with the more than 27,000 previously underutilized, under-marketed sites we will be adding through recently closed and pending transactions, we expect to extend our organic growth profile and enhance our ability to drive strong growth in AFFO per share over the long term. We believe that our continuing focus on operational excellence, coupled with select strategic investments, solidifies our status as a premier global owner and operator of communications real estate.
And finally, as Leah mentioned right upfront, I do want to remind you that we have begun our efforts to finance our Verizon transaction. Under federal securities rules, we are limited in our ability to discuss the financing on this call. We ask that you please refer to our filings we have made this morning with the SEC for additional information.
And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

24766,282864270,768906,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","First, Amir, our track record of converting nonperforming assets, that are essentially single use by mobile operators into performing assets by commercially leasing them, is pretty clear and we outlined those in the remarks. This set of Verizon towers fit",573,"First, Amir, our track record of converting nonperforming assets, that are essentially single use by mobile operators into performing assets by commercially leasing them, is pretty clear and we outlined those in the remarks. This set of Verizon towers fits exactly into that category. It's an asset that the previous owner had used to build its own network to try to get leadership in that space in the United States and wasn't necessarily focused on marketing those sites to gain lease revenue from other carriers or competitors, frankly. 
One just sort of specific item of evidence that indicates that we believe the towers are quite largely under-marketed is that unlike other companies in the mobile operator space in the U.S., Verizon never established, to our knowledge, an internal tower business to go out and find lessees for these sites, process applications, generate business, et cetera. Other tower portfolios that have traded in the last few years, again, it's our understanding that those organizations did exist in those companies and, therefore, the initial lease rates when those assets traded were significantly higher than the Verizon asset that we've disclosed. 
So we think there's a lot of pent-up demand right off the bat, to answer your question, Amir. So that's the demand side of things. And our customers as I said, are already making inquiries into our sales and marketing team to get on many of these sites. They weren't necessarily, in the view of those other customers, available to them. And Verizon, frankly, wasn't set up to effectively and quickly process applications and get them up on the towers. Our tenant base knows that's exactly our objective here, so they've already expressed interest. So that's -- really fills out the demand side of the equation on these sites for us. 
On the supply side, as we call it, the towers have, what I call, distinctive characteristics as far as height, as far as structural integrity. And our view is that this is a unique portfolio and that we expect it to have, on average, one available tenant structural capacity unit without any investment in redevelopment for that. So this is a very high capacity portfolio with, again, we think distinctively sizable ground space under the tower that will enable us to put additional equipment for other customers there without necessarily having to expand the compound and getting additional land rights and paying for those. So both the demand side of the Verizon asset and the supply side, we think, are distinctively strong. 
And the other thing that I do want to highlight is the Verizon operations team managed these assets in a manner that we would consider quite close to the way we would manage these assets in terms of documentation, in terms of maintenance. Just as a key example, the speed at which you can, when you're a tower company, lease-up sites is in large part initially dependent on the completeness of the -- literally the file that comes with the tower, things like ground leases, environmental studies, documentation on zoning and building permits and things like that. Because when you go to lease that site to another customer, they're going to want to have all that material. We feel that again, this is a distinctive portfolio in terms of the documentation that comes right with the tower. So those are some of the demand-and-supply side benefits we think to this particular portfolio."

In terms of the fit with our existing base, nearly 50% of the sites have no competing structures within a mile, and they're very well located sites for a potential public safety rollout. Many of the locations are in less urban areas. There's no alternative structures available. And given the -- kind of the model that we've laid out, we're really only talking about adding one additional tenant per tower on average over the entire 10-year period. 
The other element is given their low tenancy, 1.4 tenants per tower, there's expected to be very little churn on these. Obviously, we have the anchor tenant of Verizon, and the other third-party leasing activity are the other big 3 leasing companies. So we would expect to have very, very little churn going forward on this portfolio. So I think when you couple all of that, you would -- you conclude that the 9% to 10% is very achievable from our perspective."

So let's start with the U.S. Our largest volume of signed business right now in the U.S. is actually coming from Verizon. And that's an important point that I want to also highlight, that the non-Verizon towers in the American Tower portfolio, non-V",631,"Sure. So let's start with the U.S. Our largest volume of signed business right now in the U.S. is actually coming from Verizon. And that's an important point that I want to also highlight, that the non-Verizon towers in the American Tower portfolio, non-Verizon transaction towers, is 75% of our U.S. portfolio roughly. So of the 40,000-plus sites, only 11.5 thousand are the Verizon towers pro forma, so there's plenty of places for Verizon to grow into with us. 
Just a further fact on that, the Verizon revenue that are on legacy ATC non-Verizon transaction towers is about 60%. So 60% of Verizon's pro forma revenue with us is going to continue to come on non-deal towers. Therefore, there's going to be nice amendment opportunity on over half that revenue base. So Verizon investing aggressively in its network going forward is going to actually be very helpful to our growth rate and could contribute to that 7% number that you pointed out there, Armintas. 
AT&T is still going to be very active. But as a comparison to last year, 2014 was the most active year that we have seen from our perspective with AT&T since I've been at the company. It was an outsized, probably a record year for them for mobile spending. And this year, 2015, is a more normalized year for AT&T and also still robust. So we expect new business from them as well. 
But we also see the number 2 application flow coming after Verizon from T-Mobile. So T-Mobile is actually increasing, in our view, its activity level in the network based on some projects that it has going. And then Sprint is continuing to work through 2.5 gigahertz and some other projects it has. So that's sort of the batting order for U.S. application flow right now, is Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint. Then turning to the international market of Brazil, which is our most significant pro forma international market in terms of revenue. We're seeing -- expecting 19% core organic growth -- or we just reported it in 2014, we could say that now. So really high-growth market for this asset base, one of the things that encouraged us to add to the asset base going forward, which we've done with BRT and now TIM. 
As far as Brazil goes, you pointed out 2 of the most important factors, I think. One is the run-up to the Olympics; and secondly is the 700 megahertz 4G auction and rollout that's going on. But I also wanted to cross-connect from the opposite direction all of Latin America by customers. 
So Telefónica, we expect to be extremely active in Brazil as well as Mexico. It's investing across Latin America in 3G deployment. As a corporation, I think Telefónica wants to increase its competitiveness throughout Latin America in mobile data. And Brazil and Mexico are the 2 biggest target markets, simply based on their size for that, but it's going to be elsewhere. 
Also the run-up to the Olympics is going to be demanding investments by all 4 carriers, and TIM is included in that as well as Claro, which is the AMX subsidiary. So we really feel that Brazil is going to continue to be a high-growth market for us. Of course, that contributed to our decisions to invest and upsize our scale to about 18,000 sites pro forma for the deal. 
And finally, on the M&A front, we don't speculate on potential deals. It's always fluid. But we are still in the market, and we're going to continue to apply our disciplined investment approach to fill in -- especially in existing countries we have or with existing customers we have opportunities that may come available. But we don't have anything specific to point to at the moment."

So we're reflecting what we're currently seeing in the application pipeline for our major customers. If that was to move up during the course of the year, we'll adjust our guidance. But we don't do it until we see it and it's too early at this particular case with AT&T to see it. So we're not making any prediction of a ramp-up. That might be more in sync with what the numbers that you laid out."

And then related to that, just wanted to touch on Slide 9. I don't think I've seen this slide before. I apologize if you have done it. But for Verizon, projected NOI yield for year 1 and year 5, can you just walk us through? It would seem, given the upside for the Verizon towers, the 7% in year 5 might be a little bit light.

So I think that's really reflective of kind of the 7% NOI yield going forward. 
And as Jim identified before, we build our growth profile for all of our transactions from the ground up. And our sales teams within the United States are incredibly excited about this opportunity. We get search rings in from all of our carriers every day, who are identifying areas where, in fact, they need RF coverage.

But just as a reference point, in our guidance, we have about 150 this year. 
So there was a lot of building last year specifically in this market. Hopefully, we can channel some of that to Verizon towers in the future, because they'll now be available on our process and on our contracts. So that's one way. 
The other way is you just don't put the cell site out there or you put it in a sub-optimal location.

In addition, our adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to approximately $724 million and adjusted funds from operations increased 16.9% to approximately $514 million. Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was approximately $183 million and net income per basic and diluted common share was $0.45.

24766,290277838,798565,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a strong start to the year with solid global organic core growth in revenue, good margin performance across our business, the closing of our strategic transaction with Verizon in the U.S. and ju",2501,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a strong start to the year with solid global organic core growth in revenue, good margin performance across our business, the closing of our strategic transaction with Verizon in the U.S. and just yesterday, the closing of the first of TIM sites in Brazil. We believe that our legacy asset base, coupled with the Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria transactions positions us well for not only another excellent year in 2015 but also well into the future. 
If you please turn to Slide 6. Our consolidated rental management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 11% to well over $1 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was nearly 16% and of this core growth, over 9% was organic. The balance of our core growth or more than 6% was attributable to the properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including more than 12,000 in the United States and over 8,000 in our international markets. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management reported in core growth and revenue was about 13% with organic core growth of 9.3%. During the quarter, we recognized about $17 million in revenue associated with the decommissioning agreement with one of our major tenants. As we have said previously, this is an agreement that will generate roughly $20 million of revenue annually through 2016, but the recognition of that revenue will not occur evenly through the year. Excluding revenue recorded under this agreement from both periods, domestic organic core growth would've been approximately 7.4%. 
The Verizon Tower transaction, which we closed at the very end of the quarter, generated around $4 million in rental revenue and $2 million in gross margin in Q1. For 2015, we expect these towers to generate about $300 million in rental revenue and $160 million or so in rental gross margin as well as around $10 million in services revenue and $5 million in services gross margin. 
During the quarter, our application pipeline showed a significant increase from 3 of our 4 top customers. This supports our previous expectations that new business activity will be weighted more in the second half of the year. 
Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by almost 14% on both the reported and core basis to $585 million and reflected an 87% revenue conversion rate. We constructed 23 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on more than 350 ground leases, with extensions averaging about 29 years. 
As of the end of the quarter, including the new Verizon sites, nearly 60% of the land under our U.S. towers was either owned or controlled for more than 20 years. And we are targeting to achieve 80% within the next 5 years. Given that land ownership under our recently added Verizon sites is under 10%, we think that we have an excellent opportunity to deploy capital for land at attractive returns over the next several years. 
And finally, we generated reported and core domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 15%. This reflects our continuing focus on property level cost controls, SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 4%, coupled with strong revenue growth. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter with core growth of approximately 22% and organic core growth of about 10%. Reported revenue, which was impacted by the negative foreign currency translation effects of about $50 million from the year-ago period, was over 6%. 
We continue to see strong demand for sites across our portfolio with markets in Latin America, such as Brazil and Colombia, once again leading the way in terms of total new business commencements, generating organic core growth of 12% and 17%, respectively. In addition, markets such as India and Ghana are seeing strong momentum from a leasing perspective with organic core growth of 11% and 23%, respectively. The majority of our international organic new business commencements continues to come from large investment grade sentence, including Airtel, Vodafone and Telefónica, who are also the 3 largest international signed business customers in the quarter. In addition, we completed the construction of more than 600 build-to-suit properties across our international footprint in Q1. In India, where we built over 400 sites, our program is anchored by build-to-suit for operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. In Brazil, where we completed the construction of over 90 sites, our program is primarily supporting the new build needs of Vivo and TIM, who are also expected the majority of our new business revenue in the market this year and will support our expectations of seeing mid-teen core organic growth in Brazil this year. 
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 12% to about $221 million, while core growth in gross margin was around 28%, outpacing the 22% revenue core growth. 
International rental and management segment operating profit grew 10.5% to $186 million. And our core international operating profit margin, which excludes pass-through, was 73%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 13%. Adjusted EBITDA core growth was 17.5% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was over 67%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 73% and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was 93%. This conversion ratio was impacted favorably by around 100 basis points due to the $17 million in revenue we recorded under the decommissioning agreement I mentioned earlier. For the balance of the year, we would expect our reported conversion ratio to moderate as we have the Verizon sites and the TIM and Airtel portfolios to our asset base due to their lower average tenancies versus our legacy portfolio. 
Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was about 8.7%. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be under 9%. Longer-term, we would expect this percentage to decline further as we drive organic growth across the portfolio. Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased nearly 17% to $514 million or $1.25 per share. AFFO per share growth was about 14%, which includes a onetime negative impact of about $0.03 per share attributable to the timing of our recent equity issuance versus the actual closings of the Verizon transaction. 
Core AFFO growth was over 21%. And our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion rate during the quarter was about 89%. These metrics were also favorably impacted by the resulting impacts of the equipment decommissioning agreement. 
I do want to highlight that on a sequential basis, due to the timing of these decommissioning revenues as well as some seasonality in maintenance CapEx and the timing of our preferred dividend distributions, we expect second quarter growth of organic revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO to be below what we're reporting for Q1. This impact will be more pronounced, given the bulk of our U.S. equipment decommissioning revenues last year that we recorded in the second quarter. As a result of this timing difference, our expectations for the quarter includes domestic organic core growth of just under 7%. Excluding the impact of decommissioning in both periods, we would expect Q2 domestic organic core growth to be consistent with Q1 at around 7.5%. 
Moving on to Slide 10. We are raising our full year outlook for rental and management revenue and adjusted EBITDA due to the addition of the Verizon and TIM Brazil sites, stronger than expected growth attributable to recurring cash revenues associated with our core rental and management business and slightly higher than expected back-billing revenue. This is being partially offset by the negative foreign currency translation effects implied by a revised outlook FX rates, which are calculated by taking the more conservative of the Bloomberg median forecast and the 30-day average spot for each currency. Our revised outlook FX rates are currently 3% to 4% above yesterday's closing spot rates. We now expect 2015 rental and management segment revenue of about $4.6 billion at the midpoint. The increase is driven by about $300 million in additional rental revenue from the Verizon assets, including about $20 million in straight line and $55 million in revenue from the TIM sites. We also now expect an increase in other straight line revenue for the full year of about $10 million and about $10 million of other legacy asset outperformance. This growth is being partially offset by an incremental $75 million of negative foreign currency translation effects relative to our prior outlook and a $10 million decrease in expected pass-through revenue. As a reminder, the impacts of the roughly 2300 TIM sites we have not yet closed on as well as the 4800 Airtel Nigeria sites are excluded from our current outlook. Together, we would expect these portfolios to generate nearly $300 million in additional revenue on a full year pro forma basis. 
For the year, we now expect core growth and consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 22%, which includes organic core growth expectations of over 7% and 10% for our domestic and international segments, respectively. This organic core growth is slightly better than the assumptions included in our prior outlook. And on a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 organic core revenue growth to be about 8%. 
In addition, we are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $150 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the new assets we have added to our portfolio, complemented by organic outperformance in solid cost controls. The midpoint of our outlook reflects SG&A as a percentage of revenue of under 9%. And on a consolidated basis, we now expect core growth and adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 19%. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO outlook to midpoint by $85 million. This is being driven by about $175 million in incremental cash EBITDA from new assets and $10 million in incremental cash EBITDA from legacy sites. This growth is being partially offset by just over $65 million in incremental cash interest and preferred dividend payments, which includes the impact of funding the Verizon and TIM Brazil transactions. 
We also expect our cash taxes to be lower by over $10 million versus our prior outlook assumptions. 
Finally, the negative foreign currency translation effects leads to an incremental $45 million negative impact versus our prior AFFO outlook. We now expect to generate AFFO growth of about 13% for the year or over 21% on a core basis. 
As you can see on the chart on the right side of the page, we no expect to have about 423 million weighted average diluted shares for the year, given our recent common stock issuance, which implies AFFO per share of about $4.86 at the midpoint of our outlook compared with about $4.91 at the midpoint of our prior outlook. This includes an approximately $0.11 per share due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation as well as a onetime cost of $0.03 due to the timing of our equity issuance and transaction closings, partially offset by some outperformance in our core business. However, we expect our pending Airtel transaction to provide an incremental $0.05 or so of AFFO per share accretion relative to our 2015 outlook, with an anticipated end of May closing date. So as a result, we expect to fully offset the incremental negative impact of foreign currency translation and equity pre-funding cost and AFFO per share for the year and maintain the $4.91 AFFO per share expectation. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've invested nearly $6 billion to our M&A program, declared over $200 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx. 
We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO flow per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders to our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in our REIT distribution of over 20%. And in fact, over the last 12 months, growth in our common dividend per share has been close to 30%. Please note that the amounts and timing of our future REIT distributions will be discretion of our board. 
We seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity. And as of the end of the quarter pro forma for the first tranche of the TIM deal and the retirement of our 7% notes, had over $1 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to further extend duration and our maturities, which today, have an average remaining term of about 5 years with an average cost of less than 4%. By funding our M&A in 2015 with a combination of proceeds from common and mandatory convertible preferred stock issuances, debt and cash on hand, we expect in 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range. Longer-term, our target leverage range continues to be between 3x and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. We started 2015 with a strong operational quarter. Strategically expanded our U.S. footprint to about 40,000 towers and added nearly 4200 sites in Brazil by closing the first tranche of the TIM transaction just yesterday. Our top priority remains driving continued operational performance, while focusing on the integration of these portfolios as effectively and efficiently as possible. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and are raising our 2015 outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we now expect core growth in all 3 of these metrics to be well above our long-term targets. By year-end, we expect to have nearly 100,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and manageable leverage in the mid-5x range. Due to our disciplined consistent global capital allocation program, we continue to generate organic core revenue growth that compares favorably to that of our peers with a global portfolio more than double the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our asset base now with an average current tenancy of just under 2 tenants per tower and significant exposure to high-growth markets, positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments but also sustain strong growth over the long-term. As a result, we expect to continue to deliver consistent, recurring growth in AFFO per share and a compelling total return to stockholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Last quarter, I reviewed American Tower's long-standing strategy and provided performance data on the company's successful execution of that strategy.

Last quarter, I reviewed American Tower's long-standing strategy and provided performance data on the company's successful execution of that strategy. Today, I'll focus on the leasing environment in the U.S. tower market, which is by far, our largest segment in terms of financial results. 
Our overall conclusion is that ongoing escalating demand for mobile bandwidth, especially video, will support robust leasing growth in the U.S. for many years to come will especially benefit our newly acquired Verizon towers, given their low existing tenancy, franchise locations and distinctive structural and ground space attributes. 
Today, the U.S. telecom industry is in the midst of a multi-decade investment cycle, supporting the transition of communications in our country and media delivery as well from wired and cordless to truly mobile technologies. The cycle's first decade occurred roughly between 2000 and 2010 and was mainly characterized by delivering basic mobile voice, text and Internet services to the mass market using simple feature phones. In this period, U.S. wireless penetration rose from 38% to 99% and carriers invested approximately $220 billion in wireless CapEx or about $20 billion a year as voice and data coverage was completed across the nation. 
To better support our customers during this time frame, we significantly expanded our domestic tower portfolio. In 2005, we achieved industry-leading scale by adding more than 7800 tower sites to our merger with SpectraSite. 
Then with the initial iPhone launch in 2007, existing network infrastructure in the U.S. was rapidly overwhelmed and the market began to transition to the decade of data. As consumers have shifted more of their daily activities to a mobile environment, data usage has exploded. From 2010 through the end of 2014, mobile data usage in the U.S. grew more than eightfold. The smartphone penetration tripled during those 4 years from just 25% or so in 2010 to more than 75%. Consumers can now buy a cup of coffee or plane tickets, [indiscernible] lift, pay a bill or transfer funds to or from their bank accounts all on their smartphone. With more than 400 million connected devices in the U.S. today generating ever higher usage, wireless carriers have invested more than $135 billion in wireless CapEx since 2010 or around $30 billion a year and are expected to invest another $30 billion and more in 2015. 
Moreover, while incremental spectrum and technology improvements have helped to alleviate a portion of the strain on carrier networks, most of the solution lies in adding physical equipment, such as base station electronics and tenants and connecting cables, largely deployed on macro towers. 
[indiscernible] even technology improvements such as voice over LTE, eventually lead to additional physical equipment requirements, as we described in our prior call. 
Another example is the concept known as carrier aggregation, in which multiple bands of spectrum with different propagation characteristics are together and the result is improved network speeds. However, as 4G penetration continues to grow and mobile data usage inevitably escalates, if mobile operators continue to utilize carrier aggregation, they will be increasingly compelled to design their network architecture around the highest frequency band being used. Given the signals using higher frequency spectrum travel shorter distances, a denser transmission site footprint to cover given territory will be needed. Hence, the ultimate outcome of carrier aggregation in our view includes more deployed physical equipment on more tower sites to maintain signal strength and coverage consistently. 
Looking ahead over the next 5 years, mobile data usage is expected to grow at nearly 50% annually, with much of this growth driven by the expansion of mobile video. For example, the NFL is set to kick off and over-the-top mobile operating upcoming football season. 
In addition, Apple, HBO and Sony have all announced their intention to participate in direct mobile delivery of premium branded content to handsets. And Google, just last week announced the launch of its own wireless services to promote greater mobile Internet use, including 4G videos. 
So to facilitate these video and other applications, industry projections suggest that 4G penetration should rise from this current level of 40% in the U.S. to well over 60% or more by 2020. 
While we expect wireless trends over the next 5 years to drive significant incremental network investment and leasing business on our real estate, we also believe the outlook for the following decade has the potential to be just as dynamic. We expect much of the network investment in the 2020s in the U.S. to be driven by further expansion in high-bandwidth mobile video content. According to Cisco, video will account for over 70% of U.S. mobile data traffic by 2019 and we expect that percentage to increase even further thereafter. As carriers add density to their 4G networks and as 5G becomes a reality in 2020 and beyond, we anticipate the consumers will come to expect that their favorite HD quality video sources should all be available on all of their viewing devices, including mobile. 
Premium subscriber-based content and live sporting events streamed directly to handsets and tablets will create unprecedented strain on wireless networks. And we expect that the majority of this solution for that problem will continue to be to add incremental equipment largely on macro tops. 
Given that 84% of the U.S. population lives outside of core cities and that the average American spends nearly an hour a day commuting in a car, bus or train, the need for tower-based communications infrastructure is only going to increase overtime. 
After acquiring GTP in late 2013 and adding the Verizon assets to our portfolio at the end of the first quarter, we believe that American Tower is extremely well-positioned to achieve sustainable long-term growth in the U.S. by providing the mission-critical real estate as these mobile industry trends play out over time. 
Our recent transaction with Verizon brought us a very large portfolio of properties in attractive locations that provides significant available height, structural capacity and ground space. These sites come to us with the lowest initial tenancy of any major U.S. tower deal that we're aware of. This combination bodes well for solid leasing growth over a long period of time. 
Moreover, 2/3 of these sites have no competing structure within a half mile,  highlighting the franchise value of these locations. 
Our U.S. tower operation is off to a fast start on the integration of the Verizon portfolio. All of the 11,448 properties are already in our cloud-based site locator app and we are already aggressively marketing these assets to our tenant base. 
In closing, we believe that we are squarely in the middle of an extensive, long-term cycle of technological innovation in the U.S. telecom industry. We have seen the transition from land lines to basic cell phones to 3G smartphones now to 4G connected devices. 
We're updating mobile applications that were unavailable just 5 years ago. And our expectations is that the breakneck speed of mobile technology innovation and development, especially regarding the entertainment industry, will continue well into the future. Consequently, we believe that when it comes the ongoing growth of our U.S. leasing business, we have plenty of runway remaining in front of us. 
Steve, could you now please open the line for questions? Thanks."

I mean, what we've seen coming out of the gate is our strong volumes in our international markets, Brazil, Colombia, some of those markets are continually seeing strong demand. As I mentioned on the last call, back billing is something that we track kind of throughout the year because we don't really have a sense out of the gate how that's going to pan out for the year. So we would expect some increase in our back billing revenue for the year. And in the U.S., it's right where we said -- thought it was going to be. However, were seeing application volumes significantly higher than where they were at the end of the third and fourth quarter of last year. So we're expecting good solid growth from that. As I mentioned before, as we originally expected largely in the second half of the year. So all told, we're seeing growth really up in all of our markets. On the expense side, we continue to hone in on our cost controls and expenses. And so that's also in our EBITDA outperformance. That's driving about $10 million of that outperformance. So I think it's a really strong start to the year. And as I mentioned, coupling it with the Verizon sites and the sites we just closed yesterday with TIM and expect to close with Airtel next month, and then following on with the other TIM sites, we're able to raise our overall guidance."

So for this particular year, from a growth perspective, we are integrating them now. As Jim said, we've put them all now out on air.

And so the pipelines are already started up. Where these applications going to come from? Maybe I'll step through the U.S. operators. And importantly, our industry verticals, as Tom just suggested, the sources for new business here. The Verizon, first of all,, is the most active mobile operator we have in our U.S. marketplace today as far as tower leasing. And of course, it's their towers and they have right there. So let's put that into perspective for a second. Of the 40,000 towers we have in the U.S., about 11,500 of them are these Verizon transacted towers, leaving 28,500 other towers that they have plenty of opportunity to go on. So that is the portfolio we're just talked about, but I just want to put in perspective. The 3/4 [ph] of our U.S. tower portfolio is wide open to additional applications for both amendments and collocations by Verizon. So stepping down to the second most active carrier that we see in the first -- in our first quarter was T-Mobile. Our T-Mobile is doing a terrific job of adding some net subscribers and therefore, leading to build up their network to serve those subscribers. They're deploying their 700 megahertz spectrum. And they're also upgrading the MetroPCS sites to the sort of overall standards so that they deliver great service to these new customers that they're bringing on board. And then third is still AT&T. And AT&T for us, first of all, has a really nice space of growth, which is our holistic agreement. And so with AT&T, while every carrier will have variations in its standard deployment pattern over -- quarter-to-quarter, over a period of years, we have smooth out much of that pattern in the case of AT&T with our holistic agreement. So we've got nice growth from them all through this year, even though their spend rates may be in variable position versus last year. And we're seeing good business from them. Now the holistic agreement does not apply to the Verizon sites. And so AT&T ramps up back into more normalized deployment rate, spend rate, we're going to be extremely well-positioned with those Verizon sites to capture that on a retail business, if you will. And next, Sprint, again, not as active as the other 3. But again, also pent-up demand we think to work on their network as the next few quarters play out, although we're not seeing the applications quite yet, we expect to see some more from Sprint as we go forward. And then lastly, I mentioned the industry verticals. These are the world carriers, the ISPs, government agencies, industries that we serve, such as the oil and gas industry and others, that will welcome a smooth and easy application process to get on these Verizon sites. So we have 11 months to run our first full year and those are the sources that I feel will add to the demand for the Verizon towers."

We as you know, very disciplined investment process within the business. We will return cash back to shareholders in addition to the dividend that we pay. And we had done that about 2 years ago. The assets that we've acquired over the last 2 years were very compelling and we would expect significant returns coming from those. And so until we get our balance sheet back to where we think is stable, which is that south of 5x, we're going to continue to repay that debt and again, provide that footing for us going forward. It's not to us from looking at opportunities going forward. We will do so and do so on a kind of neutral leverage type of a way. But if any of those opportunities don't exist when we get to those kinds of level, yes, we would then look to open back up the buyback program that the board has authorized us to do."

And just sort of a follow-up question to the commentary, as you know, if you're starting to think that carrier aggregation from a carrier perspective is in order to support ongoing bandwidth demand and that requires why is small cells not enough to provide that, even from just sort of a network planning or technology perspective? Is it cost prohibitive versus the macro cell investment? Just trying to understand sort of the dynamics there as to why that type of migration from a technology perspective should continue to support the macro cell investment."
24766,290277838,798565,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","It's Jim. It's technology and economically prohibitive to serve the U.S. population widely with small cells for this purpose. And the technical reasons are that most of the U.S. population lives in places with dense -- population density of less than 5000",507,"It's Jim. It's technology and economically prohibitive to serve the U.S. population widely with small cells for this purpose. And the technical reasons are that most of the U.S. population lives in places with dense -- population density of less than 5000 people per square mile. And you need about 10,000 people per square mile, in our view, to make a small cell deployment even in conjunction with an overarching microcell deployment on top of that, economically and technically feasible, right? So just to go down a couple of the factors. On the technology piece, the hand off requirement from places where our towers serve people, which are often around highways and other transportation corridors, suburban or rural, you got people traveling 30 to 60 miles an hour. You can't really have sufficient hand off capability over a very large stretch of multi-mile roadway to economically provide those handoffs. Secondly, your signal needs to cover more ground. It has to be  elevated. And therefore, it kind of obviates the architecture of small cells when you get into the suburban and rural environment. And again, to put that all in context, the notion of where our towers are and where small cells make sense is really important. So in areas of 10,000 people per square mile or above, we've only got about half a percent of our tower base in those areas. If you go to 5000 people or above, we've only got about 5% total of our towers in those places. So our towers serve people in suburbs, rural areas and transportation corridors where again technically and economically, the small cells don't make sense. I give you a couple of points of economics. You got to have a fiber connection to every small cell. So if you're going to try to cover the roadway from Hopkinton, Massachusetts where the marathon starts all the way to Boylston Street, you need hundreds and hundreds of small cells to do that. You need 26 miles of fiber just to do 1 road. And that's one of many, many roads that go from west to east in our area. It's just an economically feasible opportunity. And you also need, by the way, site cost. Wherever you put your small cell, you really have to pay somebody, whether it's the town, the utility, have a revenue share. The economics just, again, don't make sense once you got outside in our view of about 10,000 people per square mile. So in dense urban, absolutely small cells are going to happen. The growth rates are going to be high because small cells very, very small proportion of the gigabit per month delivery of the network today. And so it's going to grow faster. And we've shown and said that in some of our previous technology briefings. But the bulk of the spending and the bulk of the traffic is still, in our view, 4 years to come, going to be carried by the macro site because that's where most of the people are."

And I would expect that they would want to have the same type of customer experience in Mexico that they have in the United States. So we're very hopeful that we'll be seeing some of that build and some of that activity probably in the latter half of the year. With regards to what América Móvil is doing, in terms of the split out of their sites, I think time will tell in terms of the impact in the marketplace, in terms of are they going to be aggressively marketing those sites or not, will they ultimately be putting those sites up for sale or not. It's very difficult to tell at this point in time. But we think that overall, Simon, it's going to open the entire market and it will compel the competition in the market to more aggressively spend the market. As I said over the last year or so, given all the activity that's going on in the market relative to América Móvil and now AT&T, the market for us has been relatively sleepy. From a core organic growth rate, it's been below 10% for us, whereas the prior couple of years, before that, the organic growth rate was quite extensive. So I think that there has been some underspend  in that market over the last 24 months. And I think once the -- some of these issues get put to bed, I'm hopeful that we'll start to see some solid organic growth rate over the next 8 to 24 months."

That's kind of our core technical assumption in the U.S. and that drives our long-term projection for the U.S. here. In Mexico, the entry of AT&T, we believe, is going to accelerate that pattern in Mexico. So this is essentially very limited or no 4G service in the Mexico market today. Our expectation is that AT&T will that technology addition into the market. And now you'll have 100 million people in Mexico that will be on a track, whether it's by the end of this decade or by the middle of the next decade, to have most of its population on 4G at 3 to 5 gigabits per month of service. So we see this is a real catalyst for Mexico for the next 5 to 10-year period that AT&T is going to bring its level of quality, its level of consumer delivery of gigabits a month or close to that level at least from U.S. to Mexico."

After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions.
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2015 outlook and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our pending acquisition, future growth, industry trends and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.

We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Please note that we have adjusted the definitions of core growth, organic core growth and new property core growth to exclude the impact of pass-through. You will see this change reflected during today's call and in our earnings materials going forward.
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which provides a summary of our first quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 10.6% from the first quarter of 2014 to over $1.06 billion. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to approximately $724 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased 16.9% to approximately $514 million. Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was approximately $183 million, and net income per basic and diluted common share was $0.45.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."
24766,290277838,799048,"American Tower Corporation (REIT), Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","American Tower Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a strong start to the year with solid global organic core growth in revenue, good margin performance across our business, the closing of our strategic transaction with Verizon in the U.S. and, j",2516,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a strong start to the year with solid global organic core growth in revenue, good margin performance across our business, the closing of our strategic transaction with Verizon in the U.S. and, just yesterday, the closing of the first tranche of TIM sites in Brazil. We believe that our legacy asset base, coupled with the Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria transactions positions us well for not only another excellent year in 2015 but also well into the future.
If you please turn to Slide 6. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 11% to well over $1 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was nearly 16%, and of this core growth, over 9% was organic. The balance of our core growth or more than 6% was attributable to properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including more than 12,000 in the United States and over 8,000 in our international markets.
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management, reported in core growth and revenue, was about 13% with organic core growth of 9.3%. During the quarter, we recognized about $17 million in revenue associated with the decommissioning agreement with one of our major tenants. As we have said previously, this is an agreement that will generate roughly $20 million of revenue annually through 2016, but the recognition of that revenue will not occur evenly through the year. Excluding revenue recorded under this agreement from both periods, domestic organic core growth would have been approximately 7.4%.
The Verizon tower transaction, which we closed at the very end of the quarter, generated around $4 million in rental revenue and $2 million in gross margin in Q1. For 2015, we expect these towers to generate about $300 million in rental revenue and $160 million or so in rental gross margin as well as around $10 million in services revenue and $5 million in services gross margin. During the quarter, our application pipeline showed a significant increase from 3 of our 4 top customers. This supports our previous expectations that new business activity will be weighted more in the second half of the year.
Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by almost 14% on both a reported and core basis to $585 million and reflected an 87% revenue conversion rate. We constructed 23 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on more than 350 ground leases, with extensions averaging about 29 years.
As of the end of the quarter, including the new Verizon sites, nearly 60% of the land under our U.S. towers was either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we are targeting to achieve 80% within the next 5 years. Given that land ownership under our recently added Verizon sites is under 10%, we think that we have an excellent opportunity to deploy capital for land at attractive returns over the next several years.
And finally, we generated reported and core domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 15%. This reflects our continuing focus on property level cost controls, SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 4%, coupled with strong revenue growth.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter, with core growth of approximately 22% and organic core growth of about 10%. Reported revenue, which was impacted by the negative foreign currency translation effects of about $50 million from the year-ago period, was over 6%. 
We continue to see strong demand for sites across our portfolio, with markets in Latin America, such as Brazil and Colombia, once again leading the way in terms of total new business commencements, generating organic core growth of 12% and 17%, respectively. In addition, markets such as India and Ghana are seeing strong momentum from a leasing perspective with organic core growth of 11% and 23%, respectively. The majority of our international organic new business commencements continues to come from large investment-grade tenants, including Airtel, Vodafone and Telefónica, who are also the 3 largest international signed new business customers in the quarter.
In addition, we completed the construction of more than 600 build-to-suit properties across our international footprint in Q1. In India, where we built over 400 sites, our program is anchored by build-to-suits for operators, such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. In Brazil, where we completed the construction of over 90 sites, our program is primarily supporting the new build needs of Vivo and TIM, who are also expected to drive the majority of our new business revenue in the market this year and will support our expectations of seeing mid-teen core organic growth in Brazil this year.
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 12% to about $221 million, while core growth in gross margin was around 28%, outpacing the 22% revenue core growth.
International rental and management segment operating profit grew 10.5% to $186 million. And our core international operating profit margin, which excludes pass-through, was 73%.
Turning to Slide 9. Reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 13%. Adjusted EBITDA core growth was 17.5%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was over 67%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 73% and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was 93%. This conversion ratio was impacted favorably by around 100 basis points due to the $17 million in revenue we recorded under the decommissioning agreement I mentioned earlier. For the balance of the year, we would expect our reported conversion ratio to moderate as we add the Verizon sites and the TIM and Airtel portfolios to our asset base due to their lower average tenancies versus our legacy portfolio.
Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was about 8.7%. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be under 9%. Longer term, we would expect this percentage to decline further as we drive organic growth across the portfolio.
Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased nearly 17% to $514 million or $1.25 per share. AFFO per share growth was about 14%, which includes a onetime negative impact of about $0.03 per share attributable to the timing of our recent equity issuance versus the actual closings of the Verizon transaction. Core AFFO growth was over 21%, and our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion rate during the quarter was about 89%. These metrics were also favorably impacted by the resulting impacts of the equipment decommissioning agreement.
I do want to highlight that on a sequential basis, due to the timing of these decommissioning revenues as well as some seasonality in maintenance CapEx and the timing of our preferred dividend distributions, we expect second quarter growth in organic revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO to be below what we're reporting for Q1. This impact will be more pronounced given the bulk of our U.S. equipment decommissioning revenues last year and were recorded in the second quarter. As a result of this timing difference, our expectations for the quarter includes domestic organic core growth of just under 7%. Excluding the impacts of decommissioning in both periods, we would expect Q2 domestic organic core growth to be consistent with Q1 at around 7.5%.
Moving on to Slide 10. We are raising our full year outlook for rental and management revenue and adjusted EBITDA due to the addition of the Verizon and TIM Brazil sites, stronger than expected growth attributable to recurring cash revenues associated with our core rental and management business and slightly higher than expected back-billing revenue. This is being partially offset by the negative foreign currency translation effects implied by our revised outlook FX rates, which are calculated by taking the more conservative of the Bloomberg median forecast and the 30-day average spot for each currency. Our revised outlook FX rates are currently 3% to 4% above yesterday's closing spot rates.
We now expect 2015 rental and management segment revenue of about $4.6 billion at the midpoint. The increase is driven by about $300 million in additional rental revenue from the Verizon assets, including about $20 million in straight line and $55 million in revenue from the TIM sites. We also now expect an increase in other straight line revenue for the full year of about $10 million and about $10 million of other legacy asset outperformance. This growth is being partially offset by an incremental $75 million of negative foreign currency translation effects relative to our prior outlook and a $10 million decrease in expected pass-through revenue. As a reminder, the impacts of the roughly 2,300 TIM sites we have not yet closed on as well as the 4,800 Airtel Nigeria sites are excluded from our current outlook. Together, we would expect these portfolios to generate nearly $300 million in additional revenue on a full year pro forma basis.
For the year, we now expect core growth and consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 22%, which includes organic core growth expectations of over 7% and 10% for our domestic and international segments, respectively. This organic core growth is slightly better than the assumptions included in our prior outlook. And on a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 organic core revenue growth to be about 8%.
In addition, we are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $150 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the new assets we have added to our portfolio, complemented by organic outperformance in solid cost controls. The midpoint of our outlook reflects SG&A as a percentage of revenue of under 9%. And on a consolidated basis, we now expect core growth and adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 19%.
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO outlook to midpoint by $85 million. This is being driven by about $175 million in incremental cash EBITDA from new assets and $10 million in incremental cash EBITDA from legacy sites. This growth is being partially offset by just over $65 million in incremental cash interest and preferred dividend payments, which includes the impact of funding the Verizon and TIM Brazil transactions. We also expect our cash taxes to be lower by over $10 million versus our prior outlook assumptions. Finally, the negative foreign currency translation effect leads to an incremental $45 million negative impact versus our prior AFFO outlook. We now expect to generate AFFO growth of about 13% for the year or over 21% on a core basis.
As you can see in the chart on the right side of the page, we now expect to have about $423 million -- 423 million weighted average diluted shares for the year given our recent common stock issuance, which implies AFFO per share of about $4.86 at the midpoint of our outlook compared with about $4.91 at the midpoint of our prior outlook. This includes an approximately $0.11 per share due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation as well as a onetime cost of $0.03 due to the timing of our equity issuance and transaction closings, partially offset by some outperformance in our core business. However, we expect our pending Airtel transaction to provide an incremental $0.05 or so of AFFO per share accretion relative to our 2015 outlook, with an anticipated end of May closing date. So as a result, we expect to fully offset the incremental negative impact of foreign currency translation and equity pre-funding cost and AFFO per share for the year and maintain the $4.91 AFFO per share expectation.
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've invested nearly $6 billion to our M&A program, declared over $200 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx.
We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders to our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in our REIT distribution of over 20%. And in fact, over the last 12 months, growth in our common dividend per share has been close to 30%. Please note that the amounts and timing of our future REIT distributions will be at discretion of our board.
We seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity. And as of the end of the quarter, pro forma for the first tranche of the TIM deal and the retirement of our 7% notes had over $1 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to further extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which, today, have an average remaining term of about 5 years with an average cost of less than 4%. By funding our M&A in 2015 with a combination of proceeds from common and mandatory convertible preferred stock issuances, debt and cash on hand, we expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range. Longer term, our target leverage range continues to be between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. We started 2015 with a strong operational quarter, strategically expanded our U.S. footprint to about 40,000 towers and added nearly 4,200 sites in Brazil by closing the first tranche of the TIM transaction just yesterday. Our top priority remains driving continued operational performance while focusing on the integration of these portfolios as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As a result, we believe we are well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and are raising our 2015 outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we now expect core growth in all 3 of these metrics to be well above our long-term targets. By year-end, we expect to have nearly 100,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and manageable leverage in the mid-5x range.
Due to our disciplined, consistent global capital allocation program, we continue to generate organic core revenue growth that compares favorably to that of our peers with a global portfolio more than double the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our asset base now, with an average current tenancy of just under 2 tenants per tower and significant exposure to high-growth markets, positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments but also sustain strong growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to deliver consistent, recurring growth in AFFO per share and a compelling total return to stockholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Last quarter, I reviewed American Tower's long-standing strategy and provided performance data on the company's successful execution of that strategy. Today, I'll focus on the leasing environment in the U.S. tower",1215,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I reviewed American Tower's long-standing strategy and provided performance data on the company's successful execution of that strategy. Today, I'll focus on the leasing environment in the U.S. tower market, which is, by far, our largest segment in terms of financial results.
Our overall conclusion is that ongoing, escalating demand for mobile bandwidth, especially video, will support robust leasing growth in the U.S. for many years to come. This will especially benefit our newly acquired Verizon towers, given their low existing tenancy, franchise locations and distinctive structural and ground space attributes.
Today, the U.S. telecom industry is in the midst of a multi-decade investment cycle, supporting the transition of communications in our country and media delivery as well from wired and cordless to truly mobile technologies. The cycle's first decade occurred roughly between 2000 and 2010 and was mainly characterized by delivering basic mobile voice, text and Internet services to the mass market using simple feature phones. In this period, U.S. wireless penetration rose from 38% to 99%, and carriers invested approximately $220 billion in wireless CapEx or about $20 billion a year as voice and data coverage was completed across the nation.
To better support our customers during this time frame, we significantly expanded our domestic tower portfolio. In 2005, we achieved industry-leading scale by adding more than 7,800 tower sites through our merger with SpectraSite. Then with the initial iPhone launch in 2007, existing network infrastructure in the U.S. was rapidly overwhelmed and the market began to transition to the decade of data. As consumers have shifted more and more of their daily activities to a mobile environment, data usage has exploded. From 2010 through the end of 2014, mobile data usage in the U.S. grew more than eightfold. The smartphone penetration tripled during those 4 years from just 25% or so in 2010 to more than 75%. Consumers can now buy a cup of coffee or plane tickets, hail an Uber or a Lyft, pay a bill or transfer funds to or from their bank accounts all on their smartphone. With more than 400 million connected devices in the U.S. today generating ever higher usage, wireless carriers have invested more than $135 billion in wireless CapEx since 2010 or around $30 billion a year and are expected to invest another $30 billion or more in 2015.
Moreover, while incremental spectrum and technology improvements have helped to alleviate a portion of the strain on carriers' networks, most of the solution lies in adding physical equipment, such as base station electronics, antennas and connecting cables, largely deployed on macro towers. Often, even technology improvements, such as voice over LTE, eventually lead to additional physical equipment requirements, as we described in our prior call.
Another example is the concept known as carrier aggregation in which multiple bands of spectrum with different propagation characteristics are paired together, and the result is improved network speeds. However, as 4G penetration continues to grow and mobile data usage inevitably escalates, if mobile operators continue to utilize carrier aggregation, they will be increasingly compelled to design their network architecture around the highest frequency band being used. Given the signals using higher frequency spectrum travel shorter distances, a denser transmission site footprint to cover given territory will be needed. Hence, the ultimate outcome of carrier aggregation in our view includes more deployed physical equipment on more tower sites to maintain signal strength and coverage consistently.
Looking ahead, over the next 5 years, mobile data usage is expected to grow at nearly 50% annually, with much of this growth driven by the expansion of mobile video. For example, the NFL is set to kick off an over-the-top mobile offering this upcoming football season. In addition, Apple, HBO and Sony have all announced their intention to participate in direct mobile delivery of premium, branded content to handsets. And Google, just last week, announced the launch of its own wireless services to promote greater mobile Internet use, including for its YouTube videos. So to facilitate these video and other applications, industry projections suggest that 4G penetration should rise from its current level of 40% in the U.S. to well over 60% or more by 2020.
While we expect wireless trends over the next 5 years to drive significant incremental network investment and leasing business on our real estate, we also believe the outlook for the following decade has the potential to be just as dynamic. We expect much of the network investment in the 2020s in the U.S. to be driven by further expansion in high-bandwidth mobile video content. According to Cisco, video will account for over 70% of U.S. mobile data traffic by 2019, and we expect that percentage to increase even further thereafter. As carriers add density to their 4G networks and as 5G becomes a reality in 2020 and beyond, we anticipate that consumers will come to expect that their favorite HD-quality video sources should all be available on all of their viewing devices, including mobile. Premium subscriber-based content and live sporting events streamed directly to handsets and tablets will create unprecedented strain on wireless networks, and we expect that the majority of the solution for that problem will continue to be to add incremental equipment largely on macro towers.
Given that 84% of the U.S. population lives outside of core cities and that the average American spends nearly 1 hour a day commuting in a car, bus or train, the need for tower-based communications infrastructure is only going to increase over time. After acquiring GTP in late 2013 and adding the Verizon assets to our portfolio at the end of the first quarter, we believe that American Tower is extremely well positioned to achieve sustainable long-term growth in the U.S. by providing the mission-critical real estate as these mobile industry trends play out over time.
Our recent transaction with Verizon brought us a very large portfolio of properties in attractive locations that provides significant available height, structural capacity and ground space. These sites come to us with the lowest initial tenancy of any major U.S. tower deal that we're aware of. This combination bodes well for solid leasing growth over a long period of time. Moreover, 2/3 of these sites have no competing structure within 1/2 mile,  highlighting the franchise value of these locations. Our U.S. tower operation is off to a fast start on the integration of the Verizon portfolio. All of the 11,448 properties are already in our cloud-based site locator app, and we're already aggressively marketing these assets to our tenant base.
In closing, we believe that we are squarely in the middle of an extensive, long-term cycle of technological innovation in the U.S. telecom industry. We've seen the transition from landlines to basic cell phones to 3G smartphones now to 4G connected devices. We're all today using mobile applications that were unavailable just 5 years ago, and our expectation is that the breakneck speed of mobile technology innovation and development, especially regarding the entertainment industry, will continue well into the future. Consequently, we believe that when it comes to the ongoing growth of our U.S. leasing business, we have plenty of runway remaining in front of us.

Some of those markets are continually seeing strong demand. As I mentioned on the last call, back-billing is something that we track kind of throughout the year because we don't really have a sense out of the gate how that's going to pan out for the year. So we would expect some increase in our back-billing revenue for the year. And in the U.S., it's right where we said -- thought it was going to be. However, we're seeing application volumes significantly higher than where they were at the end of third and fourth quarter of last year. So we're expecting good solid growth from that, as I mentioned before, as we originally expected, largely in the second half of the year. So all told, we're seeing growth really up in all of our markets. On the expense side, we continue to hone in on our cost controls and expenses, and so that's also in our EBITDA outperformance. That's driving about $10 million of that outperformance. So I think it's a really strong start to the year. And as I mentioned, coupling it with the Verizon sites and the sites we just closed yesterday with TIM and expect to close with Airtel and -- next month and then following on with the other tranche of the TIM sites, we're able to raise our overall guidance."

Of the 40,000 towers we have in the U.S., about 11,500 of them are these Verizon-transacted towers, leaving 28,500 other towers that they have plenty of opportunity to go on. So that is the portfolio we're talking about, but I just want to put in perspective. The 3/4 of our U.S. tower portfolio is wide open to additional applications for both amendments and collocations by Verizon. So stepping down to the second most active carrier that we see in the first -- in our first quarter was T-Mobile. T-Mobile is doing a terrific job of adding some net subscribers and, therefore, needing to build up their network to serve those subscribers. They're deploying their 700 megahertz spectrum, and they're also upgrading the MetroPCS sites to the sort of overall standards so that they can deliver great service to these new customers that they're bringing onboard. And then third is still AT&T. And AT&T, for us, first of all, has a really nice space of growth, which is our holistic agreement. And so with AT&T, while every carrier will have variations in its spend and deployment pattern over -- quarter-to-quarter, over a period of years, we have smoothed out much of that pattern in the case of AT&T with our holistic agreement. So we've got nice growth from them all through this year even though their spend rates may be in variable position versus last year. And we're seeing good business from them. Now the holistic agreement does not apply to the Verizon sites. And so as AT&T ramps up back into a more normalized deployment rate, spend rate, we're going to be extremely well positioned with those Verizon sites to capture that on a retail basis, if you will. And then Sprint, again, not as active as the other 3, but again, also pent-up demand, we think, to work on their network as the next few quarters play out. Although we're not seeing the applications quite yet, we expect to see some more from Sprint as we go forward. And then lastly, I mentioned the industry verticals. These are the world carriers, the ISPs, government agencies, industries that we serve, such as the oil and gas industry and others, that will welcome a smooth and easy application process to get on these Verizon sites. So again, we've got 11 months to run our first full year, and those are the sources that I feel will add to the demand for the Verizon towers."

We're on that path. And therefore, we're going to continue to invest in the business when the returns make sense. And right now, the returns make sense for us. And our batting orders, so to speak, of how we deploy our cash has been stable all the way through this 20- to 30-year strategic time frame, which is now firstly with the REIT dividend that will be first in the order. But it's always been building towers, acquiring towers or lease rights. And then with the remaining cash, if we can't find investment opportunities, we will buy back stock. So we don't time it based on interest rates or multiples or any other thing. We're running the business for a multi-decade strategy to deliver that mid-teen AFFO per share growth. And we think over the long run, that's going to justify really fair equity price and equity price appreciation over time for our shareholders."

So it's not our notion to -- as Jim said, to hoard cash, I mean, to the extent that those opportunities don't exist and we don't see them. We have, as you know, a very disciplined investment committee process within the business. We will return cash back to shareholders in addition to the dividend that we pay. And we had done that about 2 years ago, but the assets that we've acquired over the last 2 years were very compelling, and we would expect significant returns coming from those. And so until we get our balance sheet back to where we think it's stable, which is that south of 5x, we're going to continue to repay that debt and, again, provide that footing for us going forward. It's not to preclude us from looking at opportunities going forward. We will do so and do so on a kind of a neutral leverage type of a way, but any -- if those opportunities don't exist when we get down to those kinds of levels, yes, we would then look to open back up the buyback program that the board has authorized us to do."

And just sort of a follow-up question to the commentary, as you know, if you're starting to think that carrier aggregation from a carrier perspective is necessary in order to support ongoing bandwidth demand and that requires densification, why is small cells not enough to provide that even from just sort of a network planning or technology perspective? Is it cost prohibitive versus the macro cell investment?

It's technology and economically prohibitive to serve the U.S. population widely with small cells for this purpose. And the technical reasons are, again, that most of the U.S. population lives in places with population densities of less than 5,000 people per square mile. And you need about 10,000 people per square mile, in our view, to make a small cell deployment, even in conjunction with an overarching macro cell deployment on top of it, economically and technically feasible, right. And so just to go down a couple of the factors. On the technology piece, the hand-off requirement from places where our towers serve people, which are often around highways and other transportation corridors, suburban or rural, you've got people traveling 30 to 60 miles an hour. You can't really have sufficient hand-off capability over a very large stretch of multi-mile roadway to economically provide those handoffs. Secondly, your signal needs to cover more ground. It has to be elevated, and therefore, it kind of obviates the architecture of small cells when you get into the suburban and rural environment. And again, to put that all in context, the notion of where our towers are and where small cells make sense is really important. So in areas of 10,000 people per square mile or above, we've only got about 0.5% of our tower base in those areas. If you go to 5,000 people or above, we've only got about 5% total of our towers in those places. So our towers serve people in suburbs, rural areas and transportation corridors, where, again, technically and economically, the small cells don't make sense. I'll give you a couple of points on the economics. You've got to have a fiber connection to every small cell. So if you're going to try to cover the roadway from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, where the marathon starts, all the way to Boylston Street, you need hundreds and hundreds of small cells to do that. You need 26 miles of fiber just to do one road. And that's one of many, many roads that go from west to east in our area. It's just an economically infeasible opportunity. And you also need, by the way, siting cost. Wherever you put your small cell, you really have to pay somebody, whether it's the town, the utility, have a revenue share. The economics just, again, don't make sense once you get outside, in our view, of about 10,000 people per square mile. So in dense urban, absolutely, small cells are going to happen. Their growth rates are going to be high because small cells are a very small proportion of the gigabit per month delivery of the network today. And so it's going to grow faster, and we've shown and said that in some of our previous technology briefings. But the bulk of the spending and the bulk of the traffic is still, in our view, for years to come, going to be carried by the macro site because that's where most of the people are."

I think that AT&T right now, having closed the Iusacell transaction and, I believe, just about ready to move on the other transaction with NII or are in the midst of developing their own plans of what that build-out would be. And I would expect that they would want to have the same type of customer experience in Mexico that they have in the United States. So we're very hopeful that we'll be seeing some of that build and some of that activity probably in the latter half of the year. With regards to what América Móvil is doing, in terms of the split out of their sites, I think time will tell in terms of the impact in the marketplace, in terms of, are they going to be aggressively marketing those sites or not? Will they ultimately be putting that -- those sites up for sale or not? It's very difficult to tell at this point in time, but we think that overall, Simon, it is going to open the entire market, and it will compel the competition in the market to more aggressively spend in the market. As I've said over the last year or so, given all the activity that's going on in the market relative to América Móvil and now AT&T, the market for us has been relatively sleepy. From a core organic growth rate, it's been below 10% for us, whereas the prior couple of years, before that, the core organic growth rate was quite extensive. So I think that there has been some underspend  in that market over the last 24 months. And I think once the -- some of these issues get put to bed, I'm hopeful that we'll start to see some really solid organic growth rate over the next 18 to 24 months."

That's kind of our core technical assumption in the U.S., and that drives our long-term projection for the business here. In Mexico, the entry of AT&T, we believe, is going to accelerate that pattern in Mexico. So this is essentially very limited or no 4G service in the Mexico market today. Our expectation is that AT&T will prompt that technology addition into the market, and now you'll have 100 million people in Mexico that will be on track, whether it's by the end of this decade or by the middle of the next decade, to have most of its population on 4G at 3 to 5 gigabits a month service. And so we see this is a real catalyst for Mexico for the next 5- to 10-year period that AT&T is going to bring its level of quality, its level of consumer delivery of gigabits a month or close to that level at least from U.S. to Mexico."

In addition, our adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to approximately $724 million and adjusted funds from operations increased 16.9% to approximately $514 million. Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was approximately $183 million, and net income per basic and diluted common share was $0.45.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a strong start to the year with solid global organic core growth in revenue, good margin performance across our business, the closing of our strategic transaction with Verizon in the U.S. and, j",2516,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a strong start to the year with solid global organic core growth in revenue, good margin performance across our business, the closing of our strategic transaction with Verizon in the U.S. and, just yesterday, the closing of the first tranche of TIM sites in Brazil. We believe that our legacy asset base, coupled with the Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria transactions positions us well for not only another excellent year in 2015 but also well into the future.
If you'd please turn to Slide 6. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 11% to well over $1 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was nearly 16%, and of this core growth, over 9% was organic. The balance of our core growth, or more than 6%, was attributable to properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including more than 12,000 in the United States and over 8,000 in our international markets.
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management, reported in core growth and revenue, was about 13% with organic core growth of 9.3%. During the quarter, we recognized about $17 million in revenue associated with a decommissioning agreement with one of our major tenants. As we have said previously, this is an agreement that will generate roughly $20 million of revenue annually through 2016, but the recognition of that revenue will not occur evenly through the year. Excluding revenue recorded under this agreement from both periods, domestic organic core growth would have been approximately 7.4%.
The Verizon tower transaction, which we closed at the very end of the quarter, generated around $4 million in rental revenue and $2 million in gross margin in Q1. For 2015, we expect these towers to generate about $300 million in rental revenue and $160 million or so in rental gross margin as well as around $10 million in services revenue and $5 million in services gross margin. During the quarter, our application pipeline showed a significant increase from 3 of our 4 top customers. This supports our previous expectations that new business activity would be weighted more in the second half of the year.
Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by almost 14% on both a reported and core basis to $585 million and reflected an 87% revenue conversion rate. We constructed 23 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on more than 350 ground leases, with extensions averaging about 29 years.
As of the end of the quarter, including the new Verizon sites, nearly 60% of the land under our U.S. towers was either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we are targeting to achieve 80% within the next 5 years. Given that land ownership under our recently added Verizon sites is under 10%, we think that we have an excellent opportunity to deploy capital for land at attractive returns over the next several years.
And finally, we generated reported and core domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 15%. This reflects our continuing focus on property level cost controls, SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 4%, coupled with strong revenue growth.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter with core growth of approximately 22% and organic core growth of about 10%. Reported revenue, which was impacted by the negative foreign currency translation effects of about $50 million from the year-ago period, was over 6%. 
We continue to see strong demand for sites across our portfolio, with markets in Latin America, such as Brazil and Colombia, once again leading the way in terms of total new business commencements, generating organic core growth of 12% and 17%, respectively. In addition, markets such as India and Ghana are seeing strong momentum from a leasing perspective with organic core growth of 11% and 23%, respectively. The majority of our international organic new business commencements continues to come from large investment-grade tenants, including Airtel, Vodafone and Telefónica, who are also the 3 largest international signed new business customers in the quarter.
In addition, we completed the construction of more than 600 build-to-suit properties across our international footprint in Q1. In India, where we built over 400 sites, our program is anchored by build-to-suits for operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. In Brazil, where we completed the construction of over 90 sites, our program is primarily supporting the new build needs of Vivo and TIM, who are also expected to drive the majority of our new business revenue in the market this year and will support our expectations of seeing mid-teen core organic growth in Brazil this year.
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 12% to about $221 million, while core growth in gross margin was around 28%, outpacing the 22% revenue core growth.
International rental and management segment operating profit grew 10.5% to $186 million. And our core international operating profit margin, which excludes pass-through, was 73%.
Turning to Slide 9. Reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 13%. Adjusted EBITDA core growth was 17.5%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was over 67%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 73% and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was 93%. This conversion ratio was impacted favorably by around 100 basis points due to the $17 million in revenue we recorded under the decommissioning agreement I mentioned earlier. For the balance of the year, we would expect our reported conversion ratio to moderate as we add the Verizon sites and the TIM and Airtel portfolios to our asset base, due to their lower average tenancies versus our legacy portfolio.
Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was about 8.7%. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be under 9%. Longer term, we would expect this percentage to decline further as we drive organic growth across the portfolio.
Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased nearly 17% to $514 million or $1.25 per share. AFFO per share growth was about 14%, which includes a onetime negative impact of about $0.03 per share attributable to the timing of our recent equity issuance versus the actual closings of the Verizon transaction. Core AFFO growth was over 21%, and our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion rate during the quarter was about 89%. These metrics were also favorably impacted by the resulting impacts of the equipment decommissioning agreement.
I do want to highlight that on a sequential basis, due to the timing of these decommissioning revenues as well as some seasonality in maintenance CapEx and the timing of our preferred dividend distributions, we expect second quarter growth in organic revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO to be below what we're reporting for Q1. This impact will be more pronounced given the bulk of our U.S. equipment decommissioning revenues last year were recorded in the second quarter. As a result of this timing difference, our expectations for the quarter includes domestic organic core growth of just under 7%. Excluding the impacts of decommissioning in both periods, we would expect Q2 domestic organic core growth to be consistent with Q1 at around 7.5%.
Moving on to Slide 10. We are raising our full year outlook for rental and management revenue and adjusted EBITDA due to the addition of the Verizon and TIM Brazil sites, stronger than expected growth attributable to recurring cash revenues associated with our core rental and management business and slightly higher than expected back-billing revenue. This is being partially offset by the negative foreign currency translation effects implied by our revised outlook FX rates, which are calculated by taking the more conservative of the Bloomberg median forecast and the 30-day average spot for each currency. Our revised outlook FX rates are currently 3% to 4% above yesterday's closing spot rates.
We now expect 2015 rental and management segment revenue of about $4.6 billion at the midpoint. The increase is driven by about $300 million in additional rental revenue from the Verizon assets, including about $20 million in straight line and $55 million in revenue from the TIM sites. We also now expect an increase in other straight line revenue for the full year of about $10 million and about $10 million of other legacy asset outperformance. This growth is being partially offset by an incremental $75 million of negative foreign currency translation effects relative to our prior outlook and a $10 million decrease in expected pass-through revenue. As a reminder, the impacts of the roughly 2,300 TIM sites we have not yet closed on, as well as the 4,800 Airtel Nigeria sites, are excluded from our current outlook. Together, we would expect these portfolios to generate nearly $300 million in additional revenue on a full year pro forma basis.
For the year, we now expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 22%, which includes organic core growth expectations of over 7% and 10% for our domestic and international segments, respectively. This organic core growth is slightly better than the assumptions included in our prior outlook. And on a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 organic core revenue growth to be about 8%.
In addition, we are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $150 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the new assets we have added to our portfolio complemented by organic outperformance in solid cost controls. The midpoint of our outlook reflects SG&A as a percentage of revenue of under 9%. And on a consolidated basis, we now expect core growth and adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 19%.
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO outlook to midpoint by $85 million. This is being driven by about $175 million in incremental cash EBITDA from new assets and $10 million in incremental cash EBITDA from legacy sites. This growth is being partially offset by just over $65 million in incremental cash interest and preferred dividend payments, which includes the impact of funding the Verizon and TIM Brazil transactions. We also expect our cash taxes to be lower by over $10 million versus our prior outlook assumptions. Finally, the negative foreign currency translation effects leads to an incremental $45 million negative impact versus our prior AFFO outlook. We now expect to generate AFFO growth of about 13% for the year or over 21% on a core basis.
As you can see in the chart on the right side of the page, we now expect to have about $423 million -- 423 million weighted average diluted shares for the year given our recent common stock issuance, which implies AFFO per share of about $4.86 at the midpoint of our outlook compared with about $4.91 at the midpoint of our prior outlook. This includes an approximately $0.11 per share due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation as well as a onetime cost of $0.03 due to the timing of our equity issuance and transaction closings, partially offset by some outperformance in our core business. However, we expect our pending Airtel transaction to provide an incremental $0.05 or so of AFFO per share accretion relative to our 2015 outlook, with an anticipated end of May closing date. So as a result, we expect to fully offset the incremental negative impact of foreign currency translation and equity pre-funding costs in AFFO per share for the year and maintain the $4.91 AFFO per share expectation.
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've invested nearly $6 billion through our M&A program, declared over $200 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx.
We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in our REIT distribution of over 20%. And in fact, over the last 12 months, growth in our common dividend per share has been close to 30%. Please note that the amounts and timing of our future REIT distributions will be at discretion of our Board.
We seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and as of the end of the quarter, pro forma for the first tranche of the TIM deal and the retirement of our 7% notes, had over $1 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to further extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of about 5 years with an average cost of less than 4%. By funding our M&A in 2015 with a combination of proceeds from common and mandatory convertible preferred stock issuances, debt and cash on hand, we expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range. Longer term, our target leverage range continues to be between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. We started 2015 with a strong operational quarter, strategically expanded our U.S. footprint to about 40,000 towers and added nearly 4,200 sites in Brazil by closing the first tranche of the TIM transaction just yesterday. Our top priority remains driving continued operational performance while focusing on the integration of these portfolios as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As a result, we believe we are well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics and are raising our 2015 outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year, we now expect core growth in all 3 of these metrics to be well above our long-term targets. By year end, we expect to have nearly 100,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and manageable leverage in the mid-5x range.
Due to our disciplined, consistent global capital allocation program, we continue to generate organic core revenue growth that compares favorably to that of our peers, with a global portfolio more than double the size of our closest U.S. publicly traded peers. Our asset base now, with an average current tenancy of just under 2 tenants per tower and significant exposure to high-growth markets, positions us to not only benefit from significant near-term network investments but also sustain strong growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to deliver consistent, recurring growth in AFFO per share and a compelling total return to stockholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

Last quarter, I reviewed American Tower's long-standing strategy and provided performance data on the company's successful execution of that strategy. Today, I'll focus on the leasing environment in the U.S. tower",1218,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I reviewed American Tower's long-standing strategy and provided performance data on the company's successful execution of that strategy. Today, I'll focus on the leasing environment in the U.S. tower market, which is by far our largest segment in terms of financial results.
Our overall conclusion is that ongoing, escalating demand for mobile bandwidth, especially video, will support robust leasing growth in the U.S. for many years to come. And that this will especially benefit our newly acquired Verizon towers, given their low existing tenancy, franchise locations and distinctive structural and ground space attributes.
Today, the U.S. telecom industry is in the midst of a multi-decade investment cycle supporting the transition of communications in our country, and media delivery as well, from wired and cordless to truly mobile technologies. The cycle's first decade occurred roughly between 2000 and 2010 and was mainly characterized by delivering basic mobile voice, text and internet services to the mass market using simple feature phones. In this period, U.S. wireless penetration rose from 38% to 99% and carriers invested approximately $220 billion in wireless CapEx, or about $20 billion a year, as voice and data coverage was completed across the nation.
To better support our customers during this time frame, we significantly expanded our domestic tower portfolio. In 2005, we achieved industry-leading scale by adding more than 7,800 tower sites through our merger with SpectraSite. Then with the initial iPhone launch in 2007, existing network infrastructure in the U.S. was rapidly overwhelmed and the market began to transition to the decade of data. As consumers have shifted more and more of their daily activities to a mobile environment, data usage has exploded. From 2010 through the end of 2014, mobile data usage in the U.S. grew more than eightfold. And smartphone penetration tripled during those 4 years from just 25% or so in 2010 to more than 75%. Consumers can now buy a cup of coffee or plane tickets, hail an Uber or a Lyft, pay a bill or transfer funds to or from their bank accounts all on their smartphone. With more than 400 million connected devices in the U.S. today generating ever higher usage, wireless carriers have invested more than $135 billion in wireless CapEx since 2010 or around $30 billion a year and are expected to invest another $30 billion or more in 2015.
Moreover, while incremental spectrum and technology improvements have helped to alleviate a portion of the strain on carriers' networks, most of the solution lies in adding physical equipment, such as base station electronics, antennas and connecting cables, largely deployed on macro towers. Often, even technology improvements such as voice over LTE eventually lead to additional physical equipment requirements, as we described in our prior call.
Another example is the concept known as carrier aggregation in which multiple bands of spectrum with different propagation characteristics are paired together and the result is improved network speeds. However, as 4G penetration continues to grow and mobile data usage inevitably escalates, if mobile operators continue to utilize carrier aggregation, they will be increasingly compelled to design their network architecture around the highest frequency band being used. Given the signals using higher frequency spectrum travel shorter distances, a denser transmission site footprint to cover a given territory will be needed. Hence, the ultimate outcome of carrier aggregation, in our view, includes more deployed physical equipment on more tower sites to maintain signal strength and coverage consistently.
Looking ahead over the next 5 years, mobile data usage is expected to grow at nearly 50% annually with much of this growth driven by the expansion of mobile video. For example, the NFL is set to kick off an over-the-top mobile offering this upcoming football season. In addition, Apple, HBO and Sony have all announced their intention to participate in direct mobile delivery of premium branded content to handsets. And Google just last week announced the launch of its own wireless services to promote greater mobile Internet use, including for its YouTube videos. So to facilitate these video and other applications, industry projections suggest that 4G penetration should rise from its current level of 40% in the U.S. to well over 60% or more by 2020.
While we expect wireless trends over the next 5 years to drive significant incremental network investment and leasing business on our real estate, we also believe the outlook for the following decade has the potential to be just as dynamic. We expect much of the network investment in the 2020s in the U.S. to be driven by further expansion in high-bandwidth mobile video content. According to Cisco, video will account for over 70% of U.S. mobile data traffic by 2019, and we expect that percentage to increase even further thereafter. As carriers add density to their 4G networks and as 5G becomes a reality in 2020 and beyond, we anticipate that consumers will come to expect that their favorite HD-quality video sources should all be available on all of their viewing devices, including mobile. Premium subscriber-based content and live sporting events streamed directly to handsets and tablets will create unprecedented strain on wireless networks, and we expect that the majority of the solution for that problem will continue to be to add incremental equipment, largely on macro towers.
Given that 84% of the U.S. population lives outside of core cities and that the average American spends nearly 1 hour a day commuting in a car, bus or train, the need for tower-based communications infrastructure is only going to increase over time. After acquiring GTP in late 2013 and adding the Verizon assets to our portfolio at the end of the first quarter, we believe that American Tower is extremely well positioned to achieve sustainable long-term growth in the U.S. by providing the mission-critical real estate as these mobile industry trends play out over time.
Our recent transaction with Verizon brought us a very large portfolio of properties in attractive locations that provide significant available height, structural capacity and ground space. These sites come to us with the lowest initial tenancy of any major U.S. tower deal that we're aware of. This combination bodes well for solid leasing growth over a long period of time. Moreover, 2/3 of these sites have no competing structure within 1/2 mile,  highlighting the franchise value of these locations. Our U.S. tower operation is off to a fast start on the integration of the Verizon portfolio. All of the 11,448 properties are already in our cloud-based site locator app, and we're already aggressively marketing these assets to our tenant base.
In closing, we believe that we are squarely in the middle of an extensive, long-term cycle of technological innovation in the U.S. telecom industry. We've seen the transition from landlines to basic cell phones, to 3G smartphones, now to 4G connected devices. We're all today using mobile applications that were unavailable just 5 years ago, and our expectation is that the breakneck speed of mobile technology innovation and development, especially regarding the entertainment industry, will continue well into the future. Consequently, we believe that when it comes to the ongoing growth of our U.S. leasing business, we have plenty of runway remaining in front of us.

Some of those markets are continually seeing strong demand. As I mentioned on the last call, back-billing is something that we track kind of throughout the year because we don't really have a sense out of the gate how that's going to pan out for the year. So we would expect some increase in our back-billing revenue for the year. And in the U.S., it's right where we said -- thought it was going to be. However, we're seeing application volumes significantly higher than where they were at the end of third and fourth quarter of last year. So we're expecting good solid growth from that, as I mentioned before, as we originally expected, largely in the second half of the year. So all told, we're seeing growth really up in all of our markets. On the expense side, we continue to hone in on our cost controls and expenses, and so that's also in our EBITDA outperformance. That's driving about $10 million of that outperformance. So I think it's a really strong start to the year. And as I mentioned, coupling it with the Verizon sites and the sites we just closed yesterday with TIM and expect to close with Airtel and -- next month and then following on with the other tranche of the TIM sites, we're able to raise our overall guidance."

And I was wondering if you could kind of go back to those claims and kind of -- if I'm characterizing them correctly, and kind of map out the sources behind where you see that growth coming from maybe, Jim, irrespective of kind of the larger picture issues that you mentioned. And then second, on the international side, if I understand it correctly, I think that the international business has mostly, if not entirely, inflation-based escalators.

I mean, I think as Jim laid out, why do we feel comfortable as to that assumption? It's the fact that there's very little overlap. There's very few competitive sites nearby. And the fact that the tenancy on the existing towers is at 1.4 and the fact that these sites have not been marketed, candidly, to any of the other carriers. Particularly not just the big cellular carriers but all the other local users, local customers that we can potentially tap into in those local markets. So for this particular year, from a growth perspective, we're integrating them now. We're -- as Jim said, we've put them all now out on our on-air app. And we're excited about the types of demand and the backlogs that we're seeing. So we are very, very excited about the growth that we would expect. And I think given the tenancy and given the location and the fact that they haven't marketed, we would expect that in short order, that the core organic growth rates on these assets should exceed that of our existing portfolio."

And so the pipeline's already started up. Where are these applications going to come from? Maybe I'll step through the U.S. operators and importantly, our industry verticals, as Tom has suggested, as sources for new business here. Verizon, first of all, is the most active mobile operator we have in our U.S. marketplace today as far as tower leasing. And of course, it's their towers, and they have some rights there. But let's put that in perspective for a second. Of the 40,000 towers we have in the U.S., about 11,500 of them are these Verizon-transacted towers, leaving 28,500 other towers that they have plenty of opportunity to go on. So that's what's in the portfolio we're talking about, but I just want to put in perspective that 3/4 of our U.S. tower portfolio is wide open to additional applications for both amendments and collocations by Verizon. So stepping down to the second most active carrier that we see in the first -- in our first quarter was T-Mobile. T-Mobile is doing a terrific job of adding some -- net subscribers and therefore needing to build up their network to serve those subscribers. They're deploying their 700-megahertz spectrum and they're also upgrading the MetroPCS sites to the sort of overall standard so that they can deliver great service to these new customers that they're bringing onboard. And then third is still AT&T. And AT&T, for us, first of all, has a really nice base of growth, which is our holistic agreement. And so with AT&T, while every carrier will have variations in its spend and deployment pattern over -- quarter-to-quarter, over a period of years, we have smoothed out much of that pattern in the case of AT&T with our holistic agreement. So we've got nice growth from them all through this year even though their spend rates may be in a variable position versus last year. And we're seeing good business from them. Now the holistic agreement does not apply to the Verizon sites. And so as AT&T ramps up back into a more normalized deployment rate and spend rate, we're going to be extremely well positioned with those Verizon sites to capture that on a retail basis, if you will. And then Sprint, again, not as active as the other 3, but again, also pent-up demand, we think, to work on their network as the next few quarters play out. Although we're not seeing the applications quite yet, we expect to see some more from Sprint as we go forward. And then lastly, I mentioned the industry verticals. These are the rural carriers, the ISPs, government agencies, industries that we serve, such as the oil and gas industry and others, that will welcome a smooth and easy application process to get on these Verizon sites. So again, we've got 11 months to run our first full year, and those are the sources that I feel will add to the demand for the Verizon towers."

And we had done that about 2 years ago. But the assets that we've acquired over the last 2 years were very compelling, and we would expect significant returns coming from those. And so until we get our balance sheet back to where we think it's stable, which is at that south of 5x, we're going to continue to repay that debt and, again, provide that footing for us going forward. It's not to preclude us from looking at opportunities going forward.

It's technology and economically prohibitive to serve the U.S. population widely with small cells for this purpose. And the technical reasons are, again, that most of the U.S. population lives in places with population densities of less than 5,000 people per square mile. And you need about 10,000 people per square mile, in our view, to make a small cell deployment, even in conjunction with an overarching macro cell deployment on top of it, economically and technically feasible, right. And so just to go down a couple of the factors. On the technology piece, the hand-off requirement from places where our towers serve people, which are often around highways and other transportation corridors, suburban or rural, if you've got people traveling 30 to 60 miles an hour, you can't really have sufficient hand-off capability over a very large stretch of multi-mile roadway to economically provide those hand-offs. Secondly, your signal needs to cover more ground. It has to be elevated, and therefore it kind of obviates the architecture of small cells when you get into the suburban and rural environment. And again, to put that all in context, the notion of where our towers are and where small cells make sense is really important. So in areas of 10,000 people per square mile or above, we've only got about 0.5% of our tower base in those areas. If you go to 5,000 people or above, we've only got about 5% total of our towers in those places. So our towers serve people in suburbs, rural areas and transportation corridors, where, again, technically and economically, the small cells don't make sense. I'd like to give you a couple of points on the economics. You've got to have a fiber connection to every small cell. So if you're going to try to cover the roadway from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, where the marathon starts, all the way to Boylston Street, you need hundreds and hundreds of small cells to do that. You'd need 26 miles of fiber just to do one road. And that's one of many, many roads that go from west to east in our area. It's just is an economically infeasible opportunity. And you also need, by the way, siting costs. Wherever you put your small cell, you usually have to pay somebody, whether it's the town, the utility, have a revenue share. The economics just, again, don't make sense once you get outside, in our view, of about 10,000 people per square mile. So in dense urban, absolutely, small cells are going to happen. Their growth rates are going to be high because small cells are a very small proportion of the gigabit per month delivery of the network today. And so it's going to grow faster, and we've shown and said that in some of our previous technology briefings. But the bulk of the spending and the bulk of the traffic is still, in our view, for years to come, going to be carried by the macro site because that's where most of the people are."

And I would expect that they would want to have the same type of customer experience in Mexico that they have in the United States. So we're very hopeful that we'll be seeing some of that build and some of that activity probably in the latter half of the year. With regards to what América Móvil is doing in terms of the split out of their sites, I think time will tell in terms of the impact in the marketplace, in terms of are they going to be aggressively marketing those sites or not? Will they ultimately be putting that -- those sites up for sale or not? It's very difficult to tell at this point in time, but we think that overall, Simon, that it's going to open up the entire market and it will compel the competition in the market to more aggressively spend in the market. As I've said over the last year or so, given all the activity that's going on in the market relative to América Móvil and now AT&T, the market for us has been relatively sleepy. From a core organic growth rate, it's been below 10% for us, whereas the prior couple of years before that, the core organic growth rate was quite extensive. So I think that there has been some underspend in that market over the last 24 months. And I think once the -- some of these issues get put to bed, I'm hopeful that we'll start to see some really solid organic growth rate over the next 18 to 24 months."

That's kind of our core technical assumption in the U.S. and that drives our long-term projection for the business here. In Mexico, the entry of AT&T, we believe, is going to accelerate that pattern in Mexico. So there's essentially very limited or no 4G service in the Mexican market today. Our expectation is that AT&T will prompt that technology addition into the market, and now you'll have 100 million people in Mexico that will be on a track, whether it's by the end of this decade or by the middle of the next decade, to have most of its population on 4G at 3 to 5 gigabits a month service. And so we see this as a real catalyst for Mexico for the next 5- to 10-year period that AT&T is going to bring its level of quality, its level of consumer delivery of gigabits a month, or close to that level at least, from the U.S. to Mexico."

Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda fo",783,"Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our financial and operational performance for the second quarter as well as our full year outlook for 2015. And then, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss the organic growth and returns being generated by our key international markets and how our diversified portfolio of assets positions us to drive compelling returns for shareholders well into the future. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2015 outlook and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our future growth, industry trends, anticipated contributions of recently closed our position and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and any other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our second quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 14.8% from the second quarter of 2014 to over $1.15 billion. As we previewed for you during our first quarter earnings call, we expect the domestic revenue growth in the second quarter to be impacted unfavorably by the timing of revenue recognition of our customer decommissioning agreement. This did, in fact, occur and the $5 million decline in decommissioning revenue recorded in the second quarter versus the prior year period brought down our consolidated organic core growth by approximately 70 basis points and our domestic organic core growth by about 100 basis points. 
During the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew 11.7% to approximately $762 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased 13.3% to approximately $537 million. During the quarter, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by approximately $100 million to about $129 million or $0.31 per basic and $0.30 per diluted common share. The contributing factors to the year-over-year decline in net income with the losses we incurred on the early refinement of certain long-term debt obligations which we refinanced during the quarter, an increase in our depreciation expense from the addition of about 25,000 new assets we acquired or built over the last year and the preferred dividends relating to our recently issued mandatory convertible preferred stock. Adjusting for the onetime impact of the loss on retirement of long-term obligations, net income for common and diluted share would have been approximately $0.48 for the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of approximately 4,700 sites from Airtel in Nigeria for approximately $1.09 billion, including VAT. Approximately $736 million of the consideration was paid in July, and we expect that the remainder will be paid to Airtel on or before January 15, 2016. In addition, we've completed all of the necessary steps to file a tax election, pursuant to which the GTP REIT for Federal and state income tax purposes will no longer operate as a separate REIT. You may recall that we highlighted this as an opportunity when we announced the transaction nearly 2 years ago, and we are pleased to be in a position to complete this important tax process. As a result, we expect to incur approximately $92 million in onetime cost in the second half of the year, which will lead to several long-term financial and operational benefits for American Tower. These benefits include more efficient cash management, increased cash flow potential, allowing us greater flexibility to fund operations and future growth, enhancement of customer relationships through contract simplification and improved business alignment in addition to eliminating the complication cost and risks associated with managing a subsidiary NAREIT. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss the results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a solid second quarter, exceeding our earlier expectations for growth in revenue, margins and AFFO across the business. We are progressing well with the integration of the nearly 11,500 Verizon",2303,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a solid second quarter, exceeding our earlier expectations for growth in revenue, margins and AFFO across the business. We are progressing well with the integration of the nearly 11,500 Verizon towers we added in the first quarter and are pleased with their performance so far. We acquired about 4,200 sites in Brazil from Telecom Italia at the end of April and most recently added around 4,700 towers in Nigeria from Airtel in July 1. We expect to acquire the remaining 2,300-or-so sites in Brazil from TIM and up to an additional 200 sites in Nigeria from Airtel over the next 12 months or so. Our strategy of pursuing international investments to strengthen and extend our consolidated growth rate is delivering results, and we are pleased with the benefits we are experiencing due to the scale we have added to our international business. We believe these international investments will continue to help drive returns significantly above those of our U.S. business. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 6. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 15% to approximately $1.2 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was over 23%, and of this core growth, over 7% was organic or about 8% excluding our U.S. decommissioning revenues. The balance of our core growth [indiscernible] was attributable to profits we've added since the beginning of last year, including more than 12,000 in each of our domestic and international segments. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management segment generated core growth in revenue of about 21% during the second quarter, with organic core growth in revenue of 5.8% or nearly 7% excluding our U.S. decommissioning revenues. T-Mobile and Verizon led the way in terms of both new leases and amendments in Q2 and continue to comprise the bulk of our new business pipeline. As expected, we saw a sequential improvement in signed new business trends during the quarter, with signed new business increasing over 50% from Q1. Overall, our U.S. business continues to deliver good performance with organic growth for the year expected to be right around the midpoint of our long-term target range. Our new Verizon sites are also delivering solid results and are performing in line with our expectations. 
Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by about 16% on both the reported and core basis to $621 million and reflected a 61% revenue conversion rate. Excluding the Verizon sites, this conversion rate would have been approximately 90%. We constructed 12 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on nearly 500 ground leases, with extensions averaging about 29 years. Including the new Verizon sites, around 62% of the land under our U.S. towers is now either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we are targeting to achieve 80% in the next 5 years. We also enhanced our domestic small cell offering and add nearly 300 domestic indoor DAS systems online. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown this portfolio nearly 11%, adding 32 new systems since the second quarter of last year. We are pleased with the performance of these systems and have been able to obtain average indoor DAS tenancies of about 2.2, with an NOI yield of nearly 16%. DAS, in combination with our managed rooftop business, represents about 6% of our U.S. revenues and add revenue growth of over 25% in the quarter. 
Our U.S. segment, including towers and managed networks, generated reported and core domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 17%. This reflects strong revenue growth, our continuing focus on property level cost controls and SG&A as a percentage of revenue of around 4%. We're also managing the integration of the Verizon portfolio efficiently and have added less SG&A to date as compared to levels we initially contemplated for the transaction. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rail and management segment had a solid quarter, with core growth of about 28% and organic core growth in revenue of nearly 12%. Reported revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation effects of about $80 million from the prior year period. We saw strong demand for sites across our portfolio with markets such as India, Brazil and Mexico, all generating double-digit growth in signed new business over the prior year period. Large, investment-grade tenants like Airtel, Vodafone and Telefonica continue to generate the majority of our international revenues and organic new business growth. In Mexico, for example, AT&T has been our top new business customer so far this year. And in Latin America as a whole, AT&T and Telefonica now comprise nearly 50% of our revenues. We also continue to invest in our existing markets through new tower construction and built more than 900 new towers across our international footprint in Q2. In India, we built over 600 sites during the quarter for operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. We built over 150 sites in Brazil to support the needs of ViVo and TIM and are continuing to see newbuild activity ramp significantly in that market. We've built an additional 61 towers in Ghana and Uganda us well during the quarter, with NTN as our anchored tenant. Simultaneously, we're investing in small cells not only in the U.S. but also in our international markets, where we think the indoor opportunity may even be greater. In fact, in just the last year, we have grown our international indoor DAS asset base more than 50%, and we now have more than 125 systems installed. Our international indoor DAS portfolio is performing well and is already delivering an NOI yield comparable to that of the U.S. indoor DAS portfolio. We continue to view indoor DAS as a good compliment to our core global macro tower business and remain focused on deploying capital to multitenant small cell solutions in all of our markets where it makes financial sense. 
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 5% to about $222 million, while core growth in gross margin was around 33%. Our reported international rental and management segment's operating profit grew more than 8% to $192 million, and the operating profit margin improved about 340 basis points over the second quarter of last year to nearly 55%. Excluding pass-through revenue, this segment's operating margin grew to 75%, which is up from 70% generated for Q2 of last year. Our core growth in international operating profit was 40% for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 11.7% with core growth of over 21%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 65%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was about 71%, and the adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio was about 57%. This was impacted by both the timing of the decommissioning revenue in the U.S. and the addition of the Verizon and TIM Brazil assets to the base. Excluding these impacts, our adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio would have been around 90% due to our legacy site revenue outperformance and solid expense management during the quarter. Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was under 8%, and for the full year, we expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be around 8.5% as we absorb the cost associated with the launch of our newest market in Nigeria. Longer term, we would expect our SG&A as a percentage of revenues to decline as we drive organic growth across the portfolio. Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased over 13% to $537 million or $1.26 per share. Core AFFO growth was over 25%, and our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio during the quarter was just under 80%. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Given the performance of the business, we are raising our full year outlook for rental and management revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our new outlook does not include the 2,300 sites from TIM in Brazil or the 200 towers from Airtel in Nigeria yet to be closed. We now expect 2015 rental and management segment revenue of about $4.67 billion at the midpoint. The increase is driven by about $110 million in additional rental revenue from Airtel Nigeria assets, including about $30 million in past-due revenue as well as about $10 million of legacy international outperformance. This growth is being partially offset by around $15 million of negative foreign currency translation effects relative to our prior outlook and a reduction of approximately $15 million in U.S. noncash straight-line revenue recognition. For the year, we now expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 23%, which includes organic core growth expectations of about 7% and nearly 10.5% for our domestic and international segments, respectively. On a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 organic core growth in revenue to be around 8%. 
In addition, we are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $30 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the new assets we've added to our portfolio, complemented by international organic revenue outperformance and solid cost controls globally of about $22 million. This is partially offset by the U.S. straight-line revenue reduction I just mentioned and about $7 million in unfavorable FX translation effects relative to our prior outlook. We now expect core growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 21%. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO outlook at the midpoint by $60 million. This is being driven by about $30 million in incremental cash EBITDA from the Airtel Nigeria assets and around $17 million in incremental cash EBITDA from legacy sites. In addition, we now expect net cash interest expense and cash taxes collectively to be $15 million lower than our prior outlook. And this is being partially offset by a few million dollars in negative foreign currency translation effects versus our prior AFFO outlook. Our AFFO growth is expected to be about 17% for the year or about 25% on a core basis. As a result, our AFFO per share growth is forecasted to be over 10% or nearly 18% on a core basis, inclusive of the impact of our financing transactions completed during the year. Consequently, we now expect to reach $5 per share in AFFO at the midpoint. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, which we believe will support our business in generating consistent, robust growth in a variety of business and economic cycles. We are focused on simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've invested nearly $7 billion [ph] through our M&A program, declared about $400 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed over $300 million in CapEx. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and our growing dividends will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in our REIT distribution of at least 20%, which is actually averaged around 30% over the last 12 months. Our payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is currently over 30% and is expected to grow to over 40% within the next few years due to anticipated growth in our taxable income and the reduction of our net operating losses. We also seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and pro forma for the the Airtel Nigeria acquisition purchase price had nearly $2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to opportunistically extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of around 5.5 years with an average interest cost of about 3.5%. We took steps towards achieving this in the second quarter by refinancing securitized notes assumed through our acquisition of GTP in 2013 and by issuing senior notes to term out revolver borrowings. Secured debt now composes around 20% of our total debt, and we expect to end 2015 with net leverage mid-5x range and anticipate reaching 5x leverage or below by the end of 2016. Longer term, our target leverage rates continues to be between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This solid financial platform will continue to give us the flexibility to invest in the most compelling global, multitenant commercial real estate opportunities well into the future. 
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. We started 2015 with a solid first half and believe we're well positioned to leverage our global asset base to drive strong growth throughout the rest of 2015. We are again raising our 2015 outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO and similar to last year, expect core growth in all 3 metrics to be above our long-term targets, all over 20%. By year-end, we anticipate having nearly 100,000 sites worldwide with the solid the balance sheet, ample liquidity and manageable leverage in the mid-5x range. Trends across global footprint, particularly in our international markets, continue to be favorable. Mobile voice and data usage is increasing rapidly. Advanced handsets are becoming more affordable for more and more people, and carriers are monetizing incremental usage and generating solid returns. Our disciplined capital allocation process has positioned us to benefit from the strengths on a global basis, and we expect to utilize our industry-leading portfolio and financial position to drive compelling returns for our stockholders for many years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As demonstrated by the second quarter results and updated outlook, both our domestic and our international segments continue to perform well. This performance is a result of a combination of accelerating data demand across our markets and the scale, diversification and quality of our global tower and small cell distributed antenna system portfolios. 
As Tom mentioned, we've updated our U.s. operation significantly with the addition of the Verizon tower assets earlier this year. I have participated in some of the initial sites inspections myself and have been in close touch with our U.S. team. And the team, with integration is Verizon portfolio, is solidly on track, and the new business pipeline on the tower is shaping up nicely. Consequently, our experience to date with the Verizon tower is confirming our valuation assumptions on the attractiveness of the sites location, pent-up demand for both colocation and amendment activity and the quality of those assets. We expect that the addition of the Verizon portfolio will further strengthen our domestic growth profile and operational performance for many years to come. 
Consistent with my prepared remarks from past year's second quarter call, my focus this morning will be on our international segment, where we're seeing outperformance relative to our initial projections for the year. After a very brief recap of our international investment philosophy, I'll discuss the key current and future trends in our largest international markets and then review our extensive track record of generating outsized growth and return on investment internationally, while discussing our confidence in being able to replicate this performance on our newly-acquired assets as well. 
This has been a long journey. Over the last 15 years, we've carefully selected a series of markets, interconnected through a strong core of common, multinational customers, solid underpinning of world's property rights and long-term wireless industry growth potential. The markets where 4G is being deployed, like the U.S. and Germany, some markets where additional voice networks are still being built out such as India, we're positioned to benefit from carrier investments in both the short and the long term. In developing and emerging markets, this growth will be supported by several key factors. First, wireless carriers in these markets continue to generate healthy margins and return on investment despite ARPUs, or average revenue per user per month, appear to be lower on the surface. For example, in India where per-SIM ARPU was around $3, average wireless carrier EBITDA is still over 30%. This is attributable to the typically customer behavior in that country where utilize multiple SIM cards to power their devices often from different wireless carriers. Moreover, leading mobile operators in markets such as India also takes full advantage of low-cost inputs such as labor and modest, if any, handset subsidies. Similarly, in Brazil, where the ARPU is around $8, mobile operator EBITDA margins are also above 30%. This is especially notable given that in the U.S. wer ARPUs are in the $50 range, CAGR EBITDA margins are similar to this much lower ARPU markets. As a result, we continue to believe that the mobile network operators across our served markets have the financial capacity to make meaningful investments in the network, resulting in incremental equipment in our towers and ongoing revenue growth opportunities for us. Simultaneously, the middle class in these markets, along with its buying power, is growing substantially. More importantly, smartphone prices, as Tom said, are coming down. There are now a number of smartphones available internationally in the $100 range, which adds about 70% to 80% of functionality of a device that would sell for $700 or $800 in the United States. With increasing incomes, more and more people are now able to afford one of these advanced devices while also being able to pay more for a data plan. This historical analysis have shown getting more advanced devices in the hands of consumers leads to more usage on wireless networks. In turn, it's the carriers benefit from increasing ARPUs from those smartphone users, they're able to redeploy that cash into investments to further support network quality. 
India is a prime example of a market where we believe it will be a very long runway of wireless network investment, accompanied by strong organic growth for our 14,000-site portfolio there. The smartphone penetration is just 10%. A population of over 1.2 billion people and minimal access to wireline, cable, fiber or satellite-based alternatives, mobile is poised to be the primary method of communication and entertainment for the future. Today, 85 to 90% of Indian mobile phone users are still on 2G, and there remains a significant portion of the rural cooperation with no access at all. We're working with public and private sector partners in India to develop innovative concepts like the digital town square where the tower is the centerpiece. The digital town square concept brings together electrical power, Internet connectivity, site security, educational kiosk connected to the Internet and mobile service by our customers to support the Indian government's digital India plan. We believe this cannot only accelerate bringing mobile phones and Internet service to underserved rural populations, but it also provide us at American Tower with some great opportunities for incremental tower built investments, which have historically generated our highest return on invested capital. 
Brazil is another market where we expect to generate very strong growth in both the short and long term. Around key population centers like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are more than 16,000 Brazilian sites, provide our tenants with the real estate they need to respond rapidly growing usage across their networks. With over 4,000 SIM cards per cell sites, or about double that of the United States, Brazilian networks are extremely congested and increasing mobile data usage is compounding the issue. If smartphone prices continue to drop, penetration climbed and today extends over 35% as compared to under 10% of smartphone penetration just 5 years ago in Brazil. Furthermore, industry projects this call for more data usage to grow proximately eightfold in Brazil over the next few years, prompting the leading mobile operators in the country to recommit significant network investment. These include the local Telefónica unit TiVo and Telecom Italia mobile, or TIM, for whom we recently acquired about 4,200 sites in April. 
The story is similar throughout our other markets within our international footprint. In Mexico, AT&T has recently announced $3 billion investment, and América Móvil recently announced $6 billion investment both the excellent opportunities for us given our portfolio position there. In South Africa, Vodafone, Telcom and Cell-C are all actively rolling out and their 3G networks as the population continues to increasingly consume mobile data in that country. And in markets like Nigeria and Ghana, both 2G and 3G rollouts are happening concurrently. 
To be in a position to benefit from these types of trends, we have built a diversified international business with a long track record of generating compelling returns. It's important to [indiscernible] numbers, some real facts, so let's run through key specific examples. I'll start in Brazil where over the last 3 years, organic core revenue growth has averaged more than 12% or 400 basis points or so higher than the U.S. equivalent. Since our entry into the market in the year 2000, we have focused on building and acquiring high-quality towers and [indiscernible] This is evidenced by our ability to drive leasing activity. On Brazilian sites that we've constructed or acquired between the year 2000 and 2005, for example, we have averaged nearly 3 tenants and a local currency NOI yield approaching 50% or well over 30% on a dollar basis taking into account changes in foreign currency. For the 2005 to 2010 vintage in Brazil, we have nearly 2 tenants for tower and an average local currency NOI yield of almost 30% and a U.S. dollar yield of more than 20%. So as you can see with the performance of our longest tenure vintages, the more time that we independently own and operate a tower asset, the higher tenancy and return profile of that asset tends to become. This is repeatable in all other markets. In Mexico, our international market was the longest tenure. We have generated organic core growth rates averaging nearly 10% over the last 3 years. Going back to the 2000 and 2005 vintage in Mexico, for example, it generates NOI yield of more than 30% on both the local currency and the U.S. dollar basis, with an average tenancy of over 2.0. For assets in Mexico added to the portfolio between 2005 and 2010, we're also generating approximately 30% NOI yields with over 2 tenants per tower on average. We now anticipate significant incremental new business in Mexico from AT&T, América Móvil and other mobile operators as a competitive environment in that market becomes increasingly dynamic and 4G is aggressively introduced. If it is estimated at for a robust, near-nationwide 4G network to cover Mexico's population, at least twice as many cell sites that currently exist will be required there. 
Turning to South Africa where we started doing business only in 2011. Organic core revenue growth rates for us there have averaged almost 15%. While our consolidated, local currency NOI yield sit at nearly 26%. For the U.S. dollar equivalent, it's about 19% there. aggressively spent capital to improve an extended their networks and a significant portion of those investments has resulted in incremental equipment being placed on our South African real estate. 
In India, we experienced average organic revenue growth of over 10% in the past year, including nearly 14% in the second quarter. On a 3-year basis, the average has been around 9%. We've been able to generate solid return on our assets in India since entering the market. For the 2005 to 2010 vintage in India, for example, local currency NOI yields are about 12%, with a U.S. dollar equivalent at more than 10% and the average tendency above 2.0 per tower. And precisely that since 2010, which have all been build-to-suits, the yields are actually even higher at around 20% with an average tenancy of 1.7 or so. Currently in India, Idea, Vodafone, Bharti and the other major carriers there are reaccelerating their spending after gaining increased clarity with respect to spectrum positions and the regulatory environment in that country. 
And finally, in Nigeria, we're already seeing indications of very strong demand as we convert formerly captive, underutilized Airtel assets into the multitenant commercial real estate leasing model. With the largest population in Africa, very limited fixed line infrastructure, a competitive wireless sector and a massive need for better networks, we believe we can aggressively add tenants to our portfolio of approximately 4,700 sites there. Given our required return hurdles in Nigeria, even with 1 tenant, these assets have an NOI yield of over 8%. And by adding just one more tenant, we believe we can grow those yields to 17% or more. This illustrates the huge potential we see in this market. 
In closing, our focus has always been and will continue to be leverage our international operations to extend and prolong our ability to drive compelling, consistent, long-term stockholder returns. We have an extensive track record and a great team putting together great deployment of these assets and delivering really great high organic growth rates, and consequently, higher NOI yields to our investors. Importantly, a significant portion of our current International portfolio is comprised of sites that we have added over just the last few years, which we expect will complement over high-performing U.S. business with even greater growth rates for an extended period of time.

One aspect of this is that this emergent middle class that has developed in Brazil over, say, the last 5 years or so, 5- to 10-year time period is stabilizing. One of the government's major goals was -- portrayed to us was that they didn't want backlighting from people who made it in middle class to backslide into a lower social economic situation. And they feel they've been fairly successful in that. So that middle class is really the core customer for the 3 and 4G handset. It's a good sell in that $100 mark, and the ARPU is going from, call it, $8 to $10 or $12. These people can afford that, which is really important. However, the government also recognize that it's time to sort of give back to business, if you will, and the global economic situation is stable enough for them to do that. And I think with the new Finance Minister in place and government policies that he and the President are implementing implementing, you're going to see a comeback by Brazil over the next few years, sort of on a larger scale. So we think it's very supportive. And the last point I'll make about Brazil is, who are these mobile operators? They're global, multinational, very well-capitalized companies with long-term views of their business, and they're stepping up their investment in this market even while it may be sort of downtick during the in-country metrics."

One is, we don't put anything in the guidance until we see applications in the office in Mexico City or in Hoover Mass or whatever the operations team is accepting those around the world. So you're absolutely right that we don't have anything significant in the guidance that time Tom just laid out and probably won't see that the significant impacts until 2016 because the pace has to come in. We got to process them, price them, negotiate with the client, et cetera. That's a few months process before the notice we receive with equipment installation comes through and we start building. So 2016, I guess, is the prime time to see the full benefits of the increasing competitive nature in the Mexican global market. But what's already clear is the value that AT&T and América Móvil have publicly stated they're putting on ramping up their networks. And I mentioned earlier their public statements are $3 billion and $6 billion, respectively, investments over the next few years. That's going to be a sizable increase in the CapEx devoted to Mexican mobile networks. And all of our aggression analyses in the U.S. and elsewhere say when that happens, we should have positive revenue upside. But until we see those actual plans and have the MLA firmly in place and can model that based on deployment plan we get from our customer, we won't be able to quantify it quite yet."

And I can sort of encapsulate the core elements of public statements our customers have made for you as they apply to our business.

And I can sort of encapsulate the core elements of public statements our customers have made for you as they apply to our business. So just run down the 4 major carriers quickly, and you can let me know if there's a follow-up you like. And I'll just start with Verizon. What they are doing right now is enhancing their network and the regarding data load that it's carrying based on your 4G service products by deploying AWS spectrum throughout the country and on many, if not most, maybe someday almost all the sites. AWS spectrum is a much higher frequency, of course, than the 700 megahertz spectrum that's the foundation of the Verizon 4G network. And so we're seeing as a consequence of that additional trend by Verizon towards colocating on brand-new towers that they haven't had equipment on the past with us. That means their results putting going on probably because of, I would imagine, capacity requirements but also driven in large part by the fact that the sites just need to be closer together because spectrum is higher and don't travel as far. So I think that's one of the keys there. The next phase for the Verizon will be to reform their 1900 PCS spectrum from 3 to 4G. [ph] I think that will continue the phenomenon there. Their CapEx spending has been pretty stable. I do believe Verizon's network planning offers team, which is excellent and we know well, has the confidence of the corporation to continue to spend at a level of their spending and reinvest in at network, which is pretty high-performing right now. Turning to T-Mobile. They're going the opposite direction in aggressively deploying A block spectrum of the 700-megahertz band, which means additional equipment on a lot of site there. We are transmitting from so we see relatively more amendments from them as an example because they're going from a network of that that was designed to run higher-frequency spectrum and augmenting that with the 700 and then fill it in, I think, in phases 2 and 3 beyond that over the next 2 years, but that's much of what they're doing now. The other interesting thing is our space where T-Mobile is their success gaining customers on their marketing side because they're adding subscribers. Some of the subscribers are then bringing up the usage in places where T-Mobile use the room on others' carriers networks. And as a result of that increasing revenue opportunity, by being successful in the subscriber marketplace, the business case for T-Mobile is start building up their own network assets in places where they used to pay their competitors to carry their traffic. The jargon in our industry for that is a roaming overbuild. We're seeing that in some areas of the country from T-Mobile, which help also drive new business with us, and those, of course, tend to be new leases in those cases. Turning to AT&T, we have a holistic agreement with AT&T that's run a few years now designed to give them a steady opportunity to continue to deploy equipment on our sites under that agreement and they are. Other benefit for that agreement for us is when they're in a period, as they are now, you'll recall that 18 to 12 months ago, AT&T was doing really outside investment in their network. When you have an outside investment, you tend to have a little bit longer grooming periods to get that investment within the network to perfectly see how it performs and then you go into another reinvestment cycle. We're in the trough of that now, but our holistic agreement keeps their revenues with us pretty steady. One interesting fact that AT&T has disclosed is that their smartphone ARPU is doubled that of non-smartphone ARPU. And now they're to a point where they're really aggressively transitioning as [indiscernible] almost all of their investor base to smartphones and then upgrade those smartphones as well. This rolling sort of compounding network demand is going to continue. And that's just an interesting data point for us that they talk about it as mobile operator, which is when somebody does that conversion, their ARPU doubles and usage goes up, too, when their ARPU doubles and it allows them to reinvest to support that customer. And Sprint is still in the -- we expect final planning stages. Now they're going to go to their network reinvestment cycle, and we'll be closely working with them on that. But at the moment, again, with the holistic agreement in place, we have a steady and stable revenue trajectory from Sprint over the last few years. That continues, and we're looking forward to see if there's upside to that when the rollout plan comes out. Amir, does that cover your question?"

And on the discretionary, we see a bit of a mixed trend difference in terms of our build-to-suits. And so the biggest piece of the discretionary or the decline in CapEx is in our developments part of the budget. And while we're still going to be building, we expect in the kind of that 3,000 range, we expect more of those sites to be built outside of the United States than inside in the United States. And so as a result, given that the cost to build is lower outside the United States, we are taking down our overall discretionary build."

It's probably time for someone else to pop in. But let me speak quickly on Verizon. As any other large asset acquisition in our space by any of the peer group, there's an integration period that needs to happen. We got the sites and the site information and data on sort of day one of the closing, and we get the right market those sites the others clearly not have felt that had access to them in the past. And so there's a ramp-up period to get to, if you will, full leasing speed. It's like accelerating a car from 0 to 60. So what we are seeing is the first sort of 6 months or 3 to 6 months of what we expected to happen during that initial launch of acceleration period is indeed happening. There's a lot of pent-up demand, both literally applications around Verizon's regions that were sort of in drawers and files to be processed. We've gotten all those and we hope more speedily implementing those applications than otherwise have been. And as we've already got another 400, 500 that have come in over -- through our sales force since we've got the sites. So for this stage of a 0-to-60 acceleration, we feel we're at where we need to be. In addition to that, our initial SG&A review is showing that wel probably come in under the SG&A we thought we needed to add American Tower to manage these sites. So by -- again, the end of the first full year of owning and operating the Verizon site, we see ourselves bringing in the new business and revenue that we thought, at least that much. And we also see us underspending on the cost side as well. We'll finish of this integration process and be up to the sort of 60 miles an hour speed in the first half of 2016 some time. We got 12,000 sites to do. I've been out for some of the site visits. These are extensive and thorough as they should be. And when we get that site visit done and get all the information and drawings into our systems done, we're ready to go and lease that site quickly and that's our goal. So that's where we are in Verizon, and I would say at or on that trajectory of speed that we hoped for at this point. Core organic growth in the international markets, India and Brazil are outperforming as are some others, but those are the 2 biggest ones with the most impact. As far as small cells, I'm going to give you the short answer. I've got a very extensive one someday for you when we're together, David, based on our entire strategy of just 3 strategic pillars that we in place when I got here in sort of 2001. And those are to reach sufficient asset scale to drive performance and whatever asset class we participate in. To drive superior operational execution to stay margins within those assets, at the same time, maintain a strong financial position. So those are still our goals. We are an investor in small cells, by the way. We're the largest player both in the U.S. and outside, to my knowledge, in the independent third-party provisioning indoor antenna system, which we think are the best-performing, fast-growth, most locatable and highest-margin types of small cells that we're aware of so far, and we're evaluating everything else. As the individual transactions, we don't have visibility to the details behind those. I can't speak to them. But we're an active player on this. We're looking at every asset class. We're going to break those asset classes into those 3 categories and on our expected ability to drive growth and returns. And we're looking at all those asset classes. At the moment, we're very focused on U.S. macro towers, international macro towers, indoor DAS systems, and there may be more to come based on our ongoing assessment."

And again, it's just a function of increased tenancy, which as Jim said, is just an increase of what we're seeing organically going on in those markets. I mean, India grew 14%. You've got May overall grow 14%. In Mexico, while AT&T hasn't started its program, we saw a pickup in Mexico, which as I said before, has been a little bit sleepy over the last couple of years. And even the first quarter, it's about 5% and went up to about 7%. So we saw an uptick in that market as well. So we're seeing at globally. And with regards to your second question on driving the straight line, we reviewed contracts associated with some recent contract extensions that we've done at the end of last year and determined that there were some leases that were not straight line-able and maybe made judgments our expectations for noncash straight line revenues. We do that regularly and review the methodology and discover that we just needed to make the adjustment for the year."

So we've had a team evaluating EMEA and specifically Western Europe since 2007. And some conclusions that they did so far make it sound investments that for us a little bit more challenging, let's say, and those some of the structural issues. So without going into all the technical details, the towers themselves in most of the markets and the German sites that we have bought from a year, 1.5 years, 2 years ago, are built into this category tend to be very short structurally, really only designed for the individual one carrier that put it up. The other issue sometimes in some of these consequences the governments have mandated network swapping or noncommercial sharing, which then takes away some of the upside. So we have to put these kinds of structural and regulatory elements into our assessment. Therefore, again, it's a tougher investment case for us in countries with a lot of the assets. The other side of the equation because these are short, small single lease towers when there is industry consolidation in terms of carriers going from, say, 5 to 4, 4 to 3 in a country in Europe, they're going to want to try to rationalize some of those towers, which makes the hurdle for investment in the towers potentially even higher. So the structural and regulatory issues raised the bar for us, so to speak, in many investments scenarios in Western Europe. However, the one exception we did find so far was the Germany. We anticipated the merger of Deutsche Telekom and B+ -- I'm sorry, merger of Telefónica asset there and B+ kind of the business model we knew it was coming so it doesn't really affect the business case. In that situation, we're able to meet our growth and return on investment combination that we see but less growth and more return on investment upfront and all the Math work for us. So we're going to keep looking for those, but I'm not sure we're going to be sort of the market leader under current conditions in Western Europe although we're going to keep at it."

There's differentiation between indoor DAS performance that we've seen in outdoor DAS. And so our tenancies in the indoor DAS, which we view as much more colocatable for a host of technical reasons, which we don't have time to get through right now. And that's been born out in the actual feedback on this sites and systems we have up and running. So our tenancy DAS is over 2. Just like towers, you expect we've been running it for 5 or more years that over 2 customers for towers, say, in the U.S. and that's our experience with indoor DAS. Outdoor DAS is younger. It isn't there yet, but we're finding the lease upgrade, frankly, to be slower. There's not 100% overlap between all the carriers on it on initial design, so you don't have 100% of the lease opportunity. And the ODAS tends to be much more expensive to put and they're, therefore, more expensive to the carrier from a rental perspective, and it's a harder decision for them. Our gross margins with indoor das systems, again right up there with towers, 75% in the U.S. and return on invested capital in the same ballpark as towers 16%. So mid- to high-double-digit returns. Indoor DAS is meeting our investment criteria, the same store investment criteria we have on U.S. micro towers and international macro towers and that's what we focus. We are seeking to find other type of small cell assets in the asset class that we didn't have confidence to reach these kinds of metrics and we're going to continue to search for those. As far as the ultimate opportunity in indoor DAS, it's probably an outfield opportunity with towers. Can you get the 3 tenants over a period of time? It's the logical thing that you can. So that would be what we would see. Secondly, you said you talk about a number of sort of additional opportunities to drive leasing. Those are all there. We don't put them again into our guidance until they're actually in place. Applications based on those are coming in. It's hard to speculate on them individually, but they're all constructive for the long-term trajectory of you asked our demand cycle. That you want to add anything?"

They're very long term.

So all the drivers that are business tend to not be for 1/2 or 1 quarter to come and go, but they tend to be over many years. And that's why when you get some real clarity around the dish spectrum. We don't know when that's going to be we don't know what that's going to view what there is on that deployment. It'll be a long-term benefit in some form for the domestic tower industry.

We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda",783,"Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our financial and operational performance for the second quarter as well as our full year outlook for 2015. And then, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss the organic growth and returns being generated by our key international markets and how our diversified portfolio of assets positions us to drive compelling returns for shareholders well into the future. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2015 outlook and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our future growth, industry trends, anticipated contributions of recently closed acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and in our other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our second quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 14.8% from the second quarter of 2014 to over $1.15 billion. As we previewed for you during our first quarter earnings call, we expect the domestic revenue growth in the second quarter to be impacted unfavorably by the timing of revenue recognition of our customer decommissioning agreement. This did, in fact, occur and the $5 million decline in decommissioning revenue recorded in the second quarter versus the prior-year period brought down our consolidated organic core growth by approximately 70 basis points and our domestic organic core growth by about 100 basis points. 
During the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew 11.7% to approximately $762 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased 13.3% to approximately $537 million. During the quarter, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by approximately $100 million to about $129 million or $0.31 per basic and $0.30 per diluted common share. The contributing factors to the year-over-year decline in net income with the losses we incurred on the early retirement of certain long-term debt obligations, which we refinanced during the quarter, an increase in our depreciation expense from the addition of about 25,000 new assets we acquired or built over the last year and the preferred dividends relating to our recently issued mandatory convertible preferred stock. Adjusting for the onetime impact of the loss on retirement of long-term obligations, net income for common and diluted share would have been approximately $0.48 for the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of approximately 4,700 sites from Airtel in Nigeria for approximately $1.09 billion, including VAT. Approximately $736 million of the consideration was paid in July, and we expect that the remainder will be paid to Airtel on or before January 15, 2016. In addition, we've completed all of the necessary steps to file a tax election, pursuant to which the GTP REIT for Federal and state income tax purposes will no longer operate as a separate REIT. You may recall that we highlighted this as an opportunity when we announced the transaction nearly 2 years ago, and we are pleased to be in a position to complete this important tax planning process. As a result, we expect to incur approximately $92 million in onetime costs in the second half of the year, which will lead to several long-term financial and operational benefits for American Tower. These benefits include more efficient cash management, increased cash flow potential, allowing us greater flexibility to fund operations and future growth, enhancement of customer relationships through contract simplification and improved business alignment in addition to eliminating the complication costs and risks associated with managing a subsidiary REIT. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss the results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a solid second quarter, exceeding our earlier expectations for growth in revenue, margins and AFFO across the business. We are progressing well with the integration of the nearly 11,500 Verizon",2301,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a solid second quarter, exceeding our earlier expectations for growth in revenue, margins and AFFO across the business. We are progressing well with the integration of the nearly 11,500 Verizon towers we added in the first quarter, and are pleased with their performance so far. We acquired about 4,200 sites in Brazil from Telecom Italia at the end of April, and most recently added around 4,700 towers in Nigeria from Airtel in July 1. We expect to acquire the remaining 2,300-or-so sites in Brazil from TIM and up to an additional 200 sites in Nigeria from Airtel over the next 12 months or so. Our strategy of pursuing international investments to strengthen and extend our consolidated growth rate is delivering results, and we are pleased with the benefits we are experiencing due to the scale we have added to our international business. We believe these international investments will continue to help drive returns significantly above those of our U.S. business. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 6. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 15% to approximately $1.2 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was over 23%. And of this core growth, over 7% was organic or about 8% excluding our U.S. decommissioning revenues. The balance of our core growth, or about 16%, was attributable to profits we've added since the beginning of last year, including more than 12,000 in each of our domestic and international segments. 
Turning to Slide 7, our domestic rental and management segment generated core growth in revenue of about 21% during the second quarter, with organic core growth in revenue of 5.8% or nearly 7% excluding our U.S. decommissioning revenues. T-Mobile and Verizon led the way in terms of both new leases and amendments in Q2, and continue to comprise the bulk of our new business pipeline. As expected, we saw a sequential improvement in signed new business trends during the quarter, with signed new business increasing over 50% from Q1. Overall, our U.S. business continues to deliver good performance, with organic growth for the year expected to be right around the midpoint of our long-term target range. Our new Verizon sites are also delivering solid results and are performing in line with our expectations. 
Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by about 16% on both reported and core basis to $621 million and reflected a 61% revenue conversion rate. Excluding the Verizon sites, this conversion rate would have been approximately 90%. We constructed 12 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on nearly 500 ground leases, with extensions averaging about 29 years. Including the new Verizon sites, around 62% of the land under our U.S. towers is now either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we are targeting to achieve 80% in the next 5 years. We also enhanced our domestic small cell offering and have nearly 300 domestic indoor DAS systems online. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown this portfolio nearly 11%, adding 32 new systems since the second quarter of last year. We are pleased with the performance of these systems and have been able to obtain average indoor DAS tenancies of about 2.2, with an NOI yield of nearly 16%. DAS, in combination with our managed rooftop business, represents about 6% of our U.S. revenues and have revenue growth of over 25% in the quarter. 
Our U.S. segment, including towers and managed networks, generated reported and core domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 17%. This reflects strong revenue growth, our continuing focus on property level cost controls and SG&A as a percentage of revenue of around 4%. We're also managing the integration of the Verizon portfolio efficiently and have added less SG&A to date as compared to the levels we initially contemplated for the transaction. 
Moving on to Slide 8, our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter, with core growth of about 28% and organic core growth in revenue of nearly 12%. Reported revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation effects of about $80 million from the prior-year period. We saw strong demand for sites across our portfolio with markets such as India, Brazil and Mexico, all generating double-digit growth in signed new business over the prior-year period. Large, investment-grade tenants like Airtel, Vodafone and Telefónica continue to generate the majority of our international revenues and organic new business growth. In Mexico, for example, AT&T has been our top new business customer so far this year. And in Latin America, as a whole, AT&T and Telefónica now comprise nearly 50% of our revenues. We also continue to invest in our existing markets through new tower construction and built more than 900 new towers across our international footprint in Q2. In India, we've built over 600 sites during the quarter for operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. We've built over 150 sites in Brazil to support the needs of Vivo and TIM and are continuing to see newbuild activity ramp significantly in that market. We've built an additional 61 towers in Ghana and Uganda as well during the quarter, with MTN as our anchored tenant. Simultaneously, we're investing in small cells not only in the U.S., but also in our international markets, where we think the indoor opportunity may even be greater. In fact, in just the last year, we have grown our international indoor DAS asset base more than 50%. We now have over 125 systems installed. Our international indoor DAS portfolio is performing well, and is already delivering an NOI yield comparable to that of the U.S. indoor DAS portfolio. We continue to view indoor DAS as a good complement to our core global macro tower business, and remain focused on deploying capital to multitenant small cell solutions in all of our markets, where it makes financial sense. 
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 5% to about $222 million, while core growth in gross margin was around 33%. Our reported international rental and management segment's operating profit grew more than 8% to $192 million, and the operating profit margin improved about 340 basis points over the second quarter of last year to nearly 55%. Excluding pass-through revenue, this segment's operating margin grew to 75%, which is up from 70% generated of Q2 of last year. Our core growth in international operating profit was 40% for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9, on a consolidated basis, reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 11.7% with core growth of over 21%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 65%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was about 71%, and the adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio was about 57%. This was impacted by both the timing of the decommissioning revenue in the U.S. and the addition of the Verizon and TIM Brazil assets to the base. Excluding these impacts, our adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio would have been around 90% due to our legacy site revenue outperformance and solid expense management during the quarter. Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was under 8%. And for the full year, we expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be around 8.5%, as we absorb the costs associated with the launch of our newest market in Nigeria. Longer term, we would expect our SG&A as a percentage of revenues to decline as we drive organic growth across the portfolio. Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased over 13% to $537 million or $1.26 per share. Core AFFO growth was over 25%, and our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio during the quarter was just under 80%. 
Moving on to Slide 10, given the performance of the business, we are raising our full year outlook for rental and management revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our new outlook does not include the 2,300 sites from TIM in Brazil or the 200 towers from Airtel in Nigeria yet to be closed. We now expect 2015 rental and management segment revenue of about $4.67 billion at the midpoint. The increase is driven by about $110 million in additional rental revenue from Airtel Nigeria assets, including about $30 million in past-through revenue as well as about $10 million of legacy international outperformance. This growth is being partially offset by around $15 million of negative foreign currency translation effects relative to our prior outlook and a reduction of approximately $15 million in U.S. noncash straight-line revenue recognition. For the year, we now expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 23%, which includes organic core growth expectations of about 7% and nearly 10.5% for our domestic and international segments, respectively. On a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 organic core growth in revenue to be around 8%. 
In addition, we are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $30 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the new assets we've added to our portfolio, complemented by international organic revenue outperformance and solid cost controls globally of about $22 million. This is partially offset by the U.S. straight-line revenue reduction I just mentioned and about $7 million in unfavorable FX translation effects relative to our prior outlook. We now expect core growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 21%. 
Turning to Slide 11, we are also raising our full year AFFO outlook at the midpoint by $60 million. This is being driven by about $30 million in incremental cash EBITDA from the Airtel Nigeria assets and around $17 million in incremental cash EBITDA from legacy sites. In addition, we now expect net cash interest expense and cash taxes, collectively, to be $15 million lower than our prior outlook, and this is being partially offset by a few million dollars in negative foreign currency translation effects versus our prior AFFO outlook. Our AFFO growth is expected to be about 17% for the year or about 25% on a core basis. As a result, our AFFO per share growth is forecasted to be over 10% or nearly 18% on a core basis, inclusive of the impact of our financing transactions completed during the year. Consequently, we now expect to reach $5 per share in AFFO at the midpoint. 
Moving on to Slide 12, we remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, which we believe will support our business in generating consistent, robust growth in a variety of business and economic cycles. We are focused on simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've invested nearly $7 billion through our M&A program, declared about $400 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed over $300 million in CapEx. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and our growing dividends will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in our REIT distribution of at least 20%, which is actually averaged around 30% over the last 12 months. Our payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is currently over 30%, and is expected to grow to over 40% within the next few years due to anticipated growth in our taxable income and the reduction of our net operating losses. We also seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and pro forma for the Airtel Nigeria acquisition purchase price had nearly $2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to opportunistically extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of around 5.5 years, with an average interest cost of about 3.5%. We took steps toward achieving this in the second quarter by refinancing securitized notes assumed through our acquisition of GTP in 2013 and by issuing senior notes to term out revolver borrowings. Secured debt now composes around 20% of our total debt, and we expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range and anticipate reaching 5x leverage or below by the end of 2016. Longer term, our target leverage rate continues to be between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This solid financial platform will continue to give us the flexibility to invest in the most compelling global, multitenant commercial real estate opportunities well into the future. 
Turning to Slide 13, and in summary, we started 2015 with a solid first half, and believe we are well-positioned to leverage our global asset base to drive strong growth throughout the rest of 2015. We are, again, raising our 2015 outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO and, similar to last year, expect core growth in all 3 metrics to be above our long-term targets, all over 20%. By year-end, we anticipate having nearly 100,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and manageable leverage in the mid-5x range. Trends across our global footprint, particularly in our international markets, continue to be favorable. Mobile voice and data usage is increasing rapidly. Advanced handsets are becoming more affordable for more and more people, and carriers are monetizing incremental usage and generating solid returns. Our disciplined capital allocation process has positioned us to benefit from these trends on a global basis, and we expect to utilize our industry-leading portfolio and financial position to drive compelling returns for our stockholders for many years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As demonstrated by the second quarter results and updated outlook, both our domestic and international segments continue to perform well. This performance is a result of a combination of accelerating data demand across our markets and the scale, diversification and quality of our global tower and small cell distributed antenna system portfolios. 
As Tom mentioned, we augmented our U.S. operation significantly with the addition of the Verizon tower assets earlier this year. I've participated in some of the initial site inspections myself and have been in close touch with our U.S. team. And the team has the integration of the Verizon portfolio solidly on track, and the new business pipeline on the towers is shaping up nicely. Consequently, our experience to date with the Verizon towers is confirming our valuation assumptions on the attractiveness of those sites' locations, pent-up demand for both collocation and amendment activity and the quality of those assets. We expect that the addition of the Verizon portfolio will further strengthen our domestic growth profile and operational performance for many years to come. 
Consistent with my prepared remarks in past year's second quarter call, my focus this morning will be on our international segment, where we're seeing outperformance relative to our initial projections for the year. After a very brief recap of our international investment philosophy, I'll discuss the key current and future trends in our largest international markets and then review our extensive track record of generating outsized growth and return on investment internationally, while discussing our confidence in being able to replicate this performance on our newly-acquired assets as well. 
This has been a long journey. Over the last 15 years, we've carefully selected a series of markets, interconnected through a strong core of common, multinational customers, solid underpinning of rule of law and property rights and long-term wireless industry growth potential. For markets where 4G is being deployed, like the U.S. and Germany, some markets where additional voice networks are still being built out such as India, we're positioned to benefit from carrier investments in both the short and the long term. In developing and emerging markets, this growth will be supported by several key factors. First, wireless carriers in these markets continue to generate healthy margins and return on investment despite ARPUs, or average revenue per user per month, that appear to be low on the surface. For example, in India, where per-SIM ARPU is around $3, average wireless carrier EBITDA margins are still over 30%. This is attributable to the typical customer behavior in that country, where individuals utilize multiple SIM cards to power their devices, often from different wireless carriers. Moreover, leading mobile operators in markets such as India also take full advantage of low-cost inputs such as labor and modest, if any, handset subsidies. Similarly, in Brazil, where the ARPU is around $8, mobile operator EBITDA margins are also above 30%. This is especially notable given that in the U.S., where ARPUs are in the $50 range, carrier EBITDA margins are similar to these much lower ARPU markets. As a result, we continue to believe that the mobile network operators across our served markets have the financial capacity to make meaningful investments in the network and resulting in incremental equipment on our towers and ongoing revenue growth opportunities for us. Simultaneously, the middle class in these markets, along with its buying power, is growing substantially. While importantly, smartphone prices, as Tom said, are coming down. There are now a number of smartphones available internationally in the $100 range, which adds about 70% to 80% of the functionality of a device that would sell for $700 or $800 in the United States. With increasing incomes, more and more people are now able to afford one of these advanced devices while also being able to pay more for data plans. This historical analysis have shown getting more advanced devices in the hands of consumers leads to more usage on wireless networks. In turn, as the carriers benefit from increasing ARPUs from those smartphone users, they're able to redeploy that cash into investments to further support network quality. 
India's a prime example of a market where we believe there will be a very long runway of wireless network investment, accompanied by strong organic growth for our 14,000-site portfolio there. With smartphone penetration at just 10%, a population of over 1.2 billion people and minimal access to wireline, cable, fiber or satellite-based alternatives, mobile is poised to be the primary method of communication and entertainment for the future. Today, 85% to 90% of Indian mobile phone users are still on 2G, and there remains a significant portion of the rural population with no access at all. We're working with public and private sector partners in India to develop innovative concepts like the digital town square, with the tower as the centerpiece. The digital town square concept brings together electrical power, Internet connectivity, site security, educational kiosk connected to the Internet and mobile service by our customers to support the Indian government's digital India plan. We believe this can not only accelerate bringing mobile voice and Internet service to underserved rural populations, but it'll also provide us at American Tower with some great opportunities for incremental tower build investments, which have historically generated our highest return on invested capital. 
Brazil is another market where we expect to generate very strong growth in both the short and long term. Clustered around key population centers like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are more than 16,000 Brazilian sites, provide our tenants with the real estate they need to respond to rapidly growing usage across their networks. With over 4,000 SIM cards per cell site are about double that of the United States. Brazilian networks are extremely congested, and increasing mobile data usage is compounding the issue. If smartphone prices continue to drop, penetrations climb. And today, it stands over 35% as compared to under 10% of smartphone penetration just 5 years ago in Brazil. Furthermore, industry projections call for more data usage to grow proximately eightfold in Brazil over the next 5 years, prompting the leading mobile operators in that country to recommit significant network investment. These include the local Telefónica unit, Vivo; and Telecom Italia Mobile, or TIM, from whom we recently acquired about 4,200 sites in April. 
The story is similar throughout our other markets within our international footprint. In Mexico, AT&T's recently announced $3 billion investment and América Móvil's recently announced $6 billion investment should both be excellent opportunities for us given our portfolio position there. In South Africa, Vodafone, Telkom and Cell C are all actively rolling out and augmenting their 3G networks as the population continues to increasingly consume mobile data in that country. And in markets like Nigeria and Ghana, both 2G and 3G rollouts are happening concurrently. 
To be in a position of benefit from these types of trends, we have built a diversified international business with a long track record of generating compelling returns. It's important to hear real numbers, some real facts, so let's run through key specific examples. I'll start in Brazil, where over the last 3 years organic core revenue growth has averaged more than 12% or 400 basis points or so higher than the U.S. equivalent. Since our entry into the market in the year 2000, we have focused on building and acquiring high-quality towers and prime locations. This is evidenced by our ability to drive leasing activity. On Brazilian sites that we've constructed or acquired between the year 2000 and 2005, for example, we have averaged nearly 3 tenants and a local currency NOI yield approaching 50% or well over 30% on a dollar basis, taking into account changes in foreign currency. For the 2005 to 2010 vintage in Brazil, we have nearly 2 tenants per tower and an average local currency NOI yield of almost 30% and a U.S. dollar yield of more than 20%. So as you can see, with the performance of our longest tenure vintages, the more time that we independently own and operate a tower asset, the higher the tenancy and return profile of that asset tends to become. This is repeatable in all other markets. In Mexico, our international market was the longest tenure. We have generated organic core growth rates averaging nearly 10% over the last 3 years. Going back to the 2000 and 2005 vintage in Mexico, for example, it generates NOI yields of more than 30% on both the local currency and the U.S. dollar basis, with average tenancy of over 2.0. For assets in Mexico added to the portfolio between 2005 and 2010, we're also generating approximately 30% NOI yields, with over 2 tenants per tower on average. We now anticipate significant incremental new business in Mexico from AT&T, América Móvil and other mobile operators as the competitive environment in that market becomes increasingly dynamic and 4G is aggressively introduced. If it is estimated that for a robust, near-nationwide 4G network to cover Mexico's population, at least twice as many cell sites than currently exist will be required there. 
Turning to South Africa, where we started doing business only in 2011, organic core revenue growth rates for us there have averaged almost 15%, while our consolidated, local currency NOI yield sit at nearly 26%; for the U.S. dollar equivalent, at about 19% there. Carriers have aggressively spent capital to improve and extend their networks, and a significant portion of those investments has resulted in incremental equipment being placed on our South African real estate. 
In India, we've experienced average organic core revenue growth of over 10% in the past year, including nearly 14% in the second quarter. On a 3-year basis, the average has been around 9%. We've been able to generate solid returns on our assets in India since entering the market. For the 2005 to 2010 vintage in India, for example, local currency NOI yields are about 12%, with a U.S. dollar equivalent at more than 10% and the average tenancy above 2.0 per tower. And for sites we've added since 2010, which have all been build-to-suits, the yields are actually even higher at around 20% with an average tenancy of 1.7 or so. Currently in India, Idea, Vodafone, Bharti and the other major carriers there are reaccelerating their spending after gaining increased clarity with respect to spectrum positions and the regulatory environment in that country. 
And finally, in Nigeria, we're already seeing indications of very strong demand, as we convert formerly captive, underutilized Airtel assets into the multitenant commercial real estate leasing model. With the largest population in Africa, very limited fixed line infrastructure, a competitive wireless sector and a massive need for better networks, we believe we can aggressively add tenants to our portfolio of approximately 4,700 sites there. Given our required return hurdles in Nigeria, even with one tenant, these assets have an NOI yield of over 8%. And by adding just one more tenant, we believe we can grow those yields to 17% or more. This illustrates the huge potential we see in this market. 
In closing, our focus has always been and will continue to be to leverage our international operations to extend and prolong our ability to drive compelling, consistent, long-term stockholder returns. We have an extensive track record and a great team putting together great deployment of these assets and delivering really great high organic growth rates and, consequently, higher NOI yields to our investors. Importantly, a significant portion of our current international portfolio is comprised of sites that we have added over just the last few years, which we expect will complement our high-performing U.S. business with even greater growth rates for an extended period of time.

And we think that those plans are going to fully support the mobile operators, the continued deployment of 3G and 4G in the country. One aspect of this is that this emergent middle class that has developed in Brazil over, say, the last 5 years or so, 5 to 10-year time periods, is stabilizing. One of the government's major goals was -- portrayed to us was that they didn't want backsliding from people who've made it in the middle class to backslide into a lower social economic situation. And they feel that they've been fairly successful in that. And so that middle class is really the core customer for the 3G and 4G handset as it gets down to that $100 mark and the ARPU is going from, call it, $8 to $10 or $12. These people can afford that, which is really important. However, the government also recognizes that it's time to sort of get back to business, if you will, and the global economic situation is stable enough for them to do that. And I think with the new finance minister in place and government policies that he and President Rousseff are implementing, you're going to see a comeback by Brazil over the next few years, sort of on a larger scale. So we think it's very supportive. And the last point I'll make about Brazil is, who are these mobile operators? They are global, multinational, very well-capitalized companies with long-term views of their business, and they're stepping up their investment in this market even while it may be sort of a downtick here on some of the in-country metrics."

So you're absolutely right that we don't have anything significant in the guidance that Tom just laid out and probably won't see the significant impacts until 2016 because the updates have to come in. We've got to process them, price them, negotiate with the client, et cetera. That's a few-month process before the notes to proceed with equipment installation comes through and we start building. So 2016, I think, is the prime time to see the full benefits of the increasing competitive nature in the Mexican global market. But what's already clear is the value that AT&T and América Móvil have publicly stated they're putting on ramping up their networks. And I mentioned earlier their public statements are $3 billion and $6 billion, respectively, in investments over the next few years. That's going to be a sizable increase in the CapEx devoted to Mexican mobile networks. And all our aggression analyses in the U.S. and elsewhere say when that happens, we should have positive revenue upside. But until we see those actual plans and have the MLA firmly in place and can model that based on the deployment plan we get from our customer, we won't be able to quantify it quite yet."

And again, I can sort of encapsulate the core elements of public statements our customers have made for you as they apply to our business. So indulge while I just run down the 4 major carriers quickly, and you can let me know if there's a follow-up you'd like. And I'll just start with Verizon. What they're in the midst of doing right now is enhancing their network and the forgoing data load that it's carrying based on their 4G service products by deploying AWS spectrum throughout the country and on many, if not most, and maybe someday, almost all their sites. AWS spectrum is a much higher frequency, of course, than the 700-megahertz spectrum that's the foundation of the Verizon 4G network. And so we're seeing as a consequence of that additional trend by Verizon towards collocating on brand-new towers that they haven't had equipment on in the past with us. That means there's cell splitting going on probably because of, I would imagine, capacity requirements, but also driven in large part by the fact that these sites just need to be closer together because the spectrum's higher and it doesn't travel as far. So I think that's one of the keys there. The next phase for Verizon will be to refarm their 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G. I think that will continue the phenomenon there. Their CapEx spending has been really stable. I do believe Verizon's network planning and operations team, which is excellent and we know well, has the confidence of the corporation to continue to spend at the levels their spending and reinvest in that network, which is pretty high-performing right now. Turning to T-Mobile, they're going the opposite direction in aggressively deploying A block spectrum of the 700-megahertz band, which means additional equipment on a lot of sites there we are transmitting from. So we see relatively more amendments from them as an example because they're going from a network of -- that was designed around higher-frequency spectrum and augmenting that with the 700. And then they'll fill it in, I think, in phases 2 and 3 beyond that over the next few years. But that's much of what they're doing now. The other interesting thing in our space for T-Mobile is their success in gaining customers on their marketing side because they're adding subscribers. Some of those subscribers are then bringing up the usage in places where T-Mobile used the roam on other carriers' networks. And as a result of that increasing revenue opportunity, by being successful in the subscriber marketplace, the business case for T-Mobile is to now start building out their own network assets in places where they used to pay their competitors to carry their traffic. The jargon in our industry for that is a roaming overbuild, and we're seeing that in some areas of the country from T-Mobile, which helps also drive new business with us. And those, of course, tend to be new leases in those cases. Turning to AT&T, we have a holistic agreement with AT&T that's run a few years now designed to give them a steady opportunity to continue to deploy equipment on our sites under that agreement, and they are. The other benefit of that agreement for us is when they're in a grooming period, as they are now, you'll recall that 18 to 12 months ago, AT&T was doing really outside investment in their network. When you have an outside investment, you tend to have, logically, a little bit longer grooming period to get that investment in the network to perfectly see how it performs, and then you go into another reinvestment cycle. We're in the trough of that now, but our holistic agreement keeps their revenues with us pretty steady. One interesting fact that AT&T's disclosed is that their smartphone ARPU is double that of non-smartphone ARPU. And now they're to a point where they're really aggressively transitioning as Verizon is, almost all of their investor base to smartphones and then upgrading those smartphones as well, this rolling sort of compounding network demand is going to continue. But that's just an interesting data point for us that they talk about as mobile operator, which is when if somebody does that conversion, their ARPU doubles. The usage goes up, too, with their ARPU doubles. And that allows them to reinvest to support that customer. And Sprint is still in the -- we expect final planning stages of how they're going to go to their network reinvestment cycle, and we'll be closely working with them on that. But at the moment, again, with the holistic agreement in place, we have a steady and stable revenue trajectory from Sprint over the last few years. That continues, and we're looking forward to see if there's upside to that when the new rollout plan comes out. Amir, does that cover your question?"

And on the discretionary, we see a bit of a mixed trend difference in terms of our build-to-suits. And so the biggest piece of the discretionary or the decline in CapEx is in our development part of the budget. And while we're still going to be building, we expect in the kind of that 3,000 range, we expect more of those sites to be built outside of the United States than inside of the United States. And so as a result, given the cost to build is lower outside of the United States, we are taking down our overall discretionary build."

I'll try to get as much of that done in the times we have left as possible and still get time for someone else to pop in. But let me speak quickly about Verizon. As any other large asset acquisition in our space by any of the peer group, there's an integration period that needs to happen. We get the sites and the site's information and data on sort of day one of the closing. And we get the right to market those sites to others who maybe not have felt they've had access to them in the past. And so there's a ramp-up period to get to, if you will, full leasing speed. It's like accelerating a car from 0 to 60. So what we are seeing is the first sort of 6 months or 3 to 6 months of what we expected to happen during that initial launch of acceleration period is indeed happening. There's a lot of pent-up demand, both -- literally applications that were around Verizon's regions that were sort of in drawers and files to be processed. We've gotten all those and we're -- we hope more speedily implementing those applications than otherwise have been. And then we've already got about another 400, 500 that have come in over -- through our sales force since we've gotten the sites. So for this stage of the 0-to-60 acceleration, we feel we're at where we need to be. In addition to that, our initial SG&A review is showing that we'll probably come in under the SG&A we thought we needed to add at American Tower to manage these sites. So by, again, the end of the first full year of owning and operating the Verizon sites, we see ourselves bringing in the new business and revenue that we thought, at least that much, and we also see us underspending on the cost side as well. We'll finish this integration process and be up to the sort of 60-miles-an-hour speed in the first half of 2016 some time. We have 12,000 sites to do. I've been out for some of the site visits. These are extensive and thorough as they should be. And when we get that site visit done and get all the information and drawings into our system, as I've seen done, we're ready to go and lease that site quickly. And that's our goal. So that's where we are in Verizon, and I would say at or on the trajectory with speeds that we have hoped for at this point. Core organic growth in the international markets, India and Brazil are outperforming, as are some others, but those are the 2 biggest ones with the most impact. And as far as small cells, I'm going to give you the short answer. I've a very extensive one someday for you when we're together, David, based on our entire strategy of the 3 strategic pillars that we've put in place when I got here in sort of 2001. And those are to reach sufficient asset scale to drive performance and whatever asset class we participate in, to then drive superior operational execution to expand margins with those assets and, at the same time, maintain a strong financial position. So those are still our goals. We are an investor in small cells, by the way. We're the largest player, both in U.S. and outside, to my knowledge, in the independent third-party provisioning indoor distributing antenna systems, which we think are the best-performing, fast-growth, most locatable and highest-margin types of small cells that we're aware of so far, and we're evaluating everything else. As the individual transactions, we don't have visibility to the details behind those. I really can't speak to them, but we're an active player in this. We're looking at every asset class. We are going to break those asset classes in those 3 categories and on our expected ability to drive growth and returns. And we're looking at all those asset classes. And at the moment, we're very focused on U.S. macro towers, international macro towers, indoor DAS systems, and there may be more to come based on our ongoing assessment."

So we've had a team evaluating EMEA, and specifically Western Europe, since 2007. And some are conclusions that make it so far -- make the investments there for us a little more challenging, let's say. And those -- some of them are just structural issues. So without going into all the technical details, the towers themselves in most of the markets and in the German sites that we have bought from E-Plus 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years ago are dumped in this category tend to be very short structurally, really only designed for the individual one carrier that put it up. The other issue sometimes and some of these consequences, the governments have mandated network swapping or noncommercial-sharing, which then takes away some of the upside. So we have to put these kinds of structural and regulatory elements into our assessment. Therefore, again, it's a tougher investment case for us in mainly the countries with a lot of the assets. The other side of the equation, because these are short, small, single-use towers, when there is industry consolidation in terms of carriers going from, say, 5 to 4, 4 to 3 in a country in Europe, they're going to want to try to rationalize some of those towers, which makes the hurdle for investment in the towers potentially even higher. So the structural and regulatory issues raised the bar for us, so to speak, in many investment scenarios in Western Europe. However, the one exception we did find so far was the E-Plus sites in Germany. We anticipated the merger of Deutsche Telekom and E-Plus -- I'm sorry, the merger of Telefónica's asset there and E-Plus kind of based that in a business model we certainly knew it was coming. So it doesn't really affect the business case. In that situation, we're able to meet our growth and return on investment combination that we see a little less growth, a little more return on investment upfront, and all the math works for us. So we're going to keep looking for those, but I'm not sure we're going to be sort of the market leader under current conditions in Western Europe, although we're going to keep at it."

There's a differentiation between indoor DAS performance that we've seen and outdoor DAS performance. And so our tenancies on the indoor DAS systems, which we view as much more collocatable for a host of technical reasons, which again we don't have time to get into right now. And that's been born out in the actual feedback on the sites and systems we have up and running. So our tenancy on IDAS is over 2. Just like towers, you expect them if you've been running them for 5 or more years to have over 2 customers for towers, say, in the U.S. And that's our experience with indoor DAS. Outdoor DAS is younger. It isn't there yet, but we're finding the lease upgrade, frankly, to be slower. There's not a 100's overlap between all the carriers on an initial design. And so you don't have 100% of the lease-up opportunity. And the ODAS systems tend to be much more expensive to put. And they're, therefore, more expensive to the carrier from a rental perspective, and it's a harder decision for them. Our gross margins with indoor DAS systems, again, is right up there with towers, 75% in the U.S. and return on invested capital in the same ballpark as towers, 16%. So mid to high double-digit returns. So Indoor DAS plus is meeting our investment criteria, the same sort of investment criteria we have on U.S. macro towers and international macro towers. And that's what we focus. We are seeking to find other type of small cell assets in the asset class that we can have confidence can reach these kinds of metrics. And we're going to continue to search for those. As far as the ultimate opportunity in indoor DAS is probably some of the outdoor opportunity with towers. Can you get the 3 tenants over a period of time? It's a logical thing that you can. So that would be what we would see. Secondly, you said, you asked about a number of sort of additional opportunities to drive leasing. Those are all there. We don't put them again into our guidance until they're actually in place. Applications based on those are coming in. It's hard to speculate on them individually, but they're all constructive for the long-term trajectory of you asked tower demand cycle.

And we're, as Jim said, excited about the growth that we see there. There are other assets there, but I think our first priority is clearly just integrating that business into our portfolio. And as you all know, we have business development teams around the world. We continue to look at asset classes in every market that we're in. India is a significant opportunity. We have significant builds going on in the marketplace. There are a lot of other assets in the market itself, and we have a very disciplined process that will put each one of those assets to see whether it meets our criteria and whether we're able to close on it. But it's clearly our strategy to get deeper and deeper into each and every market that we're in to be the #1 or 2 player in every market that we're at. And as we saw, and even in the second quarter, as a result of the scale that we've been able to have in our international market, we've really been able to increase significantly the operating margins and the leverage in the market. So the model works, and we just need to continue to put these different opportunities through the process that we have. And to the extent that it meets our criteria, we'll hopefully be able to move on it. And we have the balance sheet to be able to do it."

Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda",783,"Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our financial and operational performance for the second quarter as well as our full year outlook for 2015. And then, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss the organic growth and returns being generated by our key international markets and how our diversified portfolio of assets positions us to drive compelling returns for shareholders well into the future. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2015 outlook and future operating performance; our expectations regarding our future growth, industry trends, anticipated contributions of recently closed acquisitions; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and in our other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our second quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 14.8% from the second quarter of 2014 to over $1.15 billion. As we previewed for you during our first quarter earnings call, we expect the domestic revenue growth in the second quarter to be impacted unfavorably by the timing of revenue recognition of our customer decommissioning agreement. This did, in fact, occur, and the $5 million decline in decommissioning revenue recorded in the second quarter versus the prior year period brought down our consolidated organic core growth by approximately 70 basis points and our domestic organic core growth by about 100 basis points. 
During the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew 11.7% to approximately $762 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased 13.3% to approximately $537 million. During the quarter, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by approximately $100 million to about $129 million or $0.31 per basic and $0.30 per diluted common share. The contributing factors to the year-over-year decline in net income were the losses we incurred on the early retirement of certain long-term debt obligations, which we refinanced during the quarter, an increase in our depreciation expense from the addition of about 25,000 new assets we acquired or built over the last year, and the preferred dividends relating to our recently issued mandatory convertible preferred stock. Adjusting for the onetime impact of the loss on retirement of long-term obligations, net income for common and diluted share would have been approximately $0.48 for the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of approximately 4,700 sites from Airtel in Nigeria for approximately $1.09 billion, including VAT. Approximately $736 million of the consideration was paid in July, and we expect that the remainder will be paid to Airtel on or before January 15, 2016. In addition, we've completed all of the necessary steps to file a tax election pursuant to which the GTP REIT for federal and state income tax purposes will no longer operate as a separate REIT. You may recall that we highlighted this as an opportunity when we announced the transaction nearly 2 years ago, and we are pleased to be in a position to complete this important tax-planning process. As a result, we expect to incur approximately $92 million in onetime costs in the second half of the year, which will lead to several long-term financial and operational benefits for American Tower. These benefits include more efficient cash management, increased cash flow potential, allowing us greater flexibility to fund operations and future growth, enhancement of customer relationships through contract simplification and improved business alignment, in addition to eliminating the complication costs and risks associated with managing a subsidiary REIT. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss the results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a solid second quarter, exceeding our earlier expectations for growth in revenue, margins and AFFO across the business. We are progressing well with the integration of the nearly 11,500 Verizon",2300,"Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, we had a solid second quarter, exceeding our earlier expectations for growth in revenue, margins and AFFO across the business. We are progressing well with the integration of the nearly 11,500 Verizon towers we added in the first quarter and are pleased with their performance so far. We acquired about 4,200 sites in Brazil from Telecom Italia at the end of April, and most recently added around 4,700 towers in Nigeria from Airtel on July 1. We expect to acquire the remaining 2,300-or-so sites in Brazil from TIM and up to an additional 200 sites in Nigeria from Airtel over the next 12 months or so. Our strategy of pursuing international investments to strengthen and extend our consolidated growth rate is delivering results, and we are pleased with the benefits we're experiencing due to the scale we have added to our international business. We believe these international investments will continue to help drive returns significantly above those of our U.S. business. 
If you'll please turn to Slide 6. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 15% to approximately $1.2 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was over 23%. And of this core growth, over 7% was organic or about 8% excluding our U.S. decommissioning revenues. The balance of our core growth [indiscernible] was attributable to properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including more than 12,000 in each of our domestic and international segments. 
Turning to Slide 7, our domestic rental and management segment generated core growth in revenue of about 21% during the second quarter with organic core growth in revenue of 5.8% or nearly 7% excluding our U.S. decommissioning revenues. T-Mobile and Verizon led the way in terms of both new leases and amendments in Q2 and continue to comprise the bulk of our new business pipeline. As expected, we saw sequential improvement in signed new business trends during the quarter with signed new business increasing over 50% from Q1. Overall, our U.S. business continues to deliver good performance with organic growth for the year expected to be right around the midpoint of our long-term target range. Our new Verizon sites are also delivering solid results and are performing in line with our expectations. 
Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by about 16% on both a reported and core basis to $621 million and reflected a 61% revenue conversion rate. Excluding the Verizon sites, this conversion rate would have been approximately 90%. We constructed 12 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on nearly 500 ground leases with extensions averaging about 29 years. Including the new Verizon sites, around 62% of the land under our U.S. towers is now either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we are targeting to achieve 80% in the next 5 years. We also enhanced our domestic small cell offering and have nearly 300 domestic indoor DAS systems online. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown this portfolio nearly 11%, adding 32 new systems since the second quarter of last year. We are pleased with the performance of these systems and have been able to obtain average indoor DAS tenancies of about 2.2 with an NOI yield of nearly 16%. DAS, in combination with our managed rooftop business, represents about 6% of our U.S. revenues and had revenue growth of over 25% in the quarter. 
Our U.S. segment, including towers and managed networks, generated reported and core domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 17%. This reflects strong revenue growth, our continuing focus on property-level cost controls and SG&A as a percentage of revenue of around 4%. We're also managing the integration of the Verizon portfolio efficiently and have added less SG&A to-date as compared to the levels we initially contemplated for the transaction. 
Moving on to Slide 8, our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter with core growth of about 28% and organic core growth in revenue of nearly 12%. Reported revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation effects of about $80 million from the prior year period. We saw strong demand for sites across our portfolio with markets such as India, Brazil and Mexico all generating double-digit growth in signed new business over the prior year period. Large investment-grade tenants like Airtel, Vodafone and Telefónica continue to generate the majority of our international revenues and organic new business growth. In Mexico, for example, AT&T has been our top new business customer so far this year. And in Latin America as a whole, AT&T and Telefónica now comprise nearly 50% of our revenues. We also continue to invest in our existing markets through new tower construction and built more than 900 new towers across our international foot [indiscernible] Q2. In India, we built over 600 sites during the quarter for operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. We built over 150 sites in Brazil to support the needs of Vivo and TIM and are continuing to see newbuild activity ramp significantly in that market. We built an additional 61 towers in Ghana and Uganda as well during the quarter with MTN as our anchor tenant. Simultaneously, we're investing in small cells, not only in the U.S. but also in our international markets, where we think the indoor opportunity may even be greater. In fact, in just the last year, we have grown our international indoor DAS asset base more than 50%. We now have over 125 systems installed. Our international indoor DAS portfolio is performing well and is already delivering an NOI yield comparable to that of the U.S. indoor DAS portfolio. We continue to view indoor DAS as a good complement to our core global macro tower business and remain focused on deploying capital to multitenant small-cell solutions in all of our markets where it makes financial sense. 
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 5% to about $222 million, while core growth in gross margin was around 33%. Our reported international rental and management segment's operating profit grew more than 8% to $192 million, and the operating profit margin improved about 340 basis points over the second quarter of last year to nearly 55%. Excluding pass-through revenue, this segment's operating margin grew to 75%, which is up from 70% generated Q2 of last year. Our core growth in international operating profit was 40% for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 11.7% with core growth of over 21%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 65%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was about 71%, and the adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio was about 57%. This was impacted by both the timing of the decommissioning revenue in the U.S. and the addition of the Verizon and TIM Brazil assets to the base. Excluding these impacts, our adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio would have been around 90% due to our legacy site revenue outperformance and solid expense management during the quarter. Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was under 8%. And for the full year, we expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be around 8.5% as we absorb the cost associated with the launch of our newest market in Nigeria. Longer term, we would expect our SG&A as a percentage of revenues to decline as we drive organic growth across the portfolio. Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased over 13% to $537 million or $1.26 per share. Core AFFO growth was over 25%, and our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio during the quarter was just under 80%. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Given the performance of the business, we are raising our full year outlook for rental and management revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our new outlook does not include the 2,300 sites from TIM in Brazil or the 200 towers from Airtel in Nigeria yet to be closed. We now expect 2015 rental and management segment revenue of about $4.67 billion at the midpoint. The increase is driven by about $110 million in additional rental revenue from Airtel Nigeria assets, including about $30 million in pass-through revenue as well as about $10 million of legacy international outperformance. This growth is being partially offset by around $15 million of negative foreign currency translation effects relative to our prior outlook and a reduction of approximately $15 million in U.S. noncash straight-line revenue recognition. For the year, we now expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 23%, which includes organic core growth expectations of about 7% and nearly 10.5% for our domestic and international segments, respectively. On a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 organic core growth in revenue to be around 8%. 
In addition, we're increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $30 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the new assets we've added to our portfolio, complemented by international organic revenue outperformance and solid cost controls globally of about $22 million. This is partially offset by the U.S. straight-line revenue reduction I just mentioned and about $7 million in unfavorable FX translation effects relative to our prior outlook. We now expect core growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 21%. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO outlook at the midpoint by $60 million. This is being driven by about $30 million in incremental cash EBITDA from the Airtel Nigeria assets and around $17 million in incremental cash EBITDA from legacy sites. In addition, we now expect net cash interest expense and cash taxes, collectively, to be $15 million lower than our prior outlook, and this is being partially offset by a few million dollars in negative foreign currency translation effects versus our prior AFFO outlook. Our AFFO growth is expected to be about 17% for the year or about 25% on a core basis. As a result, our AFFO per share growth is forecasted to be over 10% or nearly 18% on a core basis, inclusive of the impact of our financing transactions completed during the year. Consequently, we now expect to reach $5 per share in AFFO at the midpoint. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, which we believe will support our business in generating consistent, robust growth in a variety of business and economic cycles. We are focused on simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've invested nearly $7 billion through our M&A program, declared about $400 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, and deployed over $300 million in CapEx. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and our growing dividends will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in our REIT distribution of at least 20%, which is actually averaged around 30% over the last 12 months. Our payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is currently over 30% and is expected to grow to over 40% within the next few years due to anticipated growth in our taxable income and the reduction of our net operating losses. We also seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and pro forma for the Airtel Nigeria acquisition purchase price at nearly $2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to opportunistically extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of around 5.5 years with an average interest cost of about 3.5%. We took steps toward achieving this in the second quarter by refinancing securitized notes assumed through our acquisition of GTP in 2013 and by issuing senior notes to term out revolver borrowings. Secured debt now composes around 20% of our total debt, and we expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range and anticipate reaching 5x leverage or below by the end of 2016. Longer term, our target leverage range continues to be 3 and 5 -- between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This solid financial platform will continue to give us the flexibility to invest in the most compelling global, multitenant commercial real estate opportunities well into the future. 
Turning to Slide 13. And in summary, we started 2015 with a solid first half and believe we are well positioned to leverage our global asset base to drive strong growth throughout the rest of 2015. We are again raising our 2015 outlook for rental and management revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and similar to last year, expect core growth in all 3 metrics to be above our long-term targets, all over 20%. By year-end, we anticipate having nearly 100,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and manageable leverage in the mid-5x range. Trends across our global footprint, particularly in our international markets, continue to be favorable. Mobile voice and data usage is increasing rapidly. Advanced handsets are becoming more affordable for more and more people. And carriers are monetizing incremental usage and generating solid returns. Our disciplined capital allocation process has positioned us to benefit from these trends on a global basis, and we expect to utilize our industry-leading portfolio and financial position to drive compelling returns for our stockholders for many years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As demonstrated by the second quarter results and updated outlook, both our domestic and international segments continue to perform well. This performance is a result of the combination of accelerating data demand",1979,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As demonstrated by the second quarter results and updated outlook, both our domestic and international segments continue to perform well. This performance is a result of the combination of accelerating data demand across our markets and the scale, diversification and quality of our global tower and small-cell distributed antenna system portfolios. 
As Tom mentioned, we augmented our U.S. operations significantly with the addition of the Verizon tower assets earlier this year. I've participated in some of the initial site inspections myself and have been in close touch with our U.S. team. And the team has the integration of the Verizon portfolio solidly on track, and the new business pipeline on the towers is shaping up nicely. Consequently, our experience to-date with the Verizon towers is confirming our valuation assumptions on the attractiveness of those sites' locations, pent-up demand for both collocation and amendment activity, and the quality of those assets. We expect that the addition of the Verizon portfolio will further strengthen our domestic growth profile and operational performance for many years to come. 
Consistent with my prepared remarks in past years second quarter call, my focus this morning will be on our international segment, where we're seeing outperformance relative to our initial projections for the year. After a very brief recap of our international investment philosophy, I'll discuss the key current and future trends in our largest international markets and then review our extensive track record of generating outsized growth and return on investment internationally while discussing our confidence in being able to replicate this performance on our newly acquired assets as well. 
This has been a long journey. Over the last 15 years, we've carefully selected a series of markets interconnected through a strong core of common multinational customers, solid underpinning of rule of law and property rights, and long-term wireless industry growth potential. For markets where 4G is being deployed, like the U.S. and Germany, some markets where additional voice networks are still being built out such as India, we're positioned to benefit from carrier investments in both the short and the long term. In developing and emerging markets, this growth will be supported by several key factors. First, wireless carriers in these markets continue to generate healthy margins and return on investment despite ARPUs, or average revenue per user per month, that appear to be low on the surface. For example, in India, where per-SIM ARPU is around $3, average wireless carrier EBITDA margins are still over 30%. This is attributable to the typical customer behavior in that country where individuals utilize multiple SIM cards to power their devices, often from different wireless carriers. Moreover, leading mobile operators in markets such as India also take full advantage of low-cost inputs, such as labor, and modest, if any, handset subsidies. Similarly, in Brazil, where the ARPU is around $8, mobile operator EBITDA margins are also above 30%. This is especially notable given that in the U.S., where ARPUs are in the $50 range, carrier EBITDA margins are similar to these much-lower ARPU markets. As a result, we continue to believe that the mobile network operators across our served markets have the financial capacity to make meaningful investments in the network and resulting in incremental equipment on our towers and ongoing revenue growth opportunities for us. Simultaneously, the middle class in these markets, along with its buying power, is growing substantially, while importantly, smartphone prices, as Tom said, are coming down. There are now a number of smartphones available internationally in the $100 range, which has about 70% to 80% of the functionality of a device that would sell for $700 or $800 in the United States. With increasing incomes, more and more people are now able to afford one of these advanced devices while also being able to pay more for data plans. As historical analyses have shown, getting more advanced devices in the hands of consumers leads to more usage on wireless networks. In turn, as the carriers benefit from increasing ARPUs from those smartphone users, they're able to redeploy that cash into investments to further support network quality. 
India's a prime example of a market where we believe there will be a very long runway of wireless network investment accompanied by strong organic growth for our 14,000-site portfolio there. With smartphone penetration at just 10%, a population of over 1.2 billion people and minimal access to wireline, cable, fiber or satellite-based alternatives, mobile is poised to be the primary method of communication and entertainment for the future. Today, 85% to 90% of Indian mobile phone users are still on 2G, and there remains a significant portion of the rural population with no access at all. We're working with public and private sector partners in India to develop innovative concepts like the digital town square with the tower as the centerpiece. The digital town square concept brings together electrical power, Internet connectivity, site security, educational kiosk connected to the Internet and mobile service by our customers to support the Indian government's digital India plan. We believe this can not only accelerate bringing mobile voice and Internet service to underserved rural populations, but it'll also provide us at American Tower with some great opportunities for incremental tower build investments, which have historically generated our highest return on invested capital. 
Brazil is another market where we expect to generate very strong growth in both the short and long term. Clustered around key population centers like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are more than 16,000 Brazilian sites -- provide our tenants with the real estate they need to respond to rapidly growing usage across their networks. With over 4,000 SIM cards per cell site, or about double that of the United States, Brazilian networks are extremely congested and increasing mobile data usage is compounding the issue. If smartphone prices continue to drop, penetration climbs. And today, it stands over 35% as compared to under 10% of smartphone penetration just 5 years ago in Brazil. Furthermore, industry projections call for mobile data usage to grow proximately eightfold in Brazil over the next 5 years, prompting the leading mobile operators in that country to recommit significant network investment. These include the local Telefónica unit, Vivo; and Telecom Italia Mobile, or TIM, from whom we recently acquired about 4,200 sites in April. 
The story is similar throughout the other markets within our international footprint. In Mexico, AT&T's recently announced $3 billion investment and América Móvil's recently announced $6 billion investment should both be excellent opportunities for us given our portfolio position there. In South Africa, Vodafone, Telkom and Cell C are all actively rolling out and augmenting their 3G networks as the population continues to increasingly consume mobile data in that country. And in markets like Nigeria and Ghana, both 2G and 3G rollouts are happening concurrently. 
To be in a position to benefit from these types of trends, we have built a diversified international business with a long track record of generating compelling returns. It's important to hear [indiscernible] numbers, some real facts, so let's run through a few specific examples. I'll start in Brazil, where over the last 3 years organic core revenue growth has averaged more than 12% or 400 basis points or so higher than the U.S. equivalent. Since our entry into the market in the year 2000, we have focused on building and acquiring high-quality towers in prime locations. This is evidenced by our ability to drive leasing activity. On Brazilian sites that we've constructed or acquired between the year 2000 and 2005, for example, we have averaged nearly 3 tenants and a local currency NOI yield approaching 50% or well over 30% on a dollar basis, taking into account changes in foreign currency. For the 2005 to 2010 vintage in Brazil, we have nearly 2 tenants per tower and an average local currency NOI yield of almost 30% and a U.S. dollar yield of more than 20%. So as you can see, with the performance of our longest-tenure vintages, the more time that we independently own and operate a tower asset, the higher the tenancy and return profile of that asset tends to become. This is repeatable in all the markets. In Mexico, our international market was the longest tenure. We have generated organic core growth rates averaging nearly 10% over the last 3 years. Going back to the 2000 to 2005 vintage in Mexico, for example, it generates NOI yields of more than 30% on both a local currency and a U.S. dollar basis with average tenancy of over 2.0. For assets in Mexico added to the portfolio between 2005 and 2010, we're also generating approximately 30% NOI yields with over 2 tenants per tower on average. We now anticipate significant incremental new business in Mexico from AT&T, América Móvil and other mobile operators as the competitive environment in that market becomes increasingly dynamic and 4G is aggressively introduced. If it is estimated that for a robust, near-nationwide 4G network to cover Mexico's population, at least twice as many cell sites than currently exist will be required there. 
Turning to South Africa, where we started doing business only in 2011, organic core revenue growth rates for us there have averaged almost 15%, while our consolidated, local currency NOI yields sit at nearly 26%; for the U.S. dollar equivalent, at about 19% there. Carriers have aggressively spent capital to improve and extend their networks, and a significant portion of those investments has resulted in incremental equipment being placed on our South African real estate. 
In India, we've experienced average organic core revenue growth of over 10% in the past year, including nearly 14% in the second quarter. On a 3-year basis, the average has been around 9%. We've been able to generate solid returns on our assets in India since entering the market. For the 2005 to 2010 vintage in India, for example, local currency NOI yields are about 12% with a U.S. dollar equivalent at more than 10% and average tenancy above 2.0 per tower. And for sites we've added since 2010, which have all been build-to-suits, the yields are actually even higher at around 20% with an average tenancy of 1.7 or so. Currently in India, Idea, Vodafone, Bharti and the other major carriers there are reaccelerating their spending after gaining increased clarity with respect to spectrum positions and the regulatory environment in that country. 
And finally in Nigeria, we're already seeing indications of very strong demand as we convert formerly captive, underutilized Airtel assets into the multitenant commercial real estate leasing model. With the largest population in Africa, very limited fixed line infrastructure, a competitive wireless sector and a massive need for better networks, we believe we can aggressively add tenants to our portfolio of approximately 40 -- 4,700 sites there. Given our acquired return hurdles in Nigeria, even with 1 tenant, these assets have an NOI yield of over 8%. And by adding just 1 more tenant, we believe we can grow those yields to 17% or more. This illustrates the huge potential we see in this market. 
In closing, our focus has always been and will continue to be to leverage our international operations to extend and prolong our ability to drive compelling, consistent, long-term stockholder returns. We have an extensive track record and a great team putting together great deployment of these assets and delivering really great high organic growth rates and, consequently, higher NOI yields to our investors. Importantly, a significant portion of our current international portfolio is comprised of sites that we have added over just the last few years, which we expect will complement our high-performing U.S. business with even greater growth rates for an extended period of time. 
Tom and I will now be happy to take your questions. So operator, can you open up the line, please?"

And we think that those plans are going to fully support the mobile operators, the continued deployment of 3 and 4G in the country. One aspect of this is that this emergent middle class that has developed in Brazil over, say, the last 5 years or so, 5- to 10-year time period, it's stabilizing. One of the government's major goals was -- portrayed to us was that they didn't want backsliding from people who've made it in the middle class to backslide into a lower socioeconomic situation. And they feel that they've been fairly successful in that. And so that middle class is really the core customer for the 3 and 4G handset as it gets down to that $100 mark and the ARPUs go from, call it, $8 to $10 or $12. These people can afford that, which is really important. However, the government also recognizes that it's time to sort of get back to business, if you will, and the global economic situation is stable enough for them to do that. And I think with the new finance minister in place and government policies that he and President Rousseff are implementing, you're going to see a comeback by Brazil over the next few years, sort of on a larger scale. So we think it's very supportive. And the last point I'll make about Brazil is, who are these mobile operators? They are global, multinational, very well-capitalized companies with long-term views of their business, and they're stepping up their investment in this market even while it may be sort of a downtick here on some of the in-country metrics."

One is we don't put anything in the guidance until we see applications in the office in Mexico City or in Woburn, Mass., or wherever the operations team is accepting those around the world. So you're absolutely right that we don't have anything significant in the guidance that Tom just laid out and probably won't see the significant impacts until 2016 because the updates would have to come in. We've got to process them, price them, negotiate with the client, et cetera. That's a few-month process before the notice to proceed with equipment installation comes through and we start building. So 2016, I think, is the prime time to see the full benefits of the increasing competitive nature in the Mexican global market. But what's already clear is the value that AT&T and América Móvil have publicly stated they're putting on ramping up their networks. And I mentioned earlier their public statements are $3 billion and $6 billion, respectively, in investments over the next few years. That's going to be a sizable increase in the CapEx devoted to Mexican mobile networks. And all of our progressive analyses in the U.S. and elsewhere say when that happens, we should have positive revenue upside. But until we see those actual plans and have the MLA firmly in place and can model that based on the deployment plan we get from our customer, we won't be able to quantify it quite yet."

And again, I can sort of encapsulate the core elements of public statements our customers have made for you as they apply to our business.

And again, I can sort of encapsulate the core elements of public statements our customers have made for you as they apply to our business. So indulge me while I just run down the 4 major carriers quickly, and you can let me know if there's a follow-up you'd like. And I'll just start with Verizon. What they're in the midst of doing right now is enhancing their network and the forgoing data load that it's carrying based on their 4G service products by deploying AWS spectrum throughout the country and on many, if not most, and maybe someday, almost all their sites. AWS spectrum is a much higher frequency, of course, than the 700-megahertz spectrum that's the foundation of the Verizon 4G network. And so we're seeing as a consequence of that additional trend by Verizon towards collocating on brand-new towers that they haven't had equipment on in the past with us. That means there's cell splitting going on partly because of, I would imagine, capacity requirements but also driven in large part by the fact that these sites just need to be closer together because the spectrum's higher and it doesn't travel as far. So I think that's one of the keys there. The next phase for Verizon will be to refarm their 1900 PCS spectrum from 3 to 4G. I think that will continue the phenomenon there. Their CapEx spending has been really stable. I do believe Verizon's network planning and operations team, which is excellent and we know well, has the confidence of the corporation to continue to spend at the levels their spending and reinvest in that network, which is pretty high-performing right now. Turning to T-Mobile, they're going the opposite direction in aggressively deploying A-Block spectrum of the 700-megahertz band, which means additional equipment on a lot of sites there we are [ph] transmitting from. So we see relatively more amendments from them as an example because they're going from a network of -- that was designed around higher-frequency spectrum and augmenting that with the 700. And then they'll fill it in, I think, in phases 2 and 3 beyond that over the next few years. But that's much of what they're doing now. The other interesting thing in our space for T-Mobile is their success in gaining customers on their marketing side because they're adding subscribers. Some of those subscribers are then bringing up the usage in places where T-Mobile used to roam on other carriers' networks. And as a result of that increasing revenue opportunity by being successful in the subscriber marketplace, the business case for T-Mobile is to now start building out their own network assets in places where they used to pay their competitors to carry their traffic. The jargon in our industry for that is a roaming overbuild, and we're seeing that in some areas of the country from T-Mobile, which helps also drive new business with us. And those, of course, tend to be new leases in those cases. Turning to AT&T, we have a holistic agreement with AT&T that's run a few years now designed to give them a steady opportunity to continue to deploy equipment on our sites under that agreement, and they are. The other benefit of that agreement for us is when they're in a grooming period, as they are now, you'll recall that 18 to 12 months ago, AT&T was doing really outsized investment in their network. When you have an outsized investment, you tend to have, logically, a little bit longer grooming period to get that investment in the network tuned perfectly, see how it performs, and then you go into another reinvestment cycle. We're in the trough of that now, but our holistic agreement keeps their revenues with us pretty steady. One interesting fact that AT&T's disclosed is their smartphone ARPU is double that of non-smartphone ARPU. And now they're to a point where they're really aggressively transitioning, as Verizon is, almost all of their investor base to smartphones and then upgrading those smartphones as well. This rolling sort of compounding network demand is going to continue. But that's just an interesting data point for us that they talked about as a mobile operator, which is when somebody does that conversion, their ARPU doubles. The usage goes up, too, but their ARPU doubles. And that allows them to reinvest to support that customer. And Sprint is still in the -- we expect final planning stages of how they're going to go to their network reinvestment cycle, and we'll be closely working with them on that. But at the moment, again, with the holistic agreement in place, we have a steady and stable revenue trajectory from Sprint over the last few years. That continues, and we're looking forward to see if there's upside to that when the new rollout plan comes out. Amir, does that cover your question?"

And on the discretionary, we see a bit of a mixed trend difference in terms of our build-to-suits. And so the biggest piece of the discretionary or the decline in CapEx is in our developments part of the budget. And while we're still going to be building, we expect in the kind of that 3,000 range, we expect more of those sites to be built outside of the United States than inside of the United States. And so as a result, given the cost to build is lower outside of the United States, we are taking down our overall discretionary build."

I'll try to get as much of that done in the time as we have left as possible and still give time for someone else to pop in. But let me speak quickly about Verizon. As any other large asset acquisition in our space by any of the peer group, there's an integration period that needs to happen. We get the sites and the site's information and data on sort of Day 1 of the closing. And we get the right to market those sites to others who maybe not have felt they've had access to them in the past. And so there's a ramp-up period to get to, if you will, full leasing speed. It's like accelerating a car from 0 to 60. So what we are seeing is the first sort of 6 months or 3 to 6 months of what we expected to happen during that initial launch and acceleration period is indeed happening. There's a lot of pent-up demand, both -- literally applications that were around Verizon's regions that were sort of in drawers and files to be processed. We've gotten all those, and we're -- we hope more speedily implementing those applications than otherwise have been. And then we've already got about another 400, 500 that have come in over -- through our sales force since we've gotten the sites. So for this stage of the 0-to-60 acceleration, we feel we're at or ahead of where we need to be. In addition to that, our initial SG&A review is showing that we'll probably come in under the SG&A we thought we needed to add at American Tower to manage these sites. So by, again, the end of the first full year of owning and operating the Verizon sites, we see ourselves bringing in the new business and revenue that we thought, at least that much, and we also see us underspending on the cost side as well. We'll finish this integration process and be up to the sort of 60 miles an hour speed in the first half of 2016 sometime. We've got 12,000 sites to do. I've been out for some of the site visits. These are extensive and thorough as they should be. And when we get that site visit done and get all the information and drawings into our system, as I've seen done, we're ready to go and lease that site quickly. And that's our goal. So that's where we are at Verizon, and I would say at or on the trajectory with speeds that we had hoped for at this point. Core organic growth in the international markets, India and Brazil are outperforming, as are some others, but those are the 2 biggest ones with the most impact. And as far as small cells, I'm going to give you the short answer. I've a very extensive one someday for you when we're together, David, based on our entire strategy of the 3 strategic pillars that we've put in place when I got here in sort of 2001. And those are to reach sufficient asset scale to drive performance and whatever asset class we participate in, to then drive superior operational execution to expand margins with those assets and, at the same time, maintain a strong financial position. So those are still our goals. We are an investor in small cells, by the way. We're the largest player, both in U.S. and outside, to my knowledge, in the independent third-party provisioning indoor distributing antenna systems, which we think are the best-performing, fast-growth, most-locatable and highest-margin types of small cells that we're aware of so far, and we're evaluating everything else. As the individual transactions, we don't have visibility to the details behind those. I really can't speak to them, but we're an active player in this. We're looking at every asset class. We are going to rate those asset classes in those 3 categories and on our expected ability to drive growth and returns. And we're looking at all those asset classes. And at the moment, we're very focused on U.S. macro towers, international macro towers, indoor DAS systems, and there may be more to come based on our ongoing assessment."

And even the first quarter, it was about 5% and went up to about 7%. So we saw an uptick in that market as well. So we're seeing it globally. And with regards to your second question on driving the straight line, we reviewed contracts associated with some recent contract extensions that we've done at the end of last year and determined that there were certain leases that were not straight-line-able and maybe adjudgment to our expectations for noncash straight-line revenues. We do that regularly and review the methodology and discover that we just needed to make the adjustment for the year."

And some are inconclusions make it so far -- make the investments there for us a little more challenging, let's say. And those -- some of those are structural issues. So without going into all the technical details, the towers themselves in most of the markets and the German sites that we have bought from E-Plus a year, 1.5 years, 2 years ago are dumped in this category, tend to be very short structurally, really only designed for the individual -- 1 carrier that put it up. The other issues sometimes in some of these consequences the governments have mandated network swapping or noncommercial-sharing, which then takes away some of the upside. So we have to put these kinds of structural and regulatory elements into our assessment. Therefore, again, it's a tougher investment case for us in mainly the countries with a lot of the assets. The other side of the coin is because these are short, small single-use towers, when there is industry consolidation in terms of carriers going from, say, 5 to 4, 4 to 3 in a country in Europe, they're going to want to try to rationalize some of those towers, which makes the hurdle for investment in the towers potentially even higher. So the structural and regulatory issues raised the bar for us, so to speak, in many investment scenarios in Western Europe. However, the one exception we did find so far was the E-Plus sites in Germany. We anticipated the merger of Deutsche Telekom and E-Plus -- I'm sorry, the merger of Telefónica's asset there and E-Plus. Kind of based that in a business model. We certainly knew it was coming, so it doesn't really affect the business case. In that situation, we're able to meet our growth and return on investment combination that we see a little less growth, a little more return on investment upfront, and all the math works for us. So we're going to keep looking for those, but I'm not sure we're going to be sort of the market leader under current conditions in Western Europe, although we're going to keep at it."

There's a differentiation between indoor DAS performance that we've seen and outdoor DAS performance. And so our tenancies on the indoor DAS systems, which we view as much more collocatable for a host of technical reasons, which again we don't have time to get into right now. And that's been born out in the actual feedback on the sites and systems we have up and running. So our tenancy on IDAS is over 2. Just like towers, you expect them if you've been running them for 5 or more years to have over 2 customers for towers, say, in the U.S. And that's our experience with indoor DAS. Outdoor DAS is younger. It isn't there yet, but we're finding the lease upgrade, frankly, to be slower. There's not 100% overlap between all the carriers on an initial design. And so you don't have 100% of the lease-up opportunity. And the ODAS systems tend to be much more expensive to put. And they're, therefore, more expensive to the carrier from a rental perspective, and it's a harder decision for them. Our gross margins with indoor DAS systems, again, right up there with towers, 75% in the U.S. and return on invested capital in the same ballpark as towers, 16%. So mid- to high double-digit returns. So indoor DAS plus is meeting our investment criteria, the same sort of investment criteria we have on U.S. macro towers and international macro towers. And that's what we focus. We are seeking to find other types of small-cell assets in the asset class that we can have confidence can reach these kinds of metrics. And we're going to continue to search for those. As far as the ultimate opportunity in indoor DAS is probably some of the ultimate opportunity with towers. Can you get the 3 tenants over a period of time? It's a logical thing that you can. So that would be what we would see. Secondly, you said, you asked about a number of sort of additional opportunities to drive leasing. Those are all there. We don't put them again into our guidance until they're actually in place. Applications based on those are coming in. It's hard to speculate on them individually, but they're all constructive for the long-term trajectory of U.S. tower demand, frankly. Tom, did you want to add anything?"

So all the drivers in our business tend to not be for 1 half or 1 quarter to come and go or -- but they tend to be over many years.

And then Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss recent technology trends, how they will impact the mobile value chain and how our diversified portfolio of assets positions us to drive compelling returns for shareholders well into the future. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding: our 2015 outlook, foreign currency exchange rate and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our future growth; technology industry trends, anticipated closings of acquisitions, anticipated contributions of pending acquisitions, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in yesterday's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and in our other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligations to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our third quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 20% from the third quarter of 2014 to over $1.21 billion. During the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to approximately $779 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased by more than 21% to approximately $558 million. During the quarter, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by approximately $124 million to about $76 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted common share. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decline in net income were the onetime $93 million cash tax charge as part of our previously announced GTP REIT tax election and approximately $78 million related to unrealized foreign currency losses attributable to our intercompany balances. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire a 51% controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. Please note that given the regulatory process associated with the transaction, we will not be in a position to provide detail on our future expectations regarding the acquisition until that process has concluded.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

As you can see, we had a solid third quarter from both an organic and inorganic growth perspective. In addition, we continue to add assets in select key markets where we believe the opportunity for long-term sustainable growth is compelling. This includes the acquisition of the nearly 4,700 towers in Nigeria we closed in July and the follow-on close of an additional 1,100 sites in Brazil from 10 at the end of September. And as Leah said, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire 51% controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. This transaction will expand our tower footprint there to over 57,000 sites while materially enhancing our ability to help all of the country's major carriers as they deploy 3G and 4G nationwide. As we said previously, we believe India is 5 to 10 years behind the U.S. in terms of wireless technology deployments. And given just a 4% fixed-line penetration and a population of over 1 billion people, predominantly using 2G technology, India is a very attractive market for a tower operator like ourselves. In addition, this transaction is also expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and will help us continue to achieve our aspirational goal of annual double-digit AFFO per share growth over the long term.
If you'll please turn to Slide 6, let's now talk about our quarterly results. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by 20% to just over $1.2 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was more than 27%. And of this core growth, over 7% was organic. The balance of our core growth were approximately 20% was attributable to properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including over 12,000 sites domestically and about 20,000 sites in our international markets, with over 5,000 of the total sites that we built ourselves. The Verizon Airtel Nigeria and Tim Brazil portfolios comprised the bulk of the inorganic core growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management segment generated core growth and revenue of about 21% during the third quarter, with organic core growth and revenue of about 6%. On a year-to-date basis, our domestic organic core revenue growth was about 7%. Our annual organic core growth rate continues to benefit from the elevated decommissioning revenues we've recognized in 2015. As we've previously discussed, decommissioning revenues are expected to be around $38 million for 2015, which is higher than the $21 million we received in 2014. And year-to-date, at the end of the third quarter, we received about $29 million in decommissioning revenues as compared to about $18 million to the same period in 2014. T-Mobile and Verizon drove the majority of our commenced new business in Q3 and continue to comprise the bulk of our new business pipeline. In addition to solid commencement activity, we saw a slight sequential improvement in signed new business during the quarter. Overall, our U.S. business continues to deliver good performance, with organic growth for the year expected to be right in the middle of our long-term target range. In addition, our new Verizon sites are performing in line with our expectations and the integration process is progressing on schedule.
Our domestic rental and management gross margin increased by about 17% on both a reported and core basis to $621 million and reflected a 63% revenue conversion rate. Excluding the Verizon sites, this conversion rate would have been over 90%. In other words, $0.90 of every incremental dollar of organic revenue is falling to the gross margin line.
We also continue to invest in our domestic business. And during the quarter, we constructed 22 towers and added 2 new data systems. While our VAS business continues to comprise a small portion of our domestic revenues, it is growing quickly. On a year-to-date basis, for example, revenue from VAS systems grew over 30% over the prior year period, excluding the impact of any amortization revenue derived from capital contributions.
In addition to investing in new construction in the U.S., we had a record quarter of land management activity, purchasing about 250 parcels and extending ground leases on about 630 of our sites, with the extensions averaging 31 years. Around 62% of the land under our U.S. towers is now either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we would expect to get that number up to 80% in the next 5 years.
Reported in core domestic rental and management operating profit growth was about 18%. This reflects strong revenue growth, our continuing focus on property level cost controls and SG&A as a percentage of revenue of under 4%.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter, with reported growth of about 17% and core growth of about 44%. Organic core growth in revenue was nearly 11%. All of our international regions continue to deliver strong, organic core growth. We are particularly encouraged by the continuing strong trends in Africa, where organic core growth was once again over 20% in markets like Ghana and Uganda. Reported international revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation effects of about $100 million as compared to the prior year period.
We saw strong demand in the quarter with markets such as Mexico, Peru and South Africa all generating double-digit sequential growth and signed new business. Large investment-grade tenants like AT&T, Vodafone and Telefonica a continue to comprise the majority of our international revenues and organic new business growth. Additionally, although our operating history in Nigeria has only been a few months, performance relative to new business commencements in the market is already exceeding expectations. We also further solidified our international revenue growth visibility by signing a long-term master lease agreement with AT&T in Mexico.
In addition, we continue to invest in our existing markets through new tower construction and built over 730 new towers across our international footprint. We added nearly 400 towers for tenants like Bartee and Vodafone in India and had an exceptionally strong quarter of new build activity in Brazil, with over 230 new sites constructed, primarily for vivo and PAM. We also added 9 international DAS systems in the quarter, bringing our international DAS system count to 137 systems. International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 13% to about $240 million. Our reported international operating profit grew nearly 15% to $205 million, and the operating profit margin percentage was about 51%.
Excluding pass-through revenue, our international operating margin expanded over 120 basis points to 72% as compared to the prior year period. Our core growth in international operating profit was 48%.
Turning to Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 17%, with core growth of about 26% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 63%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was about 70%. We've been able to maintain this rate while adding roughly 30,000 towers with an average tenancy of 1.3 tenants per tower over the last year. Our adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio was approximately 65%, [ph] excluding pass-through, or around 90%, if you exclude the impacts of adding the new lower-tenancy Verizon Brazil and Airtel Nigeria assets to the base.
Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was under 8%. And for the full year, we expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be just over 8% versus the 9% and 10% rates of 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Longer term, we expect this annual percentage to continue to decline further as we leverage our existing SG&A base while driving organic growth.
Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased over 21% to $558 million or $1.31 per share. Core AFFO growth was nearly 33% and our adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio during the quarter was just under 87%.
Moving on to Slide 10. We are revising our 2015 rental and management segment revenue outlook to $4.65 billion at the midpoint, which reflects additional foreign currency translation effects of about $56 million [ph] relative to our prior outlook due to the strengthening dollar, which will be largely offset by organic outperformance of our legacy international assets of around $5 million, additional straight line revenue of about $16 million, principally due to our newly executed master lease agreement in Mexico with AT&T, additional pass-through revenue of about $10 million versus our prior outlook and about $5 million in additional revenue from the 1,125 TIM Brazil sites we closed on September 30.
For the year, we expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 23%. This includes organic core growth expectations of about 7% and nearly 11% for our domestic and international segments, respectively, resulting in a consolidated and annual organic core growth rate of 8%.
Moving forward, we expect our international markets to benefit from rising escalators attributable to higher inflation measures in local markets, which should help support international organic core growth and provide some additional insulation from foreign exchange translation effects.
Despite slightly lowered revenue expectations due to the strengthening dollar, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook midpoint by $5 million to $3.05 billion. This reflects both the strong revenue growth of our core business and ongoing cost management, which are more than offsetting the increased unfavorable FX impact to adjusted EBITDA of about $30 million relative to our prior outlook. We now expect core growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 22%, which is about 90 basis points higher than our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We're also raising our full year AFFO outlook by $10 million to $2.13 billion at the midpoint. This is being driven by around $23 million in incremental cash EBITDA from our sites, about $9 million in reduced maintenance and corporate CapEx and $5 million in reduced cash interest. This is being partially offset by an incremental $27 million in negative foreign currency translation effects versus our prior AFFO outlook. Our AFFO growth is now expected to be over 17% for the year or about 27% on a core basis. We expect our AFFO per share growth at the midpoint to be nearly 11% or almost 20% on a core basis. Consequently, we now expect to generate over $5 per share of AFFO for the full year.
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, which we believe will support our business in generating consistently strong growth across a variety of business and economic cycles. We are focused on simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. So far this year, we've committed nearly $9 billion to our M&A program, including our pending Viom transaction; declared about $620 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends; and deployed over $500 million in CapEx. About 40% of our annual CapEx spend is for the construction of an expected 3,000 new build-to-suit sites based on the midpoint of our outlook. Year-to-date, we've completed the construction of over 2,300 sites and have generated a first-year return on investment of over 9% of the sites in a consolidated basis. We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and our REIT distribution will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in the REIT distribution of at least 20%, which has actually been 30% or so over the last 12 months. Our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO is currently about 35% and is expected to grow to between 40% and 50% within the next few years due to anticipated growth in our taxable income and the reduction of our net operating loss carryforwards. We also seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and had about $2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolver since the end of the quarter. From a capital markets perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to opportunistically extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of nearly 6 years, with an average interest cost of about 3.4%. We took steps towards obtaining these goals just this week as we extended the maturity dates of our credit facilities and term loan. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range. Additionally, we expect to be at 5x or below by the end of 2016, including the impact of our recently announced Viom transaction. We expect to evaluate a variety of financing options for this transaction and other funding needs in keeping with our commitment to investment grade while maximizing the value for our equityholders. Our long-term target leverage range continues to be between 3x and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And over the long term, we intend to utilize our solid financial platform to continue to invest in global, multitenant commercial real estate assets where it makes financial sense to do so; and if those opportunities aren't available, return that generated cash back to our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. Our global business has generated core growth above our long-term target for all key metrics so far this year. And we believe we are well positioned to finish the year strong. Our high-quality asset base, strong balance sheet and manageable leverage positions us well to continue to invest in future growth with our recently announced Viom transaction as a prime example. This transaction will significantly increase our presence in a key global market, increase our portfolio's exposure to India's densely populated areas and enhance our role in the government's digital India initiative. This is an exciting time to further increase our presence in India as the market appears to be at a significant inflection point in terms of wireless network investment. And we are excited to help our customers further enhance their wireless networks in the market. Trends across the rest of the markets and our diversified global footprint continue to be favorable as well, with consumer demand for our mobile data increasing at a tremendous pace. Including the impact of Viom, we now have a strong presence in the fourth largest, most strategic markets across the continents we serve.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As we do every year on our third quarter calls, our focus today's remarks on the fundamental trends in wireless usage and technology, which we believe will continue to drive network investment and long-term growth for American Tower.
So let's begin with U.S. mobile data usage, trends and projections as illustrated on Slide 15. The monthly mobile data usage per subscriber on smartphones, laptops and especially tablets, is projected to increase significantly as people seek to mobilize more and more aspects of their daily routine. We believe this growth in mobile data traffic is principally a result of a virtuous cycle. First, after years of significant investment, mobile networks today are more capable than ever at delivering the necessary speeds to support high bandwidth data and entertainment applications. Second, mobile device, processor, battery, software and screen improvements are facilitating increased mobile app navigation, music and video consumption. For example, leading-edge new LTE devices like the iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S6, continues to expand the scope of what we can do on a mobile handset. And whether it's a simple phone call, listening to your favorite music streaming service or getting turn-by-turn directions while driving in your car, a strong, continuous mobile phone signal is becoming ever more essential. As a result, current projections are for the average U.S. smartphone to consume more than 7.5 gigabytes per month in mobile data by 2019, up from around just 2 gigabytes today.
An even greater increase in average uses is projected for network-connected tablets, which are expected to consume nearly double the amount of an average smartphone by 2019. Whether it's streaming an NFL game on 4G at the airport or entertaining your kids with an iPad on a long road trip, mobile video connectivity is becoming more mainstream. This transformation is being fueled by the wire-to-mobile conversion of social media and branded video content, especially by over-the-top providers such as Netflix.
The cumulative impact of these usage trends is shown on Slide 16. After nearly quadrupling in the last 3 years, total U.S. mobile data usage is expected to more than quadruple again by 2019. Since the early part of 2000s, carriers have invested nearly $350 billion in wireless CapEx, as illustrated by the gray shading on Slide 17. They're using this cash to build out their nationwide mobile networks to support the fixed-to-mobile conversion of first telephony, then Internet services, and most recently, social media and entertainment. Each new generation of technology has in turn resulted in explosive growth of traffic on those enhanced networks and then a subsequent step function increase in network investment levels completing the virtuous cycle.
There are 2 facets of mobile network investment, which are depicted in the next slide. The first is known as the core side of the network, the fixed-line portion of the system, which consists of the switches, servers and related electronics, the fiberoptic cable and copper that connects all these major components together and the software that makes it all work. The other side of the network is known as the RAN, or radio access network, and is made up of the widely distributed transmission or cell sites. Each cell then utilizes an airlink over radio spectrum to reach your device over the year. At American Tower, we play only on the RAN side of the network, and demand for our real estate goes up directly whenever more transmission equipment, such as antennas, is required for capacity or when new cell locations are needed for coverage. Moreover, our demand goes up indirectly when improvements in the core network reduced its cost of operation, potentially freeing up more capital and/or optics resources for the RAN and its many cell site. Therefore, it's crucial that new technology and industry developments as they relate to American Tower by asking 3 simple questions about each. First, does this particular technology significantly improve airlink capacity, and thus reduce the need for equipment on towers? Second, does this technology significantly increase the distance of high-quality wireless signal can travel, allowing sites to be positioned further apart? And third, conversely, does this technology reduce core network cost, which then would enable more resources to be deployed back into the RAN?
So now I'll spend a few minutes on several emerging technologies which we believe are or will be incorporated into future mobile network deployments and address those 3 critical questions for each.
First, let's start with self-optimizing networks or SONs and software-defined networks or SDNs. SONs allow networks to be more intelligent by dynamically managing traffic. This helps carriers reduce expensive truck rolls to make physical network equipment adjustments in the field. Meanwhile, SDNs provide carriers with a tool to add new network functionality and services through simple software upgrades, dramatically reducing time and cost. Both the SON and SDN network primarily enhance the efficiency of the core side of carrier networks and help operators reduce OpEx and CapEx there. So we view both of these technologies as neutral to positive for tower demand.
Next, let's address cloud RAN or CRAN technology, which enables carriers to centralize the base stations of several cell sites at the data center, instead of having dedicated ground-based equipment at each tower site. As a result, the carriers are able to reduce their base station cost and enhance the processing efficiency of the mobile core portion of the network. While there are ground space requirements at the base of towers can decrease with CRAN in use, the amount of equipment on our towers themselves is unaffected, or in some cases, actually increases, as remote radio heads are installed on the tower. So for tower operator, we also expect CRAN to be typically neutral to net positive.
As you can see on Slide 19, it is our understanding that none of the technologies I just mentioned materially enhance airlink capacity or extend effective signal ratings. Conversely, when it comes to whether or not these innovations have the capability to decrease carrier operating expense on the core side of the network, the answer is yes. Over the long term, they should be a positive for the tower industry.
Turning to the airlink side of the network. There have been technological improvements which over time have improved network capacity. For example, carrier aggregation has enabled mobile operators to deploy unpaired spectrum usually with high and low bands together all on one site. This adds network capacity in the short term as spectrum assets are more effectively utilized. But in the long term, we believe this will actually lead to increased cell site densification as the design requirements of the highest frequency band spectrum will dictate ultimate network density and overall design requirements. Our estimate is that over the last few years, capacity gains from the spectrum and higher spectral efficiency of LTE has absorbed roughly 20% to 30% of incremental network usage, leaving the 70% to 80% being sold through additional cell sites and equipment on our towers. As I've highlighted in past calls, the laws of physics govern the properties of RF signal propagation and thereby limit the impact that many changes in technology can have to the airlink portion of a mobile network. For example, in the largely suburban and rural areas served by our U.S. towers, antenna elevations of at least 75 feet above ground level are usually needed for effective signal transmission. And antennas that are upwards of 10-feet tall also continue to be required for the specific spectrum bands being used and the cell radius being served in these topologies. In addition, higher bandwidth data traffic requires more signal propagation locations to ensure sufficient signal strength and more equipment at those locations the process that signal as well. And these trends drive solid core organic growth that you've seen in our business year after year. Given a topographic and demographic characteristics of the United States and our international markets, we continue to expect the macro tower to be the predominant siting solution for carrier network deployments now and in the future.
Additionally, the improvement of technology in the mobile core should enable the carriers to deploy relatively more capital on their radio access network build-outs to keep up with the demand. This may be especially relevant with the much higher throughput expected on future 5G networks and beyond. Moreover, our international operations continue to benefit from the increasing availability of cheaper, more advanced smartphones and the greater ability of many more people around the world to afford them. Mobile connectivity is revolutionizing communications, commerce and entertainment in the developing world. And we think that in many of our served markets, the modernization cycle is actually accelerating. As you can see on Slide 20, we are positioned internationally with a diverse portfolio of assets in markets where the rate of growth in mobile data traffic is likely to outpace even that of the U.S.
An excellent example of this phenomenon is in India, which will be our largest international market pro forma for the close of our recently announced Viom transaction. The wireless sector in India is roughly in the same stage as the U.S. was in around 2005, with smartphone penetration of less than 25% and the vast majority of the population still on 2G technology. Like what occurred in the U.S., a fundamental shift towards more advanced wireless technology is now underway in India, with the major carriers announcing significant network build plans for 3G and even the initial rollout of 4G, beginning in key urban metros where Viom is especially well positioned.
Another compelling example of a market that's still early in the wireless technology curve is Nigeria. Similar to India, there's virtually no fixed-line infrastructure in place there. The large predominantly young population of more than 170 million people has embraced wireless, but more than 80% of the devices being used in Nigeria are still on 2G. Cheaper, more advanced handsets are expected to drive significant growth in mobile data traffic, and carriers there are making significant investments in the networks to capitalize on the shift. Taken together, we expect our diverse and substantial international assets to deliver growth that would be stronger for longer than even in the U.S.
And given the consumer and industry trends in the U.S. and across our global footprint, we do expect to continue to deliver strong, long-term growth in AFFO and very attractive total returns for our shareholders.

U.S. applications, as Tom said, are up slightly from the second to third quarter this year. And I can give you a quick run-through of where we see the demand coming from, largely based frankly on the public statements of the carriers, but we can give you a little more color on some of it. Our largest new business customers over the last couple of quarters have been Verizon and T-Mobile, sort of running neck and neck in a way the last 6 months, I'd say. And T-Mobile, in the field, we see them deploying aggressively their 700-megahertz A block spectrum. That's going to give them a stronger signal in places they don't have it. They're also doing a roaming overbuilt, which continues because of the success of their subscriber additions. They can actually make the decision to put network equipment in place in more territories across the United States, and they're doing that. So T-Mobile is being pretty aggressive this year. Verizon is pretty stable and steady. Their wireless CapEx is up almost 20% year-to-date from 2014. They guided, I think, to $8.6 billion for mobile spending for CapEx in 2015, very aggressively deploying AWS spectrum across their markets to handle the data demand that they're seeing from their customer base and again in a pretty stable sort of spending and deployment schedule in our estimation. AT&T continues to be growing, I guess we call it. They were our biggest customer for new business from late 2013 to mid-2014. And they've taken the intervening years to groom that investment, to make sure that it's effectively being utilized for its subscriber base. They're guiding -- as everybody I think knows, a little bit less from year-to-year CapEx spending, they're at $6.6 billion. So just as a reference, if Verizon is at $8.6 billion in 2015 and AT&T is at $6.6 billion, how does that feature comparison or trend play out, I think everybody can sort of draw around conclusions on that. But we do expect AT&T to continue to be competitive over the next few years on the network side of the business. They are also going to be looking at deploying as Verizon, AWS-3, once that gets kind of cleared and available. What's interesting to us about AWS-3 and especially the fact that Verizon and AT&T spend collectively almost $20 billion for that spectrum is it -- that means that the fundamental 4G network, which is based on 700-megahertz spectrum today, is going to be complemented essentially nationally by 1.7 and 2.1 spectrum, which doesn't have the same favorable transmission characteristics, of course, as 700. So what we view AWS-3 long-term deployment in terms of companies like American Tower is that you're going to have a dense network for 4G at the end of the day to carry the traffic. And so you see that business now with various carriers deploying AWS and other pieces of spectrum, including Sprint, with its 2.5. But as the time goes on, the only way to carry this traffic that we've been describing is going to be with AWS and higher spectrum. The sites are going to ultimately have to be closer together, we think. And that will take time. It will play out over a series of years, but we do think [indiscernible] underpin some pretty good U.S. growth for the long term. And then finally, just to make mention on Sprint. I believe they're still in the midst of finalizing their network strategy. And once they do that, we'll hear more from them on exactly how they want to go through without deployment. And again, they're going to be putting in spectrum bands for essentially 4G. They're going to be much, much higher frequency than some they're already using today. And eventually, that bodes for denser network, even for Sprint when they're ready to make those investments. So I think I'll stop there and turn it over to Tom."

Sure On the second question relative to small cells, we had about 300 indoor DAS systems. We just had over 30 ODAS systems, over 20,000 rooftop rights now available for small cell and macro cell activity. Those are comprised by 6% of our AMT domestic rental and management revenue. And as I mentioned, we generated just over 30%, excluding the amortization. From a tenancy perspective on the venue-based assets, we're generating -- we have 2.3 tenants per tower or per node. Gross margins in the 75% range versus the ODAS, which as we've said before, is much lower at the 1.1 50% kind of margin levels. But strategically, we continue to think that in most areas in the U.S., the macro towers are going to be the optimal transmission points. We believe it's cost and technology primitive outside of dense urban areas to use a small cells to great degree just because siting cost needs to run [indiscernible] things like that. However, as we said in dense urban areas with population densities of 10,000 per square mile, we think that small cells can make sense, and if key point though is you can make a multitenant model out of it, manage technology risk and higher cost associated with the ownership of electronics and Firebird at those kind of levels. Our conclusion as far as [indiscernible] multitenant model where you can earn good long-term economic returns exist, more so in indoor DAS types of installation. And as a result, we've got those 300 indoor DAS systems in the U.S. and another 100 internationally. So our ODAS presence is a lot smaller because we [indiscernible] found the returns there to be as compelling relative to all the investment opportunities that we have. So we continue to participate meaningfully in small sales, but are really careful to make sure that we're investing capital where we can find a multitenant model."

And quarter in, quarter out, there could be some fluctuations on that over the long term. That's exactly what we're striving to do. And there are a number of elements to it. As I've said before, we kind of walk and chew gum at the same time because we're constantly reinvesting our business in terms of acquiring new assets that are providing future opportunities for growth. We look at things on an AFFO per share basis because to the extent those opportunities don't exist for future investments that don't meet our own internal hurdle requirements, then we'll return cash back to shareholders and that obviously would take shares in the market and provide an opportunity to increase AFFO per share that way. But that is our goal. I mean that we have the opportunity now of being able to invest in many different markets. And so we're not limited to just investing in one market. And so we have a broad array of looking at where we can create the most net present value. And I think we have the engine working. We have a really good machine here in terms of being able to mention that process. Our R&D really the value that we have in a contract. That's really where we're able to create the value, and we have a long term disability on that because the contracts are so long. So we continue to hone in on our -- on things like SG&A to make sure that we're leveraging that as best as we possibly can. It's the beauty of the model that when you do bring on that incremental dollar revenue, you're like we've been able to demonstrate, you're bringing $0.90 of that dollar down to the gross margin line. So that's a wonderful thing that we've been able to do in a global basis. And again it comes at the quality of the assets, but more importantly, even to the quality of the contracts and the quality of the relationship that we have with our customers on a global basis. So that's what we do day in and day out, to try to leverage the portfolios that we have and leverage the assets and the people that we've got in the business to make the right investment decisions terms of systems and all those kind of more and operational things that we do behind the curtain to make sure that we really can continue the kind of growth. So long answer saying, that's our plan, that's our goal. And that's what Jim and I do and as well as the entire executive team do every day."

First of all, it's important to point out that AT&T is our biggest customer, not only in the U.S, globally and now also in Mexico. So we have an excellent, I think, business relationship with AT&T across the board. There's always things to talk about on contracts and such, but what we've done in the U.S. is determined a way to have naturally beneficial contractual arrangements with AT&T, especially in periods where it's growing its network rapidly. And so we've replicated the same sort of arrangement with AT&T in Mexico, which is again over half of our revenue base in the country. And let me just speak to that a second -- for one more minute, and then I'll turn it over time to Tom to add some more of the data behind it. So we have a unified master lease agreement with AT&T, covers all of our site leases under the previous cell agreement and extend all those leases for 14 years, which is a really nice, long time horizon to have a guaranteed revenue stream from all those leases. This agreement also guarantees our company certain levels of new business from AT&T Mexico over the next several years, with some potential upside on top of that, depending on how active they think they need to get in the network. And again, we believe it's going to be mutually beneficial to American Tower and AT&T. And also specifically, for our customer, provides access of flexibility for them regarding all of our Mexico assets to help efficiently accelerate their network upgrade strategy. We want to be their partner in that. So I also wanted to note that the with the acquisition of DirecTV, AT&T is now not only our top 5 new business customer in the U.S. and Mexico, but it's also in the third quarter in the top 5 in Brazil, Colombia and Peru as well. So that's demonstrating its expanding geographic scope of our partnership with that particular company and is another example of us having global, multitenant, high-level carrier relationships that can really extend around the world, in some cases, and drive stable revenue growth for the long term, and in this case again, 14-year kind of extension. Tom?"

I mean, Jim kind of walked through kind of the presence, our customer presence on our towers and percentage of revenue. I mean AT&T represents a significant piece, Telefonica represents about 20%, 21%. AT&T, up in the 60% level. As we've mentioned in the past, the organic core growth has picked up nicely. It's now in a double-digit kind of quarter gain of growth. As that market come out of a period of a couple of years, because [indiscernible] I think the regulatory environment there has been, as I said before, little bit sleepy. And so now we're starting to see a pickup of growth in that market as the carriers, as Jim mentioned, are deploying 4G. And I think that's us cautiously optimistic in terms of the growth that we would expect to come from the market to going forward. 90% wireless penetration, only 35% smartphone penetration, 45% 3G and 4G penetration, kind of a $10 to $11 ARPU. I think the LTE investments are still very much in the early stages. CapEx down there is still in the 15% to 20% range, and we believe will be higher, given what we've heard AT&T and America Mobile announced publicly. We believe, like Brazil, that the market needs can of twice the number of towers to support 4G over the long term. And so as I mentioned, the team has really nice -- I think really well in terms of managing the portfolio that the bad down there. It's growing significantly. We're building towers for our customers in the marketplace. It's our second-largest Latin American market, probably runs around kind of that $300 million, $350 million range. So it's a sizable market for us, and I think it's really going to contribute nicely to our overall core organic growth over the next several years."

Wonder in your MLA with AT&T in the United States, my understanding is that's going to be expiring soon. And that at least more recently, you benefited from that MLA in terms of growth you recognized from AT&T despite lower activity from them. And I guess my question is, if you don't renew that MLA with them as you go into 2016, what's the potential impact on revenue which you recognize from them without that MLA? The second question is on international escalators. Can you just remind us what percentage of international escalators are tied to CPI-type benchmarks, what the average rates been in 2015, and based on where rates are now, what that rate could be in 2016?"

We don't speak to the specific timing and terms of master lease agreement. But in general, just so you know the concept, that these holistic agreements have a period of years during which there's a lot of flexibility, as I mentioned earlier, what the carrier can do. There are limitations to equipment rights and other limitations within those. But at a certain point, those widely available rights will then revert back to retail model, if you will, which is individual application for every single thing that the carrier wants to do. And we just go back to business as usual or pre-holistic practice, which is we'll price that application and will individually negotiate it. And we'll end up getting our revenue that way. So the concept is that as long as there's demand, we'll get nice revenue growth from the same customer, whether it's holistic or not. What the holistic does is that it reduces any kind of downward risk over a period of time. And there's quite a few years to run on the individual site leases with AT&T well beyond the point where that switchover might happen. And again, so we're not speaking to you with the progress in negotiation, exact timing of when these things happen, but that is the general concept. And I think AT&T is going to again be competitive in the U.S. market. It's one of their -- it's not their core business, one of their top core businesses in the corporation. And we expect them to be trying to capture as much of that rising demand for data as they can within their financial plan."

Let me be really clear. The Master lease is not expiring, okay? There are certain elements that Jim talked about that changed over that period of time, but the MLA is not expiring, so I just want to make sure that you understand -- that you clearly understood that. Because they also saw that in some writeups, and I just want to be very, very clear on that. With regards to the escalators. About 90% of our revenue on international markets is tied to inflation. And in each of those markets, there are indices, CPI indices, that are used for determining what that inflation would be and how that then would impact the ongoing leases and the revenue stream in those markets. And that happens throughout the year whenever that lease was originally put on the base. So it won't all happen as of January 1. There are some cap floors, maxis on that. But we think it's a very good way for us to be able to minimize the impacts of that. I'll also mention that we also have similar types of escalators on our land, okay? So it's not just the revenue that we have it on, it's also on the land cost. But just to give you a sense in the -- even in the third quarter, our escalators in our international markets was probably about 4.5%. So it clearly provides some benefits. And we would expect, given the levels of inflation over the -- that we've seen over the last 18 months -- 12 to 18 months, that we would start to see some of that benefit as we have in queue -- in 2015, but I think we'll see even probably a higher level of impact in 2016."

We have said a number of times in the past, we don't have a specific revenue split target for U.S. versus our international markets. But just as a reference, because of the size, the pricing structures, the strength of the contracts that Tom already mentioned, the U.S. still delivers 75% of the operating income of the company, right? So that's going to be a very big flywheel that itself grows over a long period of time. And there's a smaller flywheel of international operating income that's going to grow faster for a longer period of time. So those 2 things actually complement each other, and we don't have a specific target of how the math ought to work in, say, year 5 or year 10. But we will continue to do is look both in the U.S. and outside for investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria, right, which is meaningful AFFO per share, growth opportunity at asset prices that give us a good opportunity to also keep ROIC stable and rising over time as well, okay? That's how we make those investment decisions. The benefit of having the global aperture, as we look at those investment decisions, it gives us a lot more things to look at. Many of those things will meet our investment criteria, we'll go through them. A couple of those have happened already this year in the case of Tim -- Air TIM, Airtel and now Viom. We also had an aperture open in the domestic side, and we made a very significant agreement with Verizon, as everybody knows earlier this year. And then there's a lot of things we don't have to do because we have the wide aperture. There's a couple of other carrier deals that didn't meet our asset pricing objective, and you didn't see us win those. There's many international deals because we have again both sides of the street to play on that we don't take because we don't think we have to take them to grow inorganically. So those are think are the benefits of having the global team in place, the track record, these multinational customer relationships. The diversification will naturally happen because, as you know, 60% of the sites, and it will be greater next year, contingent on our Viom closing. But outside the U.S., we're going to grow faster and longer. So this is actually going to evolve over time, but there aren't any targets. Tom?"

As far as FirstNet, there's definitely progress on schedule RFPs being put together. It's going to be upwards of a 6-month review process. And the goal of the FirstNet management is to choose not only its partners but its actual structure of operation. And it's going to be something that we're going to participate in as closely as we can. We don't know how this is really going to play out in the [indiscernible] who's going to participate as far as operators, OEMs, other kinds of sort of prime contractors that can get involved. So we're going to keep all our options open and deal across the board with potential teammates as this evolves and with FirstNet, to the extent that we can deal with them directly. So there's definitely an opportunity here. There's a need of good -- of better public safety network, a 4G-based, in this country. FirstNet is going to drive that. And we plan, of course, to participate in it, although we can't assess the value of the actual leads stream down the road yet. And then as far as consolidation risk in Brazil, the tradeoff for us has always been -- as you pointed out, we need at least 3, we think, well-funded, successful mobile operators in the market to get to optimal long-term outcome for our company. And so whether it's 5, counting Nextel in Brazil today, or 4 or 3, over the 10- to 20-year time horizon, as long as they're funded in a way that they can drive 4G penetration to 100% and then get to that 2, 4, 6 gigabyte a month usage level, it's going to be terrifically constructive for the tower business. Our overlaps in Brazil happen to be really modest. [indiscernible] serve as biggest cycle on the rumor scale, I guess, as far as potential consolidation. And if they were to emerge, as an example, we don't expect this. But just to give you again context, the overlap in our towers in Brazil is only 1% of consolidated revenues, and we have 8 or 9 years on average left on these contracts. So we don't view industry consolidation in Brazil as a material threat to the business. Certainly, in the mid to long term, it wouldn't affect it, I don't think."

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our financial and operational performance for the third quarter as well as our full year outlook for 2015; and then Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss recent technology trends, how they will impact the mobile value chain and how our diversified portfolio of assets positions us to drive compelling returns for shareholders well into the future. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding: our 2015 outlook, foreign currency exchange rate and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our future growth, technology industry trends, anticipated closings of acquisitions, anticipated contributions of pending acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in yesterday's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and in our other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligations to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our third quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 20% from the third quarter of 2014 to over $1.21 billion. During the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to approximately $779 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased by more than 21% to approximately $558 million. 
During the quarter, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by approximately $124 million to about $76 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted common share. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decline in net income were the one-time $93 million cash tax charge as part of our previously announced GTP REIT tax election and approximately $78 million related to unrealized foreign currency losses, attributable to our intercompany balances. 
Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire a 51% controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. Please note that given the regulatory process associated with the transaction, we will not be in a position to provide detail on our future expectations regarding the acquisition until that process has concluded.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

As you can see, we had a solid third quarter from both an organic and inorganic growth perspective. In addition, we continued to add assets in select key markets where we believe the opportunity for long-term sustainable growth is compelling. This includes the acquisition of the nearly 4,700 towers in Nigeria that we closed in July, and the follow-on close of an additional 1,100 sites in Brazil from TIM at the end of September. And as Leah said, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire 51% controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. This transaction will expand our tower footprint there to over 57,000 sites, while materially enhancing our ability to help all of the countries' major carriers as they deploy 3G and 4G nationwide. 
As we said previously, we believe India is 5 to 10 years behind the U.S. in terms of wireless technology deployments. And given just a 4% fixed-line penetration in a population of over 1 billion people, predominantly using 2G technology, India is a very attractive market for a tower operator like ourselves. In addition, this transaction is also expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and will help us continue to achieve our aspirational goal of annual double-digit AFFO per share growth over the long term.
If you'll please turn to Slide 6, let's now talk about our quarterly results. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by 20% to just over $1.2 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was more than 27%, and of this core growth, over 7% was organic. The balance of our core growth, or approximately 20%, was attributable to properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including over 12,000 sites domestically and about 20,000 sites in our international markets, with over 5,000 of the total sites that we built ourselves. The Verizon, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brazil portfolios comprised the bulk of the inorganic core growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management segment generated core growth in revenue of about 21% during the third quarter, with organic core growth and revenue of about 6%. On a year-to-date basis, our domestic organic core revenue growth was about 7%. Our annual organic core growth rate continues to benefit from the elevated decommissioning revenues we've recognized in 2015. As we've previously discussed, decommissioning revenues are expected to be around $38 million for 2015, which is higher than the $21 million we received in 2014. And year-to-date, as of the end of the third quarter, we received about $29 million in decommissioning revenues as compared to about $18 million to the same period in 2014. T-Mobile and Verizon drove the majority of our commenced new business in Q3 and continue to comprise the bulk of our new business pipeline. In addition to solid commencement activity, we saw a slight sequential improvement in signed new business during the quarter. Overall, our U.S. business continues to deliver good performance, with organic growth for the year expected to be right in the middle of our long-term target range. In addition, our new Verizon sites are performing in line with our expectations and the integration process is progressing on schedule.
Our domestic rental and management gross margin increased by about 17% on both the reported and core basis to $621 million and reflected a 63% revenue conversion rate. Excluding the Verizon sites, this conversion rate would have been over 90%. In other words, $0.90 of every incremental dollar of organic revenue is falling to the gross margin line.
We also continue to invest in our domestic business, and during the quarter, we constructed 22 towers and added 2 new DAS systems. While our DAS business continues to comprise a small portion of our domestic revenues, it is growing quickly. On a year-to-date basis, for example, revenue from DAS systems grew over 30% over the prior year period, excluding the impacts of any amortization revenue derived from capital contributions.
In addition to investing in new construction in the U.S., we had a record quarter of land management activity, purchasing about 250 parcels and extending ground leases on about 630 of our sites, with the extensions averaging 31 years. Around 62% of the land under our U.S. towers is now either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we would expect to get that number up to 80% within the next 5 years.
Reported in core domestic rental and management operating profit growth was about 18%. This reflects strong revenue growth, our continuing focus on property level cost controls and SG&A as a percentage of revenue of under 4%.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter, with reported growth of about 17% and core growth of about 44%. Organic core growth and revenue was nearly 11%. All of our international regions continue to deliver strong, organic core growth. We are particularly encouraged by the continuing strong trends in Africa, where organic core growth was once again over 20% in markets like Ghana and Uganda. Reported international revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation effects of about $100 million as compared to the prior year period.
We saw a strong demand in the quarter with markets such as Mexico, Peru and South Africa all generating double-digit sequential growth in signed new business. Large investment-grade tenants like AT&T, Vodafone and Telefónica continue to comprise the majority of our international revenues and organic new business growth. Additionally, although our operating history in Nigeria has only been a few months, performance relative to new business commencements in the market is already exceeding expectations. We also further solidified our international revenue growth visibility by signing a long-term master lease agreement with AT&T in Mexico.
In addition, we continue to invest in our existing markets through new tower construction and built over 730 new towers across our international footprint. We added nearly 400 towers for tenants like Bharti and Vodafone in India and had an exceptionally strong quarter of newbuild activity in Brazil with over 230 new sites constructed, primarily for Vivo and TIM. We also added 9 international DAS systems in the quarter, bringing our international DAS system count to 137 systems. 
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 13% to about $240 million. Our reported international operating profit grew nearly 15% to $205 million, and the operating profit margin percentage was about 51%.
Excluding pass-through revenue, our international operating margin expanded over 120 basis points to 72% as compared to the prior year period. Our core growth in international operating profit was 48%.
Turning to Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 17%, with core growth of about 26% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 63%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was about 70%. We've been able to maintain this rate while adding roughly 30,000 towers with an average tenancy of 1.3 tenants per tower over the last year. Our adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio was approximately 65%, excluding pass-through, or around 90% if you exclude the impacts of adding the new lower-tenancy Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria assets to the base.
Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was under 8%. And for the full year, we expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be just over 8% versus the 9% and 10% rates of 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Longer term, we expect this annual percentage to continue to decline further as we leverage our existing SG&A base while driving organic growth.
Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased over 21% to $558 million or $1.31 per share. Core AFFO growth was nearly 33%, and our adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio during the quarter was just under 87%.
Moving on to Slide 10. We are revising our 2015 rental and management segment revenue outlook to $4.65 billion at the midpoint, which reflects additional foreign currency translation effects of about $56 million relative to our prior outlook due to the strengthening dollar, which will be largely offset by organic outperformance of our legacy international assets of around $5 million; additional straight line revenue of about $16 million, principally due to our newly executed master lease agreement in Mexico with AT&T; additional pass-through revenue of about $10 million versus our prior outlook; and about $5 million in additional revenue from the 1,125 TIM Brazil sites we closed on September 30.
For the year, we expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 23%. This includes organic core growth expectations of about 7% and nearly 11% for our domestic and international segments, respectively, resulting in a consolidated annual organic core growth rate of 8%.
Moving forward, we expect our international markets to benefit from rising escalators attributable to higher inflation measures in the local markets, which should help support international organic core growth and provide some additional insulation from foreign exchange translation effects.
Despite slightly lowered revenue expectations due to the strengthening dollar, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook midpoint by $5 million to $3.05 billion. This reflects both the strong revenue growth of our core business and ongoing cost management, which are more than offsetting the increased unfavorable FX impact to adjusted EBITDA of about $30 million relative to our prior outlook. We now expect core growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 22%, which is about 90 basis points higher than our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We're also raising our full year AFFO outlook by $10 million to $2.13 billion at the midpoint. This is being driven by around $23 million in incremental cash EBITDA from our sites, about $9 million in reduced maintenance and corporate CapEx and $5 million in reduced cash interest. This is being partially offset by an incremental $27 million in negative foreign currency translation effects versus our prior AFFO outlook. Our AFFO growth is now expected to be over 17% for the year or about 27% on a core basis. We expect our AFFO per share growth at the midpoint to be nearly 11% or almost 20% on a core basis. Consequently, we now expect to generate over $5 per share of AFFO for the full year.
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, which we believe will support our business in generating consistently strong growth across a variety of business and economic cycles. We are focused on simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
So far this year, we've committed nearly $9 billion to our M&A program, including our pending Viom transaction; declared about $620 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends; and deployed over $500 million in CapEx. About 40% of our annual CapEx spend is for the construction of an expected 3,000 new build-to-suit sites based on the midpoint of our outlook. Year-to-date, we've completed the construction of over 2,300 sites and have generated a first year return on investment of over 9% of the sites on a consolidated basis. 
We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and our REIT distribution will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in the REIT distribution of at least 20%, which has actually been 30% or so over the last 12 months. Our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO is currently about 35% and is expected to grow to between 40% and 50% within the next few years due to anticipated growth in our taxable income and the reduction of our net operating loss carryforwards. We also seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and had about $2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers as of the end of the quarter. 
From a capital markets' perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to opportunistically extend duration and ladder out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of nearly 6 years, with an average interest cost of about 3.4%. We took steps towards obtaining these goals just this week, as we extended the maturity dates of our credit facilities and term loan. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range. Additionally, we expect to be at 5x or below by the end of 2016, including the impact of our recently announced Viom transaction. We expect to evaluate a variety of financing options for this transaction and our other funding needs in keeping with our commitment to investment grade while maximizing the value for our equity holders. 
Our long-term target leverage range continues to be between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And over the long term, we intend to utilize our solid financial platform to continue to invest in global, multitenant commercial real estate assets where it makes financial sense to do so. And if those opportunities aren't available, return that generated cash back to our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 13. And in summary, our global business has generated core growth above our long-term target for all key metrics so far this year, and we believe we are well positioned to finish the year strong. Our high-quality asset base, strong balance sheet and manageable leverage positions us well to continue to invest in future growth with our recently announced Viom transaction as a prime example. This transaction will significantly increase our presence in a key global market, increase our portfolio's exposure to India's densely populated areas and enhance our role in the government's Digital India initiative. This is an exciting time to further increase our presence in India, as the market appears to be at a significant inflection point in terms of wireless network investment, and we are excited to help our customers further enhance their wireless networks in the market. Trends across the rest of the markets in our diversified global footprint continue to be favorable as well, with consumer demand for our mobile data increasing at a tremendous pace. Including the impact of Viom, we now have a strong presence in the 4 largest, most strategic markets across the continents we serve.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As we do every year on our third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on the fundamental trends in wireless usage and technology, which we believe, will continue to drive network investment and long-term growt",1772,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As we do every year on our third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on the fundamental trends in wireless usage and technology, which we believe, will continue to drive network investment and long-term growth for American Tower.
So let's begin with U.S. mobile data usage, trends and projections as illustrated on Slide 15. The monthly mobile data usage per subscriber on smartphones, laptops and especially tablets is projected to increase significantly, as people seek to mobilize more and more aspects of their daily routine. We believe this growth in mobile data traffic is principally a result of a virtuous cycle. 
First, after years of significant investment, mobile networks today are more capable than ever at delivering the necessary speeds to support high-bandwidth data and entertainment applications. Second, mobile device, processor, battery, software and screen improvements are facilitating increased mobile app navigation, music and video consumption. For example, leading-edge new LTE devices like the iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S6, continue to expand the scope of what we can do on a mobile handset. And whether it's a simple phone call, listening to your favorite music streaming service or getting turn-by-turn directions while driving in your car, a strong, continuous mobile phone signal is becoming ever more essential. As a result, current projections are for the average U.S. smartphone to consume more than 7.5 gigabytes per month in mobile data by 2019, up from around just 2 gigabytes today.
An even greater increase in average usage is projected for network-connected tablets, which are expected to consume nearly double the amount of an average smartphone by 2019. Whether it's streaming an NFL game on 4G at the airport or entertaining your kids with an iPad on a long road trip, mobile video connectivity is becoming more mainstream. This transformation is being fueled by the wire-to-mobile conversion of social media and branded-video content, especially by over-the-top providers such as Netflix.
The cumulative impact of these usage trends is shown on Slide 16. After nearly quadrupling in the last 3 years, total U.S. mobile data usage is expected to more than quadruple again by 2019. Since the early part of the 2000s, carriers have invested nearly $350 billion in wireless CapEx, as illustrated by the gray shading on Slide 17. They're using this cash to build out their nationwide mobile networks to support the fixed-to-mobile conversion of first telephony, then Internet services, and most recently, social media and entertainment. Each new generation of technology has in turn resulted in explosive growth of traffic on those enhanced networks and then a subsequent step function increase in network investment levels completing the virtuous cycle.
There are 2 facets of mobile network investment, which are depicted on the next slide. The first is known as the core side of the network. The fixed-line portion of the system, which consists of the switches, servers and related electronics; the fiberoptic cable and copper that connects all these major components together; and the software that makes it all work. The other side of the network is known as the RAN, or radio access network, and is made up of the widely distributed transmission or cell sites. Each cell then utilizes an airlink over radio spectrum to reach your device over-the-air. At American Tower, we play only on the RAN side of the network, and demand for our real estate goes up directly whenever more transmission equipment, such as antennas, is required for capacity or when new cell locations are needed for coverage. Moreover, our demand goes up indirectly when improvements in the core network reduce its cost of operation, potentially freeing up more capital and/or OpEx resources for the RAN and its many cell site. Therefore, it's crucial to view technology and industry developments as they relate to American Tower by asking 3 simple questions about each. First, does this particular technology significantly improve airlink capacity, and thus reduce the need for equipment on towers? Second, does this technology significantly increase the distance a high-quality wireless signal can travel, allowing sites to be positioned further apart? And third, conversely, does this technology reduce core network costs, which then would enable more resources to be deployed back into the RAN?
So now I'll spend a few minutes on several emerging technologies which we believe are or will be incorporated into future mobile network deployments and address those 3 critical questions for each.
First, let's start with self-optimizing networks or SONs and software-defined networks or SDNs. SONs allow networks to be more intelligent by dynamically managing traffic. This helps carriers reduce expensive truck rolls to make physical network equipment adjustments in the field. Meanwhile, SDNs provide carriers with a tool to add new network functionality and services through simple software upgrades, dramatically reducing time and cost. Both the SON and SDN therefore primarily enhance the efficiency of the core side of carrier networks and help operators reduce OpEx and CapEx there. So we view both of these technologies as neutral to positive for tower demand.
Next, let's address cloud RAN or C-RAN technology, which enables carriers to centralize the base stations of several cell sites at a data center, instead of having dedicated ground-based equipment at each tower site. As a result, the carriers are able to reduce their base station costs and enhance the processing efficiency of the mobile core portion of their networks. While there are ground space requirements at the base of towers can decrease with C-RAN in use. The amount of equipment on the towers themselves is unaffected, or in some cases, actually increases, as remote radio heads are installed on the tower. So for tower operator, we also expect C-RAN to be typically neutral to net positive.
As you can see on Slide 19, it is our understanding that none of the technologies I just mentioned materially enhance airlink capacity or extend effective signal ratings. Conversely, when it comes to whether or not these innovations have the capability to decrease carrier operating expense on the core side of the network, the answer is yes. Over the long term, they should be a positive for the tower industry.
Turning to the airlink side of the network. There have been technological improvements which over time have improved network capacity. For example, carrier aggregation has enabled mobile operators to deploy unpaired spectrum usually with high and low bands together all on one site. This adds network capacity in the short term as spectrum assets are more effectively utilized. But in the long term, we believe this will actually lead to increased cell site densification as the design requirements of the highest frequency band spectrum will dictate ultimate network density and overall design requirements. Our estimate is that over the last few years, capacity gains from new spectrum and higher spectral efficiency of LTE has absorbed roughly 20% to 30% of incremental network usage, leaving the 70% to 80% being absorbed through additional cell sites and equipment on our towers. As I've highlighted in past calls, the laws of physics govern the properties of RF signal propagation and thereby limit the impact that many changes in technology can have to the airlink portion of a mobile network. For example, in the largely suburban and rural areas served by our U.S. towers, antenna elevations of at least 75 feet above ground level are usually needed for effective signal transmission. And antennas that are upwards of 10-feet tall also continue to be required for the specific spectrum bands being used and the cell radius being served in these topologies. In addition, higher bandwidth data traffic requires more signal propagation locations to ensure sufficient signal strength and more equipment at those locations to process that signal as well. And these trends drive solid core organic growth that you've seen in our business year after year. Given the topographic and demographic characteristics of the United States and our international markets, we continue to expect the macro tower to be the predominant siting solution for carrier network deployments now and in the future.
Additionally, the improvement of technology in the mobile core should enable the carriers to deploy relatively more capital on their radio access network build-outs to keep up with the demand. This may be especially relevant with the much higher throughput expected on future 5G networks and beyond. Moreover, our international operations continue to benefit from the increasing availability of cheaper, more advanced smartphones and the greater ability of many more people around the world to afford them. Mobile connectivity is revolutionizing communications, commerce and entertainment in the developing world, and we think that in many of our served markets, the modernization cycle is actually accelerating.
As you can see on Slide 20, we are positioned internationally with a diverse portfolio of assets in markets where the rate of growth in mobile data traffic is likely to outpace even that of the U.S.  An excellent example of this phenomenon is in India, which will be our largest international market pro forma for the close of our recently announced Viom transaction. The wireless sector in India is roughly in the same stage as the U.S. was in around 2005, with smartphone penetration of less than 25% and the vast majority of the population still on 2G technology. Like what occurred in the U.S., a fundamental shift towards more advanced wireless technology is now underway in India, with the major carriers announcing significant network build plans for 3G and even the initial rollout of 4G, beginning in key urban metros where Viom is especially well positioned.
Another compelling example of a market that's still early in the wireless technology curve is Nigeria. Similar to India, there's virtually no fixed-line infrastructure in place there. The large predominantly young population of more than 170 million people has embraced wireless, but more than 80% of the devices being used in Nigeria are still on 2G. Cheaper, more advanced handsets are expected to drive significant growth in mobile data traffic, and carriers there are making significant investments in their networks to capitalize on this shift. Taken together, we expect our diverse and substantial international assets to deliver growth that would be stronger for longer than even in the U.S.
And given the consumer and industry trends in the U.S. and across our global footprint, we do expect to continue to deliver strong, long-term growth in AFFO and very attractive total returns for our shareholders.
So thanks again for joining us today. And Tom and I will now be happy to take your questions. So operator, can you please go ahead and open up the call?"

I was wondering if you could provide some updated color on what you're seeing in terms of application activity, as we've seen fluctuating behavior from different carriers in the U.S. through the course of 2015. So any incremental color that you could provide there would be helpful. And then dovetailing on that, you mentioned that -- I think, Tom, you mentioned that your DAS business is up 30% year-to-date. Can you provide some insight on the size and scope of that business? And how we should think about that opportunity for you folks going forward?

U.S. applications, as Tom said, are up slightly from the second to third quarter of this year. And I can give you a quick run-through of where we see the demand coming from, largely based frankly on the public statements of the carriers, but we can give you a little more color on some of it. Our largest new business customers over the last couple of quarters have been Verizon and T-Mobile, sort of running neck and neck in a way over the last 6 months, I'd say. And T-Mobile, in the field, we see them deploying aggressively their 700-megahertz A block spectrum. That's going to give them a stronger signal in places they don't have it. They're also doing a roaming overbuild, which continues because of the success of their subscriber additions. They can actually make the decisions to put network equipment in place in more territories across the United States, and they're doing that. So T-Mobile is being pretty aggressive this year. Verizon is pretty stable and steady. Their wireless CapEx is up almost 20% year-to-date from 2014. They guided, I think, to $8.6 billion for mobile spending for CapEx in 2015. They're aggressively deploying AWS spectrum across their markets to handle the data demand that they're seeing from their customer base and again on a pretty stable sort of spending and deployment schedule in our estimation. AT&T continues to be growing, I guess we call it. They were our biggest customer for new business from late 2013 to mid-2014. And they've taken the intervening year or so to groom that investment, to make sure that it's effectively being utilized for its subscriber base. They're guiding -- as everybody I think knows, a little bit less from year-to-year CapEx spending, they're at $6.6 billion. So just as a reference, if Verizon is at $8.6 billion in 2015 and AT&T is at $6.6 billion, how does that feature comparison or trend play out? I think everybody could sort of drive around conclusions on that, but we do expect AT&T to continue to be competitive over the next few years on the network side of the business. They are also going to be looking at deploying as Verizon AWS-3, once that gets kind of cleared and available. What's interesting to us about AWS-3 and especially the fact that Verizon and AT&T spent collectively almost $20 billion for that spectrum is -- it means that the fundamental 4G network, which is based on 700-megahertz spectrum today, is going to be complemented essentially nationally by 1.7 and 2.1 spectrum, which doesn't have the same favorable transmission characteristics, of course, as 700. So what we view AWS-3 long-term deployment in terms for the companies like American Tower is that you're going to have a denser network for 4G at the end of the day to carry the traffic. And so you see that in pieces now with various carriers deploying AWS and other pieces of spectrum, including Sprint, with its 2.5. But as the time goes on, the only way to carry this traffic that we've been describing is going to be with AWS and higher spectrum. The sites are going to ultimately have to be closer together, we think. And that will take time. It will play out over a series of years, but we do think, it will underpin some pretty good U.S. growth for the long term. And then finally, just to mention on Sprint, I believe they're still in the midst of finalizing their network strategy, and once they do that, we'll hear more from them on exactly how they want to go through with that deployment. And again, they're going to be putting in spectrum bands for essentially 4G. They're going to be much, much higher frequency than some they're already using today. And eventually, that bodes for a denser network even for Sprint when they're ready to make those investments. So I think I'll stop there and turn it over to Tom."

Certainly, on the second question relative to small cells, we have about 300 indoor DAS systems. We have just over 30 ODAS systems, over 20,000 rooftop rights that are available for small cell and macro cell activity. Those comprised by 6% of our AMT domestic rental and management revenue. And as I mentioned, we generated just over 30%, excluding the amortization. From a tenancy perspective on the venue-based assets, we're generating -- we have 2.3 tenants per tower or per node. Gross margins in the 75% range versus the ODAS, which as we've said before, is much lower at the 1.1 50% kind of margin levels. But I think strategically, we continue to think that in most areas in the U.S., the macro towers are the optimal transmission points. It's cost -- we believe cost and technology primitive outside of dense urban areas to use small cells to any great degree just because the siting cost need to run 5 at each node, hand off issues and things like that. However, as we said in dense urban areas with population densities of 10,000 per square mile, we think that small cells can make sense, and the key point though is you can make a multitenant model out of it, manage the technology risk and higher cost associated with the ownership of active electronics and fiber at those kinds of levels. Our conclusion as far as [indiscernible] multitenant model where you can earn good long-term economic returns exist, more so in indoor DAS types of installation. And as a result, we've got those 300 indoor DAS systems in the U.S. and another 100 internationally. So our ODAS presence is a lot smaller because we just haven't found the returns there to be as compelling relative to all the investment -- the other investment opportunities that we have. So we continue to participate meaningfully in small cells, but are really careful to make sure that we're investing capital where we can find a multitenant model."

And quarter in, quarter out, there could be some fluctuations on that over the long term. That's exactly what we're striving to do. And there are a number of elements to it. As I've said before, we kind of walk and chew gum at the same time because we're constantly reinvesting our business in terms of acquiring new assets that are providing future opportunities for growth. We look at things on an AFFO per share basis because to the extent that those opportunities don't exist for future investments that don't meet our own internal hurdle requirements, then we'll return that cash back to shareholders and that obviously will take shares out of the market and provide an opportunity to increase AFFO per share that way. But that's -- that is our goal. I mean that we have the opportunity now of being able to invest in many different markets, and so we're not limited to just investing in one market. And so we have a broad array of looking at where we can create the most net present value. And I think we have the engine working. We have a really good machine here in terms of being able to manage to do that process. Our R&D is really in the value that we have in our contracts. That's really where we're able to create the value. We have a -- we have long-term visibility on that because the contracts are so long. So we continue to hone in on our things like SG&A to make sure that we're leveraging that as best as we possibly can. It's the beauty of the model that when you do bring on that incremental dollar revenue, you're -- like we've been able to demonstrate, you're bringing $0.90 of that dollar down to the gross margin line. So that's a wonderful thing that we've been able to do on a global basis. And again it comes to the quality of the assets, but more importantly, even to the quality of the contracts and the quality of the relationship that we have with our customers on a global basis. So that's what we do day in and day out, to try to leverage the portfolios that we have and leverage the assets and the people that we've got in the business to make the right kinds of investment decisions in terms of systems and all those kind of boring operational things that we do behind the curtain to make sure that we really can continue that kind of growth. So long answer saying, that's our plan, that's our goal, and that's what -- that's what we -- Jim and I do and as well as the entire executive team do every day."

So we have an excellent, I think, business relationship with AT&T across the board. There's always things to talk about on contracts and such, but what we've done in the U.S. is determined a way to have mutually beneficial contractual arrangements with AT&T, especially in periods where it's growing its network rapidly. And so we've replicated the same sort of arrangement with AT&T in Mexico, which is again over half of our revenue base in the country. And let me just speak to that a second -- for one more minute, and then I'll turn it over time to Tom to add some more of the data behind it. So we have a unified master lease agreement now with AT&T, covers all of our site leases under the previous [indiscernible] cell agreements and extends all those leases for 14 years, which is a really nice, long time horizon to have a guaranteed revenue stream from all those leases. This agreement also guarantees our company certain levels of new business from AT&T Mexico over the next several years, with some potential upside on top of that, depending on how active they think they need to get in the network. And again, we believe it's going to be mutually beneficial to American Tower and AT&T. And then also specifically, for our customer, provides access of flexibility for them regarding all of our Mexico assets to help efficiently accelerate their network upgrade strategy. We want to be their partner in that. So I also wanted to note that with their acquisition of DirecTV, AT&T is now not only our top 5 new business customer in the U.S. and Mexico, but it's also in the third quarter in the top 5 in Brazil, Colombia and Peru as well. So that's demonstrating the expanding geographic scope of our partnership with that particular company and it's another example of us having global, multitenant, high-level carrier relationships that we can really extend around the world, in some cases, and drive stable revenue growth for the long term, and in this case again, 14-year kind of extension.

It's now we're at double-digit kind of core organic growth. As that market has come out of a period, of a couple of years, where because of some of the -- I think the regulatory environment there has been, as I said before, a little bit sleepy. And so now we're starting to see a pickup of growth in that market as the carriers, as Jim mentioned, are deploying 4G. And I think gets us cautiously optimistic in terms of the growth that we would expect to come from the market to going forward. 90% wireless penetration, only 35% smartphone penetration, 45% 3G and 4G penetration, kind of a $10 to $11 ARPU. I think the LTE investments as we mentioned are still very much in the early stages. CapEx down there is still in the 15% to 20% range, and we believe will be higher, given what we've heard AT&T and América Móvil announced publicly. We believe, like Brazil, that the market needs kind of twice the number of towers to support 4G over the long term. And so as I mentioned, the team has done really nice -- I think really well in terms of managing the portfolio that we've had down there. It's growing significantly. We're building towers for our customers in the marketplace. It's our second largest Latin American market, probably [indiscernible] kind of that $300 million, $350 million range. So it's a sizable market for us, and I think it's really going to contribute nicely to our overall core organic growth over the next several years."

We don't speak to the specific timing of -- in terms of master lease agreements. But in general, just to say, you know the concept that these holistic agreements have a period of years during which there's a lot of flexibility, as I mentioned earlier and what the carrier can do. There are limitations to equipment rights and other limitations within those. But at a certain point, those widely available rights will then revert back to retail model, if you will, which is an individual application for every single thing that the carrier wants to do. And we just go back to business as usual or pre-holistic practice, which is we'll price that application and will individually negotiate it, and we'll end up getting our revenue that way. So the concept is that as long as there is demand, we'll get nice revenue growth from the same customer, whether it's holistic or not. What the holistic does is it reduces any kind of downward risk over a period of time. And there's quite a few years to run on the individual site leases with AT&T well beyond the point where that switchover might happen. And again, so we're not speaking to [indiscernible] the progress in negotiation and exact timing of when these things happen, but that is the general concept.

There are certain elements that Jim talked about that changed over that period of time, but the MLA is not expiring, so I just want to make sure that you understand -- you clearly understood that. Because they also saw that in some writeups, and I just want to be very, very clear on that. With regards to the escalators, about 90% of our revenue on international markets is tied to inflation. And in each of those markets, there are indices, CPI indices, that are used for determining what that inflation would be and how that then would impact the ongoing leases and the revenue stream in those markets. And that happens throughout the year whenever that lease was originally put on the base. So [indiscernible] happen as of January 1. There are some caps, floors, maxis on that. But we think it's a very good way for us to be able to minimize the impacts of that. I'll also mention that we also have similar types of escalators on our land, okay? So it's not just the revenue that we have it on, it's also on the land cost. But just to give you a sense in the -- even in the third quarter, our escalators in our international markets was probably about 4.5%.

One of the things they talked about is diversifying their business, both geographically and also the funding on their balance sheet as far as where they borrow the money. You guys also, obviously, a large global infrastructure leasing provider, diversification. So kind of 2 prongs to the question. One, do you have kind of a target mix of how you'd like to diversify U.S. versus international and where those international baskets might go? And then on the funding side, most of your existing balance sheet is, I think, in U.S. dollar still. Can you update a little bit about your thoughts as far as how funding this diversification, as you, I think, Tom mentioned, continue to investment where it makes financial sense. Just kind of the diversification and funding question."

We have said a number of times in the past, we don't have a specific revenue split target for U.S. versus our international markets. But just as a reference, because of the size, the pricing structures, the strength of the contracts that Tom already mentioned, the U.S. still delivers 75% of the operating income of the company, right? So that's going to be a very big flywheel that itself grows over a long period of time, and there's a smaller flywheel of international operating income that's going to grow faster for a longer period of time. And so those 2 things actually complement each other, and we don't have a specific target of how the math ought to work in, say, year 5 or year 10. But what we will continue to do is look both in the U.S. and outside for investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria, right, which is meaningful AFFO per share, growth opportunity at asset prices that give us a good opportunity to also keep ROIC stable and rising over time as well, okay? That's how we make those investment decisions. The benefit of having the global aperture as we look at those investment decisions are, it gives us a lot more things to look at. Many of those things will meet our investment criteria, we'll go through them. A couple of those have happened already this year in the case of TIM, Airtel and now Viom. We also had that aperture open in the domestic side, and we made a very significant agreement with Verizon, as everybody knows earlier this year. And then there's a lot of things we don't have to do because we have the wide aperture. There's a couple of other carrier deals that didn't meet our asset pricing objective, and you didn't see us win those. There's many international deals because we have again both sides of the street to play on that we don't take because we don't think we have to take them to grow inorganically. So I think those are the benefits of having the global team in place, the track record, these multinational customer relationships. The diversification will naturally happen, because as you know, 60% of the sites and it will be greater next year, contingent on our Viom closing. But outside of the U.S., we're going to grow faster and longer. So this is going to actually going to evolve over time, but there aren't any targets. Tom?"

That's where we'll allocate our dollars. And as I said, it's largely due to the fact that we can look at everything on a risk-adjusted basis.  And relative to the second question from a funding perspective, we have less than $500 million invested to date. Clearly, our goal where it makes financial sense to raise more capital locally. We will be pro forma for the Viom transaction upwards of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, local country financing, given the fact that $800 million to $900 million of debt on that business is all local currency with local banks, local banks at this point in time. So there will be $1 billion, $1.5 billion of debt invested internationally. And Leah and our entire treasury group continues to looks at opportunities to invest in local markets where it makes sense. So we'll continue to do that, continue to raise cash locally, as well as look at all other kinds of opportunities where we can actually raise capital."

But the incremental level of decommissioning revenue, which is around $15 million, $17 million that we expect to record in '15 may not recur in 2016, Phil. And on the capital raising side around the equity side, we'll be looking to -- once we get through all of the regulatory review in India, this will close in the -- we anticipate in the middle of 2016. And we'll look at that time just in terms of where the margins -- where the EBITDA is, what kind of EBITDA performance we've had in our existing business, where -- a lot of different elements, Phil, to determine what our capital raising plans would do. As you know, the good news is that -- and by the way, as well as the debt balance that we would be assuming with the Viom transaction. So I think at that point in time, we'll have a much clearer notion in terms of where and what the capital structure would look like. We're committed to getting down to that 5x by the year-end 2016. We think we have a lot of products available to us to be able to ensure that.

But as I said -- our customers are investing heavily, as Jim talked to in the marketplace. There definitely is a need to kind of double the amount of sites that are actually in the marketplace. I think the regulators down there are driving that kind of requirement on the carriers themselves. And so we're very bullish in terms of what we would expect. Some of the recent transactions that we've done is giving us more of a metro type of a coverage range.

And the goal of the FirstNet management is to choose not only its partners but its actual structure of operation.

We don't know how this is really going to play out in the [indiscernible] who's going to participate as far as operators, OEMs, other kinds of sort of prime contractors that could get involved. So we're going to keep all our options open and deal across the board with potential teammates as this evolves and with FirstNet, to the extent we can deal with them directly. So there's definitely an opportunity here. There's a need of good -- of better public safety network, a 4G-based one in this country. FirstNet is going to drive that. And we plan, of course, to participate in it, although we can't assess the value of the actual lease stream down the road yet. And then as far as consolidation risk in Brazil, the trade-off for us has always been -- as you pointed out, we need at least 3, we think, well-funded, successful mobile operators in the market to get to optimal long-term outcome for our company. And so whether it's 5, counting Nextel in Brazil today, or 4 or 3, over the 10- to 20-year time horizon, as long as they're funded in a way that they can drive 4G penetration to 100% and then get to that 2, 4, 6 gigabyte a month usage level, it's going to be terrifically constructive for the tower business. Our overlaps in Brazil happen to be really modest. TIM and Oi serve the biggest cycle on the rumor scale, I guess, as far as potential consolidation. And if they were to emerge, just as an example, we don't expect this. But just to give you again context, the overlap on our towers in Brazil is only 1% of consolidated revenues, and we have 8 to 9 years on average left on these contracts. So we don't view industry consolidation in Brazil as a material threat to the business. Certainly, in the mid to long term, it wouldn't affect it, I don't think."

We've posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website.
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our financial and operational performance for the third quarter as well as our full year outlook for 2015; and then Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss recent technology trends, how they will impact the mobile value chain and how our diversified portfolio of assets positions us to drive compelling returns for shareholders well into the future. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding: our 2015 outlook, foreign currency exchange rate and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our future growth, technology industry trends, anticipated closings of acquisitions, anticipated contributions of pending acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in yesterday's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and in our other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligations to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation, which provides a summary of our third quarter 2015 results. During the quarter, our rental and management revenue grew 20% from the third quarter of 2014 to over $1.21 billion. During the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to approximately $779 million, and adjusted funds from operations increased by more than 21% to approximately $558 million. 
During the quarter, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders declined by approximately $124 million to about $76 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted common share. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decline in net income were the one-time $93 million cash tax charge as part of our previously announced GTP REIT tax election and approximately $78 million related to unrealized foreign currency losses, attributable to our intercompany balances. 
Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire a 51% controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. Please note that given the regulatory process associated with the transaction, we will not be in a position to provide detail on our future expectations regarding the acquisition until that process has concluded.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail."

As you can see, we had a solid third quarter from both an organic and inorganic growth perspective. In addition, we continued to add assets in select key markets where we believe the opportunity for long-term sustainable growth is compelling. This includes the acquisition of the nearly 4,700 towers in Nigeria that we closed in July, and the follow-on close of an additional 1,100 sites in Brazil from TIM at the end of September. And as Leah said, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire 51% controlling stake in Viom Networks in India.

And given just a 4% fixed-line penetration in a population of over 1 billion people, predominantly using 2G technology, India is a very attractive market for a tower operator like ourselves. In addition, this transaction is also expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and will help us continue to achieve our aspirational goal of annual double-digit AFFO per share growth over the long term.
If you'll please turn to Slide 6, let's now talk about our quarterly results. Our consolidated rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by 20% to just over $1.2 billion. On a core basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was more than 27%, and of this core growth, over 7% was organic. The balance of our core growth, or approximately 20%, was attributable to properties we've added since the beginning of last year, including over 12,000 sites domestically and about 20,000 sites in our international markets, with over 5,000 of the total sites that we built ourselves. The Verizon, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brazil portfolios comprised the bulk of the inorganic core growth for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Our domestic rental and management segment generated core growth in revenue of about 21% during the third quarter, with organic core growth and revenue of about 6%. On a year-to-date basis, our domestic organic core revenue growth was about 7%. Our annual organic core growth rate continues to benefit from the elevated decommissioning revenues we've recognized in 2015. As we've previously discussed, decommissioning revenues are expected to be around $38 million for 2015, which is higher than the $21 million we received in 2014. And year-to-date, as of the end of the third quarter, we received about $29 million in decommissioning revenues as compared to about $18 million to the same period in 2014. T-Mobile and Verizon drove the majority of our commenced new business in Q3 and continue to comprise the bulk of our new business pipeline. In addition to solid commencement activity, we saw a slight sequential improvement in signed new business during the quarter. Overall, our U.S. business continues to deliver good performance, with organic growth for the year expected to be right in the middle of our long-term target range. In addition, our new Verizon sites are performing in line with our expectations and the integration process is progressing on schedule.
Our domestic rental and management gross margin increased by about 17% on both the reported and core basis to $621 million and reflected a 63% revenue conversion rate. Excluding the Verizon sites, this conversion rate would have been over 90%. In other words, $0.90 of every incremental dollar of organic revenue is falling to the gross margin line.
We also continue to invest in our domestic business, and during the quarter, we constructed 22 towers and added 2 new DAS systems. While our DAS business continues to comprise a small portion of our domestic revenues, it is growing quickly. On a year-to-date basis, for example, revenue from DAS systems grew over 30% over the prior year period, excluding the impacts of any amortization revenue derived from capital contributions.
In addition to investing in new construction in the U.S., we had a record quarter of land management activity, purchasing about 250 parcels and extending ground leases on about 630 of our sites, with the extensions averaging 31 years. Around 62% of the land under our U.S. towers is now either owned or controlled for more than 20 years, and we would expect to get that number up to 80% within the next 5 years.
Reported in core domestic rental and management operating profit growth was about 18%. This reflects strong revenue growth, our continuing focus on property level cost controls and SG&A as a percentage of revenue of under 4%.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our international rental and management segment had a solid quarter, with reported growth of about 17% and core growth of about 44%. Organic core growth and revenue was nearly 11%. All of our international regions continue to deliver strong, organic core growth. We are particularly encouraged by the continuing strong trends in Africa, where organic core growth was once again over 20% in markets like Ghana and Uganda. Reported international revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation effects of about $100 million as compared to the prior year period.
We saw a strong demand in the quarter with markets such as Mexico, Peru and South Africa all generating double-digit sequential growth in signed new business. Large investment-grade tenants like AT&T, Vodafone and Telefónica continue to comprise the majority of our international revenues and organic new business growth. Additionally, although our operating history in Nigeria has only been a few months, performance relative to new business commencements in the market is already exceeding expectations. We also further solidified our international revenue growth visibility by signing a long-term master lease agreement with AT&T in Mexico.
In addition, we continue to invest in our existing markets through new tower construction and built over 730 new towers across our international footprint. We added nearly 400 towers for tenants like Bharti and Vodafone in India and had an exceptionally strong quarter of new build activity in Brazil with over 230 new sites constructed, primarily for Vivo and TIM. We also added 9 international DAS systems in the quarter, bringing our international DAS system count to 137 systems. 
International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew nearly 13% to about $240 million. Our reported international operating profit grew nearly 15% to $205 million, and the operating profit margin percentage was about 51%.
Excluding pass-through revenue, our international operating margin expanded over 120 basis points to 72% as compared to the prior year period. Our core growth in international operating profit was 48%.
Turning to Slide 9. On a consolidated basis, reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 17%, with core growth of about 26% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 63%. Excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was about 70%. We've been able to maintain this rate while adding roughly 30,000 towers with an average tenancy of 1.3 tenants per tower over the last year. Our adjusted EBITDA conversion ratio was approximately 65%, excluding pass-through, or around 90% if you exclude the impacts of adding the new lower-tenancy Verizon, TIM Brazil and Airtel Nigeria assets to the base.
Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was under 8%. And for the full year, we expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be just over 8% versus the 9% and 10% rates of 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Longer term, we expect this annual percentage to continue to decline further as we leverage our existing SG&A base while driving organic growth.
Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased over 21% to $558 million or $1.31 per share. Core AFFO growth was nearly 33%, and our adjusted EBITDA-to-AFFO conversion ratio during the quarter was just under 87%.
Moving on to Slide 10. We are revising our 2015 rental and management segment revenue outlook to $4.65 billion at the midpoint, which reflects additional foreign currency translation effects of about $56 million relative to our prior outlook due to the strengthening dollar, which will be largely offset by organic outperformance of our legacy international assets of around $5 million; additional straight line revenue of about $16 million, principally due to our newly executed master lease agreement in Mexico with AT&T; additional pass-through revenue of about $10 million versus our prior outlook; and about $5 million in additional revenue from the 1,125 TIM Brazil sites we closed on September 30.
For the year, we expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of around 23%. This includes organic core growth expectations of about 7% and nearly 11% for our domestic and international segments, respectively, resulting in a consolidated annual organic core growth rate of 8%.
Moving forward, we expect our international markets to benefit from rising escalators attributable to higher inflation measures in the local markets, which should help support international organic core growth and provide some additional insulation from foreign exchange translation effects.
Despite slightly lowered revenue expectations due to the strengthening dollar, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook midpoint by $5 million to $3.05 billion. This reflects both the strong revenue growth of our core business and ongoing cost management, which are more than offsetting the increased unfavorable FX impact to adjusted EBITDA of about $30 million relative to our prior outlook. We now expect core growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be over 22%, which is about 90 basis points higher than our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 11. We're also raising our full year AFFO outlook by $10 million to $2.13 billion at the midpoint. This is being driven by around $23 million in incremental cash EBITDA from our sites, about $9 million in reduced maintenance and corporate CapEx and $5 million in reduced cash interest. This is being partially offset by an incremental $27 million in negative foreign currency translation effects versus our prior AFFO outlook. Our AFFO growth is now expected to be over 17% for the year or about 27% on a core basis. We expect our AFFO per share growth at the midpoint to be nearly 11% or almost 20% on a core basis. Consequently, we now expect to generate over $5 per share of AFFO for the full year.
Moving on to Slide 12. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, which we believe will support our business in generating consistently strong growth across a variety of business and economic cycles. We are focused on simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
So far this year, we've committed nearly $9 billion to our M&A program, including our pending Viom transaction; declared about $620 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends; and deployed over $500 million in CapEx. About 40% of our annual CapEx spend is for the construction of an expected 3,000 new build-to-suit sites based on the midpoint of our outlook. Year to date, we've completed the construction of over 2,300 sites and have generated a first year return on investment of over 9% on the sites on a consolidated basis. 
We believe that the combination of our growth in AFFO per share and our REIT distribution will create meaningful value for our stockholders. This includes expected annual growth in the REIT distribution of at least 20%, which has actually been 30% or so over the last 12 months. Our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO is currently about 35% and is expected to grow to between 40% and 50% within the next few years due to anticipated growth in our taxable income and the reduction of our net operating loss carryforwards. We also seek to maintain a substantial base of liquidity and add about $2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity under our revolvers as of the end of the quarter. 
From a capital markets' perspective, our focus for the remainder of the year will be to opportunistically extend duration and ladder, out our maturities, which today have an average remaining term of nearly 6 years, with an average interest cost of about 3.4%. We took steps towards obtaining these goals just this week, as we extended the maturity dates of our credit facilities and term loan. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and expect to end 2015 with net leverage in the mid-5x range. Additionally, we expect to be at 5x or below by the end of 2016, including the impact of our recently announced Viom transaction. We expect to evaluate a variety of financing options for this transaction and our other funding needs in keeping with our commitment to investment grade while maximizing the value for our equity holders. 
Our long-term target leverage range continues to be between 3 and 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And over the long term, we intend to utilize our solid financial platform to continue to invest in global, multi-tenant commercial real estate assets where it makes financial sense to do so. And if those opportunities aren't available, return that generated cash back to our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 13. And in summary, our global business has generated core growth above our long-term target for all key metrics so far this year, and we believe we are well positioned to finish the year strong. Our high-quality asset base, strong balance sheet and manageable leverage positions us well to continue to invest in future growth with our recently announced Viom transaction as a prime example. This transaction will significantly increase our presence in a key global market, increase our portfolio's exposure to India's densely populated areas and enhance our role in the government's Digital India initiative. This is an exciting time to further increase our presence in India, as the market appears to be at a significant inflection point in terms of wireless network investment, and we are excited to help our customers further enhance their wireless networks in the market. Trends across the rest of the markets in our diversified global footprint continue to be favorable as well, with consumer demand for mobile data increasing at a tremendous pace. Including the impact of Viom, we now have a strong presence in the 4 largest, most strategic markets across the continents we serve.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim?"

As we do every year on our third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on the fundamental trends in wireless usage and technology, which we believe, will continue to drive network investment and long-term growth for American Tower.
So let's begin with U.S. mobile data usage, trends and projections as illustrated on Slide 15. The monthly mobile data usage per subscriber on smartphones, laptops and especially tablets is projected to increase significantly, as people seek to mobilize more and more aspects of their daily routine. We believe this growth in mobile data traffic is principally a result of a virtuous cycle. 
First, after years of significant investment, mobile networks today are more capable than ever at delivering the necessary speeds to support high-bandwidth data and entertainment applications. Second, mobile device, processor, battery, software and screen improvements are facilitating increased mobile app navigation, music and video consumption. For example, leading-edge new LTE devices like the iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S6, continue to expand the scope of what we can do on a mobile handset. And whether it's a simple phone call, listening to your favorite music streaming service or getting turn-by-turn directions while driving in your car, a strong, continuous mobile phone signal is becoming ever more essential. As a result, current projections are for the average U.S. smartphone to consume more than 7.5 gigabytes per month in mobile data by 2019, up from around just 2 gigabytes today.
An even greater increase in average usage is projected for network-connected tablets, which are expected to consume nearly double the amount of an average smartphone by 2019. Whether it's streaming an NFL game on 4G at the airport or entertaining your kids with an iPad on a long road trip, mobile video connectivity is becoming more mainstream. This transformation is being fueled by the wire-to-mobile conversion of social media and branded-video content, especially by over-the-top providers such as Netflix.
The cumulative impact of these usage trends is shown on Slide 16. After nearly quadrupling in the last 3 years, total U.S. mobile data usage is expected to more than quadruple again by 2019. Since the early part of the 2000s, carriers have invested nearly $350 billion in wireless CapEx, as illustrated by the gray shading on Slide 17. They're using this cash to build out their nationwide mobile networks to support the fixed-to-mobile conversion of first telephony, then Internet services, and most recently, social media and entertainment. Each new generation of technology has in turn resulted in explosive growth of traffic on those enhanced networks and then a subsequent step function increase in network investment levels completing the virtuous cycle.
There are 2 facets of mobile network investment, which are depicted on the next slide. The first is known as the core side of the network. The fixed-line portion of the system, which consists of the switches, servers and related electronics; the fiberoptic cable and copper that connects all these major components together; and the software that makes it all work. The other side of the network is known as the RAN, or radio access network, and is made up of the widely distributed transmission or cell sites. Each cell then utilizes an airlink over radio spectrum to reach your device over the air. At American Tower, we play only on the RAN side of the network, and demand for our real estate goes up directly whenever more transmission equipment, such as antennas, is required for capacity or when new cell locations are needed for coverage. Moreover, our demand goes up indirectly when improvements in the core network reduce its cost of operation, potentially freeing up more capital and/or OpEx resources for the RAN and its many cell sites. Therefore, it's crucial to view technology and industry developments as they relate to American Tower by asking 3 simple questions about each. First, does this particular technology significantly improve airlink capacity, and thus reduce the need for equipment on towers? Second, does this technology significantly increase the distance a high-quality wireless signal can travel, allowing sites to be positioned further apart? And third, conversely, does this technology reduce core network costs, which then would enable more resources to be deployed back into the RAN?
So now I'll spend a few minutes on several emerging technologies which we believe are or will be incorporated into future mobile network deployments and address those 3 critical questions for each.
First, let's start with self-optimizing networks or SONs and software-defined networks or SDNs. SONs allow networks to be more intelligent by dynamically managing traffic. This helps carriers reduce expensive truck rolls to make physical network equipment adjustments in the field. Meanwhile, SDNs provide carriers with a tool to add new network functionality and services through simple software upgrades, dramatically reducing time and cost. Both the SON and SDN therefore primarily enhance the efficiency of the core side of carrier networks and help operators reduce OpEx and CapEx there. So we view both of these technologies as neutral to positive for tower demand.
Next, let's address cloud RAN or C-RAN technology, which enables carriers to centralize the base stations of several cell sites at a data center, instead of having dedicated ground-based equipment at each tower site. As a result, the carriers are able to reduce their base station costs and enhance the processing efficiency of the mobile core portion of their networks. While their ground space requirements at the base of towers can decrease with C-RAN in use, the amount of equipment on the towers themselves is unaffected, or in some cases, actually increases, as remote radio heads are installed on the tower. So for a tower operator, we also expect C-RAN to be typically neutral to net positive.
As you can see on Slide 19, it is our understanding that none of the technologies I just mentioned materially enhance airlink capacity or extend effective signal ratings. Conversely, when it comes to whether or not these innovations have the capability to decrease carrier operating expense on the core side of the network, the answer is yes. Over the long term, they should be a positive for the tower industry.
Turning to the airlink side of the network. There have been technological improvements which over time have improved network capacity. For example, carrier aggregation has enabled mobile operators to deploy unpaired spectrum usually with high and low bands together all on one site. This adds network capacity in the short term as spectrum assets are more effectively utilized. But in the long term, we believe this will actually lead to increased cell site densification as the design requirements of the highest frequency band spectrum will dictate ultimate network density and overall design requirements. Our estimate is that over the last few years, capacity gains from new spectrum and higher spectral efficiency of LTE has absorbed roughly 20% to 30% of incremental network usage, leaving the 70% to 80% being solved through additional cell sites and equipment on our towers. As I have highlighted in past calls, the laws of physics govern the properties of RF signal propagation and thereby limit the impact that many changes in technology can have to the airlink portion of a mobile network. For example, in the largely suburban and rural areas served by our U.S. towers, antenna elevations of at least 75 feet above ground level are usually needed for effective signal transmission. And antennas that are upwards of 10-feet tall also continue to be required for the specific spectrum bands being used and the cell radius being served in these topologies. In addition, higher bandwidth data traffic requires more signal propagation locations to ensure sufficient signal strength and more equipment at those locations to process that signal as well. And these trends drive solid core organic growth that you've seen in our business year after year. Given the topographic and demographic characteristics of the United States and our international markets, we continue to expect the macro tower to be the predominant siting solution for carrier network deployments now and in the future.
Additionally, the improvement of technology in the mobile core should enable the carriers to deploy relatively more capital on their radio access network build-outs to keep up with the demand. This may be especially relevant with the much higher throughput expected on future 5G networks and beyond. Moreover, our international operations continue to benefit from the increasing availability of cheaper, more advanced smartphones and the greater ability of many more people around the world to afford them. Mobile connectivity is revolutionizing communications, commerce and entertainment in the developing world, and we think that in many of our served markets, the modernization cycle is actually accelerating.
As you can see on Slide 20, we are positioned internationally with a diverse portfolio of assets in markets where the rate of growth in mobile data traffic is likely to outpace even that of the U.S.  An excellent example of this phenomenon is in India, which will be our largest international market pro forma for the close of our recently announced Viom transaction. The wireless sector in India is roughly in the same stage as the U.S. was in around 2005, with smartphone penetration of less than 25% and the vast majority of the population still on 2G technology. Like what occurred in the U.S., a fundamental shift towards more advanced wireless technology is now underway in India, with the major carriers announcing significant network build plans for 3G and even the initial rollout of 4G, beginning in key urban metros where Viom is especially well positioned.
Another compelling example of a market that's still early in the wireless technology curve is Nigeria. Similar to India, there's virtually no fixed-line infrastructure in place there. The large, predominantly young population of more than 170 million people has embraced wireless, but more than 80% of the devices being used in Nigeria are still on 2G. Cheaper, more advanced handsets are expected to drive significant growth in mobile data traffic and carriers there are making significant investments in their networks to capitalize on this shift. Taken together, we expect our diverse and substantial international assets to deliver growth that would be stronger for longer than even in the U.S.
And given the consumer and industry trends in the U.S. and across our global footprint, we do expect to continue to deliver strong, long-term growth in AFFO and very attractive total returns for our shareholders.

U.S. applications, as Tom said, are up slightly from the second to third quarter of this year. And I can give you a quick run-through of where we see the demand coming from, largely based, frankly, on the public statements of the carriers, but we can give you a little more color on some of it. Our largest new business customers over the last couple of quarters have been Verizon and T-Mobile, sort of running neck and neck in a way over the last 6 months, I'd say. And T-Mobile, in the field, we see them deploying aggressively their 700-megahertz A block spectrum. That's going to give them a stronger signal in places they don't have it. They're also doing a roaming overbuild, which continues because of the success of their subscriber additions. They can actually make the decisions to put network equipment in place in more territories across the United States, and they're doing that. So T-Mobile is being pretty aggressive this year. Verizon is pretty stable and steady. Their wireless CapEx is up almost 20% year-to-date from 2014. They guided, I think, to $8.6 billion for mobile spending for CapEx in 2015. They're aggressively deploying AWS spectrum across their markets to handle the data demand that they're seeing from their customer base and again on a pretty stable sort of spending and deployment schedule in our estimation. AT&T continues to be grooming, I guess we call it. They were our biggest customer for new business from late 2013 to mid-2014. And they've taken the intervening year or so to groom that investment, to make sure that it's effectively being utilized for its subscriber base. They're guiding -- as everybody I think knows, a little bit less from year-to-year CapEx spending. They're at $6.6 billion. So just as a reference, if Verizon is at $8.6 billion in 2015 and AT&T is at $6.6 billion, how does that feature comparison or trend play out? I think everybody could sort of drive their own conclusions on that, but we do expect AT&T to continue to be competitive over the next few years on the network side of the business. They are also going to be looking at deploying as Verizon AWS-3, once that gets kind of cleared and available. What's interesting to us about AWS-3 and especially the fact that Verizon and AT&T spent collectively almost $20 billion for that spectrum is that it means that the fundamental 4G network, which is based on 700-megahertz spectrum today, is going to be complemented essentially nationally by 1.7 and 2.1 spectrum, which doesn't have the same favorable transmission characteristics, of course, as 700. So what we view AWS-3 long-term deployment in terms for the companies like American Tower is that you're going to have a denser network for 4G at the end of the day to carry the traffic. And so you see that in pieces now with various carriers deploying AWS and other pieces of spectrum, including Sprint, with its 2.5. But as the time goes on, the only way to carry this traffic that we've been describing is going to be with AWS and higher spectrum. The sites are going to ultimately have to be closer together, we think. And that will take time. It will play out over a series of years, but we do think it will underpin some pretty good U.S. growth for the long term. And then finally, just to make mention on Sprint, I believe they're still in the midst of finalizing their network strategy, and once they do that, we'll hear more from them on exactly how they want to go through with that deployment. And again, they're going to be putting in spectrum bands for essentially 4G. They're going to be at a much, much higher frequency than some they're already using today. And eventually, that bodes for a denser network even for Sprint when they're ready to make those investments. So I think I'll stop there and turn it over to Tom."

Sure, on the second question relative to small cells, we have about 300 indoor DAS systems. We have just over 30 ODAS systems, over 20,000 rooftop rights that are available for small cell and macro cell activity. Those comprised about 6% of our AMT domestic rental and management revenue. And as I mentioned, we generated just over 30%, excluding the amortization. From a tenancy perspective on the venue-based assets, we're generating -- we have 2.3 tenants per tower or per node. Gross margins in the 75% range versus the ODAS, which as we've said before, is much lower at the 1.1 50% kind of margin levels. But I think strategically, we continue to think that in most areas in the U.S., the macro towers are the optimal transmission points. It's cost -- we believe cost and technology are prohibitive outside of dense urban areas to use small cells to any great degree just because the siting costs need to run fiber at each node, hand off issues and things like that. However, as we said in dense urban areas with population densities of 10,000 per square mile, we think that small cells can make sense, and the key point though is you can make a multi-tenant model out of it and manage the technology risk and higher costs associated with the ownership of active electronics and fiber at those kinds of levels. Our conclusion thus far has been that multi-tenant model where you can earn good long-term economic returns exist, more so in indoor DAS types of installation. And as a result, we've got those 300 indoor DAS systems in the U.S. and another 100 internationally. So our ODAS presence is a lot smaller because we just haven't found the returns there to be as compelling relative to all the investment -- the other investment opportunities that we have. So we continue to participate meaningfully in small cells, but are really careful to make sure that we're investing capital where we can find a multi-tenant model."

And quarter in, quarter out, there could be some fluctuations on that over the long term. That's exactly what we're striving to do. And there are a number of elements to it. As I've said before, we kind of walk and chew gum at the same time because we're constantly reinvesting our business in terms of acquiring new assets that are providing future opportunities for growth. We look at things on an AFFO per share basis because to the extent that those opportunities don't exist for future investments that don't meet our own internal hurdle requirements, then we'll return that cash back to shareholders and that obviously will take shares out of the market and provide an opportunity to increase AFFO per share that way. But that's -- that is our goal. I mean that we have the opportunity now of being able to invest in many different markets, and so we're not limited to just investing in one market. And so we have a broad array of looking at where we can create the most net present value. And I think we have the engine working. We have a really good machine here in terms of being able to manage through that process. Our R&D is really in the value that we have in our contracts. That's really where we're able to create the value. We have a -- we have long-term visibility on that because the contracts are so long. So we continue to hone in on our -- things like SG&A to make sure that we're leveraging that as best as we possibly can. It's the beauty of the model that when you do bring on that incremental dollar revenue, you're -- like we've been able to demonstrate, you're bringing $0.90 of that dollar down to the gross margin line. So that's a wonderful thing that we've been able to do on a global basis. And again it comes to the quality of the assets, but more importantly, even to the quality of the contracts and the quality of the relationships that we have with our customers on a global basis. So that's what we do day in and day out, to try to leverage the portfolios that we have and leverage the assets and the people that we've got in the business to make the right kinds of investment decisions in terms of systems and all those kind of boring operational things that we do behind the curtain to make sure that we really can continue that kind of growth. So long answer saying, that's our plan, that's our goal, and that's what -- that's what we -- Jim and I do and as well as the entire executive team do every day."

But we do want to keep our investment-grade rating along the way because we've done our own regression analysis to say when capital markets are tight, asset prices are lowest and we can get access to capital and other people can't. That's where we make some of our best long-term transactions. So we're going to try to keep demonstrating the stability of the business and maybe get a little more headroom from the rating agencies and others in the market.

First of all, it's important to point out that AT&T is our biggest customer, not only in the U.S, globally and now also in Mexico. So we have an excellent, I think, business relationship with AT&T across the board. There's always things to talk about on contracts and such, but what we've done in the U.S. is determined a way to have mutually beneficial contractual arrangements with AT&T, especially in periods where it's growing its network rapidly. And so we've replicated the same sort of arrangement with AT&T in Mexico, which is again over 1/2 of our revenue base in the country. And let me just speak to that a second -- for one more minute, and then I'll turn it over time to Tom to add some more of the data behind it. So we have a unified master lease agreement now with AT&T, covers all of our site leases under the previous [indiscernible] Cell and Nextel agreements and extends all those leases for 14 years, which is a really nice, long time horizon to have a guaranteed revenue stream from all those leases. This agreement also guarantees our company certain levels of new business from AT&T Mexico over the next several years, with some potential upside on top of that, depending on how active they think they need to get in the network. And again, we believe it's going to be mutually beneficial to American Tower and AT&T. And then also specifically, for our customer, provides access and flexibility for them regarding all of our Mexico assets to help efficiently accelerate their network upgrade strategy. We want to be their partner in that. So I also wanted to note that with their acquisition of DirecTV, AT&T is now not only our top 5 new business customer in the U.S. and Mexico, but it's also in the third quarter in the top 5 in Brazil, Colombia and Peru as well. So that's demonstrating the expanding geographic scope of our partnership with that particular company and it's another example of us having global, multi-tenant, high-level carrier relationships that we can really extend around the world, in some cases, and drive stable revenue growth for the long term, and in this case again, 14-year kind of extension.

Telefonica represents about 20%, 21%; AT&T, up in the 60% level. As we've mentioned in the past, the organic core growth has picked up nicely. It's now -- we're at a double-digit kind of core organic growth. As that market has come out of a period of a couple of years, where because of some of the -- I think the regulatory environment there has been, as I said before, a little bit sleepy. And so now we're starting to see a pickup of growth in that market as the carriers, as Jim mentioned, are deploying 4G and I think gets us cautiously optimistic in terms of the growth that we would expect to come from that market to going forward. Ninety percent wireless penetration, only 35% smartphone penetration, 45% 3G and 4G penetration, kind of a $10 to $11 ARPU. I think the LTE investments as we mentioned are still very much in the early stages. CapEx down there is still in the 15% to 20% range, and we believe will be higher, given what we've heard AT&T and América Móvil announced publicly. We believe, like Brazil, that the market needs kind of twice the number of towers to support 4G over the long term. And so as I mentioned, the team's done really nice -- I think really well in terms of managing the portfolio that we've had down there. It's growing significantly. We're building towers for our customers in the marketplace. It's our second largest Latin American market, probably resides [ph] around the kind of that $300 million, $350 million range. So it's a sizable market for us, and I think it's really going to contribute nicely to our overall core organic growth over the next several years."

And I guess my question is, if you don't renew that MLA with them as you go into 2016, what's the potential impact on the revenue to which you recognize from them without that MLA? The second question is on international escalators. Can you just remind us what percentage of your international escalators are tied to CPI-type benchmarks? What that average rate's been in 2015?

We don't speak to the specific timing of -- in terms of master lease agreements. But in general, just to say, you know the concept that these holistic agreements have a period of years during which there's a lot of flexibility, as I mentioned earlier and what the carrier can do. There are limitations to equipment rights and other limitations within those. But at a certain point, those widely available rights will then revert back to retail model, if you will, which is an individual application for every single thing that the carrier wants to do. And we just go back to business as usual or pre-holistic practice, which is we'll price that application and we'll individually negotiate it and we'll end up getting our revenue that way. So the concept is that as long as there is demand, we'll get nice revenue growth from the same customer, whether it's holistic or not. What the holistic does is reduces any kind of downward risk over a period of time. And there's quite a few years to run on the individual site leases with AT&T well beyond the point where that switchover might happen. And again, so we're not speaking to the progress in negotiation and exact timing of when these things happen, but that is the general concept. And I think that AT&T is going to, again, be competitive in the U.S. market. It's one of their -- it's not their core business, one of their top core businesses in the corporation. And we expect them to be trying to capture as much of that rising demand for data as they can within their financial plan."

Let me be really clear. The master lease agreement is not expiring, okay? There are certain elements that Jim talked about that change over that period of time, but the MLA is not expiring, so I just want to make sure that you understand -- you clearly understood that. Because I also saw that in some write-ups, and I just wanted to be very, very clear on that. With regards to the escalators, about 90% of our revenue on international markets is tied to inflation. And in each of those markets, there are indices, CPI indices, that are used for determining what that inflation would be and how that then would impact the ongoing leases and the revenue stream in those markets. And that happens throughout the year whenever that lease was originally put on the base. So it won't all happen as of January 1. There are some caps, floors, maxis on that. But we think it's a very good way for us to be able to minimize the impacts of that. I'll also mention that we also have similar types of escalators on our land, okay? So it's not just the revenue that we have it on. It's also on the land cost. But just to give you a sense in the -- even in the third quarter, our escalators in our international markets was probably about 4.5%. So it clearly provides some benefits, and we would expect, given the levels of inflation over the -- that we've seen over the last 18 months -- 12 to 18 months, that we would start to see some of that benefit as we have in queue -- in 2015, but I think we'll see even probably a higher level of impact in 2016."

We have said a number of times in the past, we don't have a specific revenue split target for U.S. versus our international markets. But just as a reference, because of the size, the pricing structures, the strength of the contracts that Tom already mentioned, the U.S. still delivers 75% of the operating income of the company, right? So that's going to be a very big flywheel that itself grows over a long period of time and there's a smaller flywheel of international operating income that's going to grow faster for a longer period of time. And so those 2 things actually complement each other and we don't have a specific target of how the math ought to work in, say, year 5 or year 10. But what we will continue to do is look both in the U.S. and outside for investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria, right, which is meaningful AFFO per share, growth opportunity at asset prices that give us a good opportunity to also keep ROIC stable and rising over time as well, okay? That's how we make those investment decisions. The benefit of having the global aperture as we look at those investment decisions are, it gives us a lot more things to look at. Many of those things will meet our investment criteria. We'll go through them. A couple of those have happened already this year in the case of TIM, Airtel and now Viom. We also had that aperture open in the domestic side and we made a very significant agreement with Verizon, as everybody knows, earlier this year. And then there's a lot of things we don't have to do because we have the wide aperture. There's a couple of other carrier deals that didn't meet our asset pricing objective, and you didn't see us win those. There's many international deals because we have again both sides of the street to play on that we don't take because we don't think we have to take them to grow inorganically. So I think those are the benefits of having the global team in place, the track record, these multinational customer relationships. The diversification will naturally happen, because as you know, 60% of the sites and it will be greater next year, contingent on our Viom closing. Or outside of the U.S. and they're going to grow faster and longer. So this is naturally going to evolve over time, but there aren't any targets. Tom?"

That's where we'll allocate our dollars. And as I said, it's largely due to the fact that we can look at everything on a risk-adjusted basis.  And relative to the second question from a funding perspective, we have less than $500 million invested today. Clearly, our goal where it makes financial sense to raise more capital locally. We will be pro forma for the Viom transaction upwards of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, local country financing, given the fact that $800 million to $900 million of debt on that business is all local currency with local banks, local banks at this point in time. So there will be $1 billion, $1.5 billion of debt invested internationally. And Leah and our entire treasury group continues to looks at opportunities to invest in local markets where it makes sense.

As we previously said, we would still expect to record $20 million, $22 million in revenue under a multi-year agreement that we have in place with one of our carriers. But the incremental level of decommissioning revenue, which is around $15 million, $17 million that we expect to record in '15 may not recur in 2016, Phil. And on the capital raising side around the equity side, we'll be looking to -- once we get through all of the regulatory review in India, this will close in the -- we anticipate in the middle of 2016. And we'll look at that time just in terms of where the margins -- where the EBITDA is, what kind of EBITDA performance we've had in our existing business, where -- a lot of different elements, Phil, to determine what our capital raising plans would do. As you know, the good news is that -- and by the way, as well as the debt balance that we would be assuming with the Viom transaction. So I think at that point in time, we'll have a much clearer notion in terms of where and what the capital structure would look like. We're committed to getting down to that 5x by the year-end 2016. We think we have a lot of products available to us to be able to ensure that. And we're really excited about the opportunities with that Viom transaction and where the EBITDA levels may be, as well as where the EBITDA levels are going to be in our existing business. So a long way of saying, we'll have a much better sense, I think, as we go into 2016 in terms of what that structure might look like."

Now it's going to take months, and in some cases, a number of quarters to get those applications through. It's a mix of co-locations and amendments. It's all kinds of activity there. It will play out over literally the next 6 to 12 months as far as real revenue opportunities that flow from those many applications. But we already have commenced new business in process where we think we'll end the year with about $800,000 a month of incremental monthly revenue based on the new applications we will have processed by then. So that's a really great start. It's in line with our business plan, and we've got a huge pipeline of applications as we've kind of opened up these towers for business, so to speak. Tom?"

It's down a little bit this year and more in the 13% to 14% range, which would -- I would hope would be more -- probably more of a typical kind of run rate going forward. But as I said -- our customers are investing heavily, as Jim talked to in the marketplace. There definitely is a need to kind of double the amount of sites that are actually in the marketplace. I think the regulators down there are driving that kind of requirement on the carriers themselves. And so we're very bullish in terms of what we would expect. Some of the recent transactions that we've done is giving us more of a metro type of a coverage range. So we would hope that, that would help even stimulate some additional capital and organic growth on our portfolio."

As far as FirstNet, there's definitely progress on schedule and RFPs as being put together. There's going to be upwards of a 6-month review process. And the goal of the FirstNet management is to choose not only its partners but its actual structure of operation. And it's going to be something that we're going to participate in as closely as we can. We don't know how this is really going to play out in the end yet, who's going to participate as far as operators, OEMs, other kinds of sort of prime contractors that could get involved. So we're going to keep all our options open and deal across the board with potential teammates as this evolves and with FirstNet, to the extent we can deal with them directly. So there's definitely an opportunity here. There's a need of good -- of better public safety network, a 4G-based one in this country. FirstNet's going to drive that. And we plan, of course, to participate in, although we can't assess the value of the actual lease stream down the road yet. And then as far as consolidation risk in Brazil, the trade-off for us has always been -- as you pointed out, we need at least 3, we think, well-funded, successful mobile operators in the market to get the optimal long-term outcome for our company. And so whether it's 5, counting Nextel in Brazil today, or 4 or 3, over the 10- to 20-year time horizon, as long as they're funded in a way that they can drive 4G penetration to 100% and then get to that 2, 4, 6 gigabyte a month usage level. It's going to be terrifically constructive for the tower business. Our overlaps in Brazil happen to be really modest. TIM and Oi are sort of the biggest cycle on the rumor scale, I guess, as far as potential consolidation. And if they were to merge, just as an example, we don't expect this. But just to give you again context, the overlap on our towers in Brazil is only 1% of consolidated revenues, and we have 8 to 9 years on average left on these contracts. So we don't view industry consolidation in Brazil as a material threat to the business. Certainly, in the mid to long term, it wouldn't affect it, I don't think."
