Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your flexibility with the revised date for our call, which was necessary in order to work through the accounting impact of amending our agreement to sell the coal company. We were in discussions with the purchaser and it became clear that a revision to the selling price is necessary, and since the appropriate accounting were to reflect that impact in the fourth quarter, we rescheduled the call in order to make the required changes to our financial statements.
Today, I'll cover our financial results what we're seeing in the Florida and New Mexico economy, the sales of TECO Coal and 2015 guidance as well as the longer-term outlook. As usual, the appendix to discuss presentation contains graph on the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations with non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $45 million or $0.19 per share compared with $0.18 last year. GAAP net income was $10.8 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations for $16.6 million reflecting impairment charges of $11.6 million and the operating results of TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations were $27.4 million in 2014 and includes $17.6 million of charges consisting of transaction and integration costs of $3 million related to the New Mexico gas acquisition and the $13.6 million adjustment to deferred state income taxes related in the appendix sale of TECO Coal. Excluding these items to non-GAAP results for continuing operations where $0.19 per share.
For the full year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $1.03 per share, 11% higher than 2013's $0.91. GAAP net income of $130.4 million or $0.58 includes a loss in discontinued operations of $76 million, which largely reflect value impairments at TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations was $206.4 million or $0.92 and includes $23.3 million of charges and net tax adjustments related to acquisition and sale activities. Excluding these items yields a non-GAAP result of $229.7 million or $1.03 per share.
Tampa Electric reported slightly lower net income in the fourth quarter. While customer growth was a strong 1.6% and we have a 1 additional month of higher revenues from the 2013 rate settlement, energy sales were lower due to milder weather resulting in fourth quarter revenues in 2014 about the same as the prior year. AFUDC increased this quarter with higher investment balances and the full conversion project and the related water project and O&M expense was lower. The quarter-over-quarter increase in depreciation expense represented more than just the normal increase from additions of facility. That's because in 2013, fourth quarter depreciation had included a benefit of a full 12 months of lower amortization costs to retroactively reflect the change in software lights agreed to the November 2013 rate case settlement.
Weather patterns resulted in retail net energy for load in the fourth quarter that was 2.8% below 2013. Looking at the grid day, which  was 10% below normal and 12% below last year, you might expect energy sales to be all worse than they were even with the customer we saw. In Tampa, we actually have both heating and cooling degree days in the fourth quarter. In this quarter, heating degree days were about normal and cooling degree days were well below normal and that combination produced a milder impact on energy usage than the 10% and 12% degree date very being and those would suggest.
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, which was higher than our full-year expectation. That was due to robust growth in several of the Southwest Florida market that had been the most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as substantial growth in Northeast Florida. We saw higher term sales to all customer segment: Residential, commercial and industrial as a result of the periods of cold weather in the quarter, as well as continued economic growth.
On the expense side, O&M was lower in 2014 while depreciation was up. New Mexico Gas' fourth quarter results benefited from customer growth and the start of the winter heating season even though it was actually milder than normal and milder than 2013. New Mexico Gas is much more seasonal than Peoples Gas in the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.03 to the accretion to our consolidated fourth quarter earnings.
The other net segment is what we used to refer to as Other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the fourth quarter compared to last year driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, which is apparent of New Mexico Gas Company, and the longer allocated to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operation.
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide unemployment at the end of the fourth quarter was 5.6%, an improvement of 7/10 from a year ago. At the same time, the state have added more than 233,000 new jobs over the past year with the largest number of new jobs occurring in business services, trade, transport and utility facility and leisure and hospitality. With this percentage gain occurred again this quarter in the construction sector, which has closed at 8% to 10% employment gain every quarter this year.
Sales for accounting, Tampa Electric's primary service territory also continues to do well. We appeared to be back to the pattern that was normal before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than vote the state in natural level. That employment rates in local areas is down to 5.2%, 6/10 below where it was a year ago and it is not a function of people leaving the workforce as workforce grew by 0.5% in the same timeframe. Over the past year, the Tampa, St. Peter area added more than 14,000 jobs with the largest gains in business services followed by trade transport and utilities.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and large presence of governmental facilities in the state, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the level we saw in Florida, where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the healthy market crash. The largest gain in New Mexico is 2014 job growth of 13,000, came in trade transport and utilities and education and health services.
To put some perspective on the job numbers here, it's interesting to note that the population of New Mexico at about 2.1 million was actually less than the population of the Tampa state, TMSA, which has a population of about 2.8 million. Taxable sale both in Florida and county continue to grow the strong case we've seen pretty consistent way over the last 4 years. We don't have that statistics that in for New Mexico but we have a list found a ready source some more information.
On the housing front, more than 5,000 single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory in 2014 and existing comps continue to sell at a strong pace. The January case show a reports that the selling prices of the Tampa market increased 6.8% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to Tampa sales in the housing remain at a healthy level of 4 months. The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013.
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily all those slowly since the downturn and the housing inventory is about 6 months. You can see all of these trends on a graph in the appendix.
I'm not going to cover all the details of the New Mexico gas acquisition but I do want to point to a few important takeaways. Consistent with the outlook we provided in our third quarter call, the acquisition was accretive to fourth quarter earnings by $0.03, and for the full year, $0.01. You'll recall that it diluted EPS $0.02 in the third quarter as we have the associated shares outstanding in the entire quarter and 1-month of ownership during the typical seasonal loss period.
With our 2015 business plans in place and with the rapid progress implementing our integration plan, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to full year 2015 earnings and that's earlier than we originally anticipated.
Also in October, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to Cambrian Coal Corporation pieces of Gary of group energy a central operation coal producer with operations in the same general area as TECO Coal. The sale was contingent upon the purchase or retaining financing. The coal markets have continued for we for several months now and lastly, we amended the agreement to adjust the selling price to reflect market condition and to extend the closing date to March 13. Under the amended agreement, we will receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reach certain levels. The purchase aren't launched financing activities last week after the amendment agreement was executed.
In the third quarter, we classified TECO Coal's operations as discontinued operation and its assets as assets held for sale. At that time, we recorded a noncash impairment charges of $64.8 million after-tax. We recorded additional impairment of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter and a $16.6 million fourth quarter loss in discontinued operations, includes the additional charge and the operating results of TECO Coal. Those operating results were impacted by costs related to preparing the company for the sale such as severance and other employee termination costs. As we've disclosed previously, the actual closing of the sale will trigger an additional liability related charge, which we estimate at $7 million.
Turning to guidance. We expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.08 to $1.11 excluding non-GAAP charges or gain. This is a tighter range that we provided in the past and that's because our business mix is now augment related utilities. And while weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating company have typically been successful responding to weather variations within a reasonably normal branch.
We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of this allowed ROE branch. That's driven by customer growth that we expect would be in line with 2014. Energy sales to resale customers other than soft base, up an estimated 1%. Higher AFUDC as we enter at peak spending year for the full commercial project and an additional $7.5 million of higher base rate that became effective November 1 last year.
On the expense side. Continued investment in the facilities to serve customers will drive higher depreciation and interest costs. While projecting lower O&M expense, however, in part as we realize benefit from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee related expenses including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in planned assets are among the factors contributing to lower expense. And because the acquisition of New Mexico Gas and sale of TECO Coal forces to remeasure pension expense last year that we measurement captured the negative impact of lower discount rates and mortality improvement in 2014.
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above it's allowed midpoint return, which is 10.75%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw last year to continue in 2015 and expect continued interest in vehicle fleet conversion to compressed natural gas as well. Although current gasoline prices are helpful, the economics are still favorable and there are environmental benefits that users like to promote. AT the end of 2014, Peoples Gas had 31 CNG selling stations on its system and the annual volume with the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. We expect that number to grow again in 2015. And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric.
2015 will represent our first gold year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company and as I said, we expected to be accretive in that first full year. And I like to be clear that there's no great did mathematics in that statement as an taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest costs and the shares reissued. We expect customer growth to start the year at about the same level as 2014 and turned out to the course of the year where the growth in terms sales largely in line with customer growth. We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies and we also have the recredit of $2 million in the first 12 months post closing end of $4 million in each subsequent 12-month period, which have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only have 4 months of ownership with New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide show some information in previous years to provide some full year context. The form 2 filed with the New Mexico Commission reported New Mexico Gas Company net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal and $18 million in 2012, when heating degree days were well below normal and higher rates approved by the commission became effective after the January peak loads at already curve.
This slide is just to remind us to show the seasonal earnings pattern we expect from NMGC. They make their money in the cold weather in the first and fourth quarters of fairly normal pattern for a gas LDC that type of the residential. It actually complement our existing our earnings pattern nicely as Tampa Electric strong this quarter so typically the second and third quarters with summer air-conditioning world.
The segment we referred to us other net includes interest at the unrelated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impact and smaller operating company's the only one of the being TECO's pipeline. We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate. Although we won't be allocating any interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the negative impact from that will be offset by the benefit of refinancing a maturing notes series that has a coupon of 6.75%.
I would summarize our longer-term outlook in this way. Our regulated businesses are investing in infrastructure to serve customers and our growing rate base 5% to 7%. Our target is to deliver radical earnings growth with in line with rate base growth. The challenges in 2016, recognizing that Tampa Electric's rate base did heavily influenced by full conversion projects while in additional $110 million of annual revenue will become effective when that project goes into service at the beginning of '17. The base rate increases benefit 2016 as 5 note. Is delivering earnings growth in 2016 will be affected management across the organization.
You can see graphic representation of Tampa Electric's rate base, which shows stepping up significantly in the 17 months full goes to service. The base revenue pattern is very aligned with the rate base growth you see here. The 2013 rate settlement provided additional base revenues of $57.5 million effective November 1, 2013, which coincided with 2014 rate base growth, $7.5 million at November 1, 2014, $5 million at the same date in '15 and about $110 million in all service information in '17. This graph shows average rate base and excludes the assets that we earned on separately through the environmental costs recovery clause and the construction work in progress that earns AFUDC above threshold mount that is an improvement in rate base.
As a reference point at the end of September of '13, actual average rate base was $4.1 billion, the environmental assets were about $400 million and that equips was about $200 million.
Also, with our upcoming investor's communications schedule, we expect to file our 10-K at the end of this month and we will be at the UBS and more than fully compensate the following week and at the Barclays conference in Atlanta in the middle of March.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your flexibility with the revised date for our call, which was necessary in order to work through the accounting impact of amending our agreement to sell the coal company. We were in discussions with the purchaser, and it became clear that a revision to the selling price was necessary. And since the appropriate accounting were to reflect that impact in the fourth quarter, we rescheduled the call in order to make the required changes to our financial statements.
Today, I'll cover our financial results, what we're seeing in the Florida and New Mexico economies, the sales of TECO Coal and 2015 guidance as well as the longer-term outlook. As usual, the appendix to this presentation contains graph on the Florida and New Mexico economies, and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $45 million or $0.19 per share compared with $0.18 last year. GAAP net income was $10.8 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations of $16.6 million reflecting impairment charges of $11.6 million and the operating results of TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations were $27.4 million in 2014 and includes $17.6 million of charges, consisting of transaction and integration costs of $3 million related to the New Mexico Gas acquisition and the $14.6 million adjustment to deferred state income taxes related to the pending sale of TECO Coal. Excluding these items the non-GAAP results for continuing operations were $0.19 per share.
For the full year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $1.03 per share, 11% higher than 2013's $0.91. GAAP net income of $130.4 million or $0.58 includes a loss in discontinued operations of $76 million, which largely reflects value impairments at TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations was $206.4 million or $0.92 and includes $23.3 million of charges and net tax adjustments related to acquisition and sale activities. Excluding these items yields the non-GAAP results of $229.7 million or $1.03 per share.
Tampa Electric reported slightly lower net income in the fourth quarter. While customer growth was a strong 1.6% and we have 1 additional month of higher revenues from a 2013 rate settlement, energy sales were lower due to milder weather resulting in fourth quarter revenues in 2014 about the same as the prior year. 
AFUDC increased this quarter with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and the related water project; and O&M expense was lower. The quarter-over-quarter increase in depreciation expense represented more than just the normal increase from additions to facility. That's because in 2013, fourth quarter depreciation had included the benefit of a full 12 months of lower amortization costs to retroactively reflect the change in software life agreed to a November 2013 rate case settlement.
Weather patterns resulted in retail net energy per load in the fourth quarter that was 2.8% below 2013. Looking at degree days, which were 10% below normal and 12% below last year, you might expect energy sales to be off more than they were even with the customer growth we saw. In Tampa, we actually have both heating and cooling degree days in the fourth quarter. In this quarter, heating degree days were about normal and cooling degree days were well below normal, and that combination produced a milder impact on energy usage than the 10% and 12% degree days variances would suggest.
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, which was higher than our full year estimates. That was due to robust growth in several of the southwest Florida markets that had been the most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as substantial growth in northeast Florida. We saw higher therm sales to all customer segments, residential, commercial and industrial, as a result of the periods of cold weather in the quarter, as well as continued economic growth.
On the expense side, O&M was lower in 2014 while depreciation was up. 
New Mexico Gas fourth quarter results benefited from customer growth and the start of the winter heating season even though it was actually milder than normal and milder than 2013. New Mexico Gas is much more seasonal than Peoples Gas, and the fourth quarter is a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.03 of accretion to our consolidated fourth quarter earnings.
The other net segment is what we used to refer to as parent other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the fourth quarter compared to last year driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, which is a parent of New Mexico Gas Company; and the interest that we no longer allocated to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operation.
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide unemployment at the end of the fourth quarter was 5.6%, an improvement of 7/10 from a year ago. At the same time, the state have added more than 233,000 new jobs over the past year with the largest number of new jobs occurring in business services; trade transport and utilities; and leisure and hospitality. The biggest percentage gain occurred again this quarter in the construction sector, which has 8% to 10% employment gains every quarter this year.
Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, also continues to do well. We appeared to be back to the pattern that was normal before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than both the state and natural level. The employment rate in local area is down to 5.2%, 6/10 below where it was a year ago, and it is not a function of people leaving the workforce as workforce grew by 0.5% in the same time frame. Over the past year, the Tampa-St. Pete area added more than 14,000 jobs with the largest gains in business services followed by trade transport and utilities.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and the large presence of governmental facilities in the state, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the level we saw in Florida, where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the housing market crash. The largest gains in New Mexico's 2014 job growth of 13,000 came in trade transport and utilities, and education and health services.
To put some perspective on the job numbers here, it's interesting to note that the population of New Mexico at about 2.1 million was actually less than the population of the Tampa-St. Pete MSA, which has a population of about 2.8 million. 
Taxable sale both in Florida and in Hillsborough County continued to grow at the strong pace we've seen pretty consistently over the last 4 years. We don't have that statistics here for New Mexico as we haven't yet found a ready source of similar information.
On the housing front, more than 5,000 single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory in 2014, and existing homes continue to sell at a strong pace. 
The January Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.8% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remains at a healthy level of 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013.
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily although slowly since the downturn, and the housing inventory is about 6 months. You can see all of these trends on the graphs in the appendix.
I'm not going to cover all of the details on the New Mexico Gas acquisition, but I do want to point to a few important takeaways. Consistent with the outlook we provided in our third quarter call, the acquisition was accretive to fourth quarter earnings by $0.03; and for the full year, $0.01. You'll recall that it diluted EPS $0.02 in the third quarter as we had the associated shares outstanding in the entire quarter and 1 month of ownership during the typical seasonal loss period.
With our 2015 business plans in place and with the rapid progress of implementing our integration plan, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to full year 2015 earnings, and that's earlier than we originally anticipated.
Last October, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to Cambrian Coal Corporation, a subsidiary of Booth Energy, a central Appalachian coal producer with operations in the same general areas as TECO Coal. The sale was contingent upon the purchasers obtaining financing. The coal markets have continued to weaken for several months now. And last week, we amended the agreement to adjust the selling price to reflect market condition and to extend the closing date to March 13. Under the amended agreement, we will receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reach certain levels. The purchaser launched financing activities last week after the amended agreement was executed.
In the third quarter, we classified TECO Coal's operations as discontinued operation and its assets as assets held for sale. At that time, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $64.8 million after-tax. We recorded additional impairment of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter, and the $16.6 million fourth quarter loss in discontinued operations includes that additional charge and the operating result of TECO Coal. Those operating results were impacted by costs related to preparing the company for the sale, such as severance and other employee termination costs. As we've disclosed previously, the actual closing of the sale will trigger an additional liability-related charge, which we estimate at $7 million.
Turning to guidance. We expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11 excluding non-GAAP charges or gain. This is a tighter range than we've provided in the past, and that's because our business mix is now all regulated utilities. And while weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating companies have typically been successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range.
We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of its allowed ROE range. That's driven by customer growth that we expect will be in line with 2014; energy sales to retail customers other than phosphate, off an estimated 1%; higher AFUDC as we enter a peak spending year for the full conversion project; and an additional $7.5 million of higher base rate that became effective November 1 last year.
On the expense side, continued investment in facilities to serve customers will drive higher depreciation and interest costs, while projecting lower O&M expense, however, in part, as we realize benefits from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee-related expenses including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in planned assets are among the factors contributing to lower expense. And because the acquisition of New Mexico Gas and sale of TECO Coal caused us to remeasure pension expense last year, that remeasurement captured the negative impact of lower discount rates and mortality improvement in 2014.
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above its allowed mid-point return, which is 10 3/4%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw last year to continue into 2015 and expect continued interest in vehicle fleet conversion to compress natural gas as well. Although current gasoline prices are helpful, the economics are still favorable, and there are environmental benefits that users like to promote. At the end of 2014, Peoples Gas had 31 CNG filling stations on its system and the annual volume was the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. We expect that number to grow again in 2015. And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric.
2015 will represent our first full year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company. And as I said, we expected to be accretive in that first full year. And I'd like to be clear that there's no creative math in that statement as I'm taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest costs and the shares we issued. We expect customer growth to start the year at about the same levels as 2014 and trend up through the course of the year with growth in therm sales largely in line with customer growth. We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies, and we also have the room [ph] credits of $2 million in the first 12 months post closing and $4 million in each subsequent 12-month period, which have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only have 4 months of ownership with New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide shows some information on previous years to provide some full year context. The Form 2 filed with the New Mexico Commission reported New Mexico Gas Company net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal; and $18 million in 2012, when heating degree days were well below normal; and higher rates approved by the commission became effective after the January peak load that already occurred.
This slide is just to remind us to show the normal seasonal earnings pattern we expect from NMGC. They make their money in the cold weather in the first and fourth quarters, a fairly normal pattern for a gas LDC that's heavily residential. It actually complements our existing earnings pattern nicely as Tampa Electric's strongest quarters are typically the second and third quarters with summer air-conditioning load.
The segment we referred to us Other net includes interest at the unrelated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impacts, and smaller operating companies. The only one of note being TECO's pipeline. We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate. Although we won't be allocating any interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the negative impact from that will be offset by the benefit of refinancing a maturing note series that has a coupon of 6.75%.
I would summarize our longer-term outlook in this way. Our regulated businesses are investing in infrastructure to serve customers and our growing rate base 5% to 7%. Our target is to deliver ratable earnings growth that's inline with rate base growth. The challenges in 2016, recognizing that Tampa Electric's rate base growth is heavily influenced by full conversion projects while an additional $110 million of annual revenue will become effective when that project goes into service at the beginning of '17. The base rate increase that benefits 2016 is only $5 million, So a key to delivering earnings growth in 2016 will be effective management of cost across the organization.
You can see this on the graphic representation of Tampa Electric's rate base, which shows it stepping up significantly in '17 when Polk goes in service. The base revenue pattern is very aligned with the rate base growth you see here. The 2013 rate settlement provided additional base revenues of $57.5 million effective November 1, 2013, which coincided with 2014 rate base growth; $7.5 million at November 1, 2014; $5 million at the same date in '15; and then $110 million when Polk goes in service in '17. This graph shows average rate base, and it excludes the assets that we earned on separately through the environmental cost recovery clause and the construction work in progress that earns AFUDC above a threshold amount that is included in rate base.
As a reference point at the end of September of '14, actual average rate base was $4.1 billion, the environmental assets were about $400 million, and that clip was about $200 million.
Also, with our upcoming Investor communications schedule, we expect to file our 10-K at the end of this month, and we will be at the UBS and Morgan Stanley conferences the following week, and at the Barclays conference in Atlanta in the middle of March.

We think that the commission is receptive to the right projects. In fact, last year, late in the year, I think it was during the fourth quarter, we announced the plans to install a larger scale of solar facility at the Tampa International Airport. So we're moving in that direction. We look ahead to our next capacity need after the Polk expansion being in about 2020. And while we have that kind of penciled in as a combustion turbine at this point, we think it's likely that through some combination of various size solar projects, we'd see that CT replaced with solar capacity.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your flexibility with the revised date for our call, which was necessary in order to work through the accounting impact of amending our agreement to sell the coal company. We were in discussions with the purchaser, and it became clear that a revision to the selling price was necessary. And since the appropriate accounting was to reflect that impact in the fourth quarter, we rescheduled the call in order to make the required changes to our financial statements.
Today, I'll cover our financial results, what we're seeing in the Florida and New Mexico economies, the sale of TECO Coal and 2015 guidance as well as the longer-term outlook. As usual, the Appendix to this presentation contains graphs on the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $45 million or $0.19 per share compared with $0.18 last year. GAAP net income was $10.8 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations of $16.6 million reflecting impairment charges of $11.6 million and the operating results of TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations were $27.4 million in 2014 and includes $17.6 million of charges, consisting of transaction and integration costs of $3 million related to the New Mexico Gas acquisition and the $14.6 million adjustment to deferred state income taxes related to the pending sale of TECO Coal. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP results for continuing operations were $0.19 per share.
For the full year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $1.03 per share, 11% higher than 2013's $0.91. GAAP net income of $130.4 million or $0.58 includes a loss in discontinued operations of $76 million, which largely reflects value impairments at TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations was $206.4 million or $0.92 and includes $23.3 million of charges and net tax adjustments related to acquisition and sale activities. Excluding these items yields the non-GAAP results of $229.7 million or $1.03 per share.
Tampa Electric reported slightly lower net income in the fourth quarter. While customer growth was a strong 1.6% and we had 1 additional month of higher revenues from a 2013 rate settlement, energy sales were lower due to milder weather resulting in fourth quarter revenues in 2014 about the same as the prior year. 
AFUDC increased this quarter with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and the related water project; and O&M expense was lower. The quarter-over-quarter increase in depreciation expense represented more than just the normal increase from additions to facilities. That's because in 2013, fourth quarter depreciation had included the benefit of a full 12 months of lower amortization costs to retroactively reflect the change in software life agreed to a November 2013 rate case settlement.
Weather patterns resulted in retail net energy per load in the fourth quarter that was 2.8% below 2013. Looking at degree days, which were 10% below normal and 12% below last year, you might expect energy sales to be off more than they were even with the customer growth we saw. In Tampa, we actually have both heating and cooling degree days in the fourth quarter. In this quarter, heating degree days were about normal and cooling degree days were well below normal, and that combination produced a milder impact on energy usage than the 10% and 12% degree days variances would suggest.
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, which was higher than our full year estimates. That was due to robust growth in several of the southwest Florida markets that had been the most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as substantial growth in northeast Florida. We saw higher therm sales to all customer segments, residential, commercial and industrial, as a result of the periods of cold weather in the quarter, as well as continued economic growth.
On the expense side, O&M was lower in 2014 while depreciation was up. 
New Mexico Gas fourth quarter results benefited from customer growth and the start of the winter heating season even though it was actually milder than normal and milder than 2013. New Mexico Gas is much more seasonal than Peoples Gas, and the fourth quarter is a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.03 of accretion to our consolidated fourth quarter earnings.
The other net segment is what we used to refer to as parent other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the fourth quarter compared to last year driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, which is a parent of New Mexico Gas Company; and the interest that we no longer allocated to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operation.
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide unemployment at the end of the fourth quarter was 5.6%, an improvement of 7/10 from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 233,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in business services, trade transport and utilities and leisure and hospitality. The biggest percentage gain occurred again this quarter in the construction sector, which has posted 8% to 10% employment gains every quarter this year.
Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, also continues to do well. We appear to be back to the pattern that was normal before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than both the state and national level. The employment rate in local area is down to 5.2%, 6/10 below where it was a year ago, and it is not a function of people leaving the workforce, as workforce grew by 0.5% in the same time frame. Over the past year, the Tampa-St. Pete area added more than 14,000 jobs, with the largest gains in business services followed by trade transport and utilities.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and the large presence of governmental facilities in the state, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the levels we saw in Florida, where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the housing market crash. The largest gains in New Mexico's 2014 job growth of 13,000 came in trade transport and utilities and education and health services.
To put some perspective on the job numbers here, it's interesting to note that the population of New Mexico of about 2.1 million was actually less than the population of the Tampa-St. Pete MSA, which has a population of about 2.8 million. 
Taxable sale, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continue to grow at the strong pace we've seen pretty consistently over the last 4 years. We don't have that statistics here for New Mexico, as we haven't yet found a ready source of similar information.
On the housing front, more than 5,000 single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory in 2014, and existing homes continue to sell at a strong pace. 
The January Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.8% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remains at a healthy level of 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013.
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily although slowly since the downturn, and the housing inventory is about 6 months. You can see all of these trends on the graphs in the Appendix.
I'm not going to cover all of the details on the New Mexico Gas acquisition, but I do want to point to a few important takeaways. Consistent with the outlook we provided in our third quarter call, the acquisition was accretive to fourth quarter earnings by $0.03; and for the full year, $0.01. You'll recall that it diluted EPS $0.02 in the third quarter as we had the associated shares outstanding in the entire quarter and 1 month of ownership during the typical seasonal loss period.
With our 2015 business plans in place and with the rapid progress implementing our integration plan, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to full year 2015 earnings, and that's earlier than we originally anticipated.
Last October, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to Cambrian Coal Corporation, a subsidiary of Booth Energy, a central Appalachian coal producer with operations in the same general areas as TECO Coal. The sale was contingent upon the purchasers obtaining financing. The coal markets have continued to weaken for several months now. And last week, we amended the agreement to adjust the selling price to reflect market condition and to extend the closing date to March 13. Under the amended agreement, we will receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reach certain levels. The purchaser launched financing activities last week after the amended agreement was executed.
In the third quarter, we classified TECO Coal's operations as discontinued operation and its assets as assets held for sale. At that time, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $64.8 million after-tax. We recorded additional impairment of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter, and the $16.6 million fourth quarter loss in discontinued operations includes that additional charge and the operating result of TECO Coal. Those operating results were impacted by costs related to preparing the company for the sale, such as severance and other employee termination costs. As we've disclosed previously, the actual closing of the sale will trigger an additional liability-related charge, which we estimate at $7 million.
Turning to guidance. We expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11 excluding non-GAAP charges or gain. This is a tighter range than we've provided in the past, and that's because our business mix is now all regulated utilities. And while weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating companies have typically been successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range.
We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of its allowed ROE range. That's driven by customer growth that we expect will be in line with 2014; energy sales to retail customers other than phosphate, off an estimated 1%; higher AFUDC as we enter a peak spending year for the full conversion project; and an additional $7.5 million of higher base rate that became effective November 1 last year.
On the expense side, continued investment in facilities to serve customers will drive higher depreciation and interest costs. We're projecting lower O&M expense, however, in part, as we realize benefits from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee-related expenses including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in planned assets are among the factors contributing to the lower expense. And because the acquisition of New Mexico Gas and sale of TECO Coal caused us to remeasure pension expense last year, that remeasurement captured the negative impact of lower discount rates and mortality improvement in 2014.
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above its allowed mid-point return, which is 10 3/4%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw last year to continue into 2015 and expect continued interest in vehicle fleet conversion to compress natural gas as well. Although current gasoline prices are helpful, the economics are still favorable, and there are environmental benefits that users like to promote. At the end of 2014, Peoples Gas had 31 CNG filling stations on its system, and the annual volume was the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. We expect that number to grow again in 2015. And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric.
2015 will represent our first full year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company. And as I said, we expect it to be accretive in that first full year. And I'd like to be clear that there's no creative math in that statement as I'm taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest costs and the shares we issued. We expect customer growth to start the year at about the same levels as 2014 and trend up through the course of the year with growth in therm sales largely in line with customer growth. We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies, and we also have the REIT credit of $2 million in the first 12 months post-closing and $4 million in each subsequent 12-month period, which have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only have 4 months of ownership with New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide shows some information on previous years to provide some full year context. The Form 2 filed with the New Mexico Commission reported New Mexico Gas Company net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal; and $18 million in 2012, when heating degree days were well below normal; and higher rates approved by the commission became effective after the January peak load that already occurred.
This slide is just to remind us to show the normal seasonal earnings pattern we expect from NMGC. They make their money in the cold weather in the first and fourth quarters, a fairly normal pattern for a gas LDC that's heavily residential. It actually complements our existing earnings pattern nicely as Tampa Electric's strongest quarters are typically the second and third quarters with summer air-conditioning load.
The segment we refer to us Other net includes interest at the unrelated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impacts and smaller operating companies, the only one of note being TECO's pipeline. We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate. Although we won't be allocating any interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the negative impact from that will be offset by the benefit of refinancing a maturing note series that has a coupon of 6.75%.
I would summarize our longer-term outlook in this way. Our regulated businesses are investing in infrastructure to serve customers in our growing rate base 5% to 7%. Our target is to deliver ratable earnings growth that's in line with rate base growth. The challenges in 2016, recognizing that Tampa Electric's rate base growth is heavily influenced by full conversion projects while an additional $110 million of annual revenue will become effective when that project goes into service at the beginning of '17, the base rate increase that benefits 2016 is only $5 million. So a key to delivering earnings growth in 2016 will be effective management of cost across the organization.
You can see this on the graphic representation of Tampa Electric's rate base, which shows it stepping up significantly in '17 when Polk goes in service. The base revenue pattern is very aligned with the rate base growth you see here. The 2013 rate settlement provided additional base revenues of $57.5 million effective November 1, 2013, which coincided with 2014 rate base growth; $7.5 million at November 1, 2014; $5 million at the same date in '15; and then $110 million when Polk goes in service in '17. This graph shows average rate base, and it excludes the assets that we earn on separately through the environmental cost recovery clause and the construction work in progress that earns AFUDC above a threshold amount that is included in rate base.
As a reference point, at the end of September of '14, actual average rate base was $4.1 billion, the environmental assets were about $400 million and that clip was about $200 million.
Also, with our upcoming Investor communications schedule, we expect to file our 10-K at the end of this month, and we will be at the UBS and Morgan Stanley conferences the following week and at the Barclays conference in Atlanta in the middle of March.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the TECO Energy Fourth Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. Our earnings, along with unaudited financial statements, were released and filed with the SEC earlier this morning. This presentation is being webcast; and our earnings release, financial statements and slides for this presentation are available on our website at tecoenergy.com. The presentation will be available for replay through the website approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of our presentation and will be available for 30 days.
In the course of our remarks today, we will be making forward-looking statements about our expectations for 2015 and beyond and our integration of New Mexico Gas Company and the sale of TECO Coal. There are number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we'll discuss today. For a more complete discussion of these factors, we refer you to the risk factor discussion in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013, and an updated and subsequent filings with the SEC. In the course of today's presentation, we will be using non-GAAP results. There is a reconciliation between these non-GAAP measures and the closest GAAP measure in the Appendix to today's presentation.
The host for our call today is Sandy Callahan, TECO Energy's Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is John Ramil, TECO Energy's CEO, to assist in answering your questions.
Now let me turn it over to Sandy."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your flexibility with the revised date for our call, which was necessary in order to work through the accounting impact of amending our agreement to sell the coal company. We were in discussions with the purchaser, and it became clear that a revision to the selling price was necessary. And since the appropriate accounting was to reflect that impact in the fourth quarter, we rescheduled the call in order to make the required changes to our financial statements.
Today, I'll cover our financial results, what we're seeing in the Florida and New Mexico economies, the sale of TECO Coal and 2015 guidance as well as the longer-term outlook. As usual, the Appendix to this presentation contains graphs on the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $45 million or $0.19 per share compared with $0.18 last year. GAAP net income was $10.8 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations of $16.6 million reflecting impairment charges of $11.6 million and the operating results of TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations were $27.4 million in 2014 and includes $17.6 million of charges, consisting of transaction and integration costs of $3 million related to the New Mexico Gas acquisition and the $14.6 million adjustment to deferred state income taxes related to the pending sale of TECO Coal. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP results for continuing operations were $0.19 per share.
For the full year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $1.03 per share, 11% higher than 2013's $0.91. GAAP net income of $130.4 million or $0.58 includes a loss in discontinued operations of $76 million, which largely reflects value impairments at TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations was $206.4 million or $0.92 and includes $23.3 million of charges and net tax adjustments related to acquisition and sale activities. Excluding these items yields the non-GAAP results of $229.7 million or $1.03 per share.
Tampa Electric reported slightly lower net income in the fourth quarter. While customer growth was a strong 1.6% and we had 1 additional month of higher revenues from a 2013 rate settlement, energy sales were lower due to milder weather resulting in fourth quarter revenues in 2014 about the same as the prior year. 
AFUDC increased this quarter with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and the related water project; and O&M expense was lower. The quarter-over-quarter increase in depreciation expense represented more than just the normal increase from additions to facilities. That's because in 2013, fourth quarter depreciation had included the benefit of a full 12 months of lower amortization costs to retroactively reflect the change in software life agreed to a November 2013 rate case settlement.
Weather patterns resulted in retail net energy per load in the fourth quarter that was 2.8% below 2013. Looking at degree days, which were 10% below normal and 12% below last year, you might expect energy sales to be off more than they were even with the customer growth we saw. In Tampa, we actually have both heating and cooling degree days in the fourth quarter. In this quarter, heating degree days were about normal and cooling degree days were well below normal, and that combination produced a milder impact on energy usage than the 10% and 12% degree days variances would suggest.
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, which was higher than our full year estimates. That was due to robust growth in several of the southwest Florida markets that had been the most impacted in the economic downturn as well as substantial growth in northeast Florida. We saw higher therm sales to all customer segments, residential, commercial and industrial, as a result of the periods of cold weather in the quarter as well as continued economic growth.
On the expense side, O&M was lower in 2014 while depreciation was up. 
New Mexico Gas fourth quarter results benefited from customer growth and the start of the winter heating season even though it was actually milder than normal and milder than 2013. New Mexico Gas is much more seasonal than Peoples Gas, and the fourth quarter is a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.03 of accretion to our consolidated fourth quarter earnings.
The other net segment is what we used to refer to as parent other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the fourth quarter compared to last year driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, which is a parent of New Mexico Gas Company; and the interest that we no longer allocated to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operation.
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide unemployment at the end of the fourth quarter was 5.6%, an improvement of 7/10 from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 233,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in business services, trade transport and utilities and leisure and hospitality. The biggest percentage gain occurred again this quarter in the construction sector, which has posted 8% to 10% employment gains every quarter this year.
Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, also continues to do well. We appear to be back to the pattern that was normal before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than both the state and national level. The employment rate in local area is down to 5.2%, 6/10 below where it was a year ago, and it is not a function of people leaving the workforce, as workforce grew by 0.5% in the same time frame. Over the past year, the Tampa-St. Pete area added more than 14,000 jobs, with the largest gains in business services followed by trade transport and utilities.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and the large presence of governmental facilities in the state, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the levels we saw in Florida, where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the housing market crash. The largest gains in New Mexico's 2014 job growth of 13,000 came in trade transport and utilities and education and health services.
To put some perspective on the job numbers here, it's interesting to note that the population of New Mexico of about 2.1 million was actually less than the population of the Tampa-St. Pete MSA, which has a population of about 2.8 million. 
Taxable sale, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continue to grow at the strong pace we've seen pretty consistently over the last 4 years. We don't have that statistics here for New Mexico, as we haven't yet found a ready source of similar information.
On the housing front, more than 5,000 single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory in 2014, and existing homes continue to sell at a strong pace. 
The January Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.8% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remains at a healthy level of 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013.
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily although slowly since the downturn, and the housing inventory is about 6 months. You can see all of these trends on the graphs in the Appendix.
I'm not going to cover all of the details on the New Mexico Gas acquisition, but I do want to point to a few important takeaways. Consistent with the outlook we provided in our third quarter call, the acquisition was accretive to fourth quarter earnings by $0.03; and for the full year, $0.01. You'll recall that it diluted EPS $0.02 in the third quarter as we had the associated shares outstanding in the entire quarter and 1 month of ownership during the typical seasonal loss period.
With our 2015 business plans in place and with the rapid progress implementing our integration plan, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to full year 2015 earnings, and that's earlier than we originally anticipated.
Last October, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to Cambrian Coal Corporation, a subsidiary of Booth Energy, a central Appalachian coal producer with operations in the same general areas as TECO Coal. The sale was contingent upon the purchasers obtaining financing. The coal markets have continued to weaken for several months now. And last week, we amended the agreement to adjust the selling price to reflect market condition and to extend the closing date to March 13. Under the amended agreement, we will receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reach certain levels. The purchaser launched financing activities last week after the amended agreement was executed.
In the third quarter, we classified TECO Coal's operations as discontinued operation and its assets as assets held for sale. At that time, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $64.8 million after-tax. We recorded additional impairment of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter, and the $16.6 million fourth quarter loss in discontinued operations includes that additional charge and the operating result of TECO Coal. Those operating results were impacted by costs related to preparing the company for the sale, such as severance and other employee termination costs. As we've disclosed previously, the actual closing of the sale will trigger an additional liability-related charge, which we estimate at $7 million.
Turning to guidance. We expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11 excluding non-GAAP charges or gain. This is a tighter range than we've provided in the past, and that's because our business mix is now all regulated utilities. And while weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating companies have typically been successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range.
We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of its allowed ROE range. That's driven by customer growth that we expect will be in line with 2014; energy sales to retail customers other than phosphate, off an estimated 1%; higher AFUDC as we enter a peak spending year for the full conversion project; and an additional $7.5 million of higher base rate that became effective November 1 last year.
On the expense side, continued investment in facilities to serve customers will drive higher depreciation and interest costs. We're projecting lower O&M expense, however, in part, as we realize benefits from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee-related expenses including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in planned assets are among the factors contributing to the lower expense. And because the acquisition of New Mexico Gas and sale of TECO Coal caused us to remeasure pension expense last year, that remeasurement captured the negative impact of lower discount rates and mortality improvement in 2014.
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above its allowed mid-point return, which is 10 3/4%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw last year to continue into 2015 and expect continued interest in vehicle fleet conversion to compress natural gas as well. Although current gasoline prices are helpful, the economics are still favorable, and there are environmental benefits that users like to promote. At the end of 2014, Peoples Gas had 31 CNG filling stations on its system, and the annual volume was the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. We expect that number to grow again in 2015. And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric.
2015 will represent our first full year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company. And as I said, we expect it to be accretive in that first full year. And I'd like to be clear that there's no creative math in that statement as I'm taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest costs and the shares we issued. We expect customer growth to start the year at about the same levels as 2014 and trend up through the course of the year with growth in therm sales largely in line with customer growth. We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies, and we also have the REIT credit of $2 million in the first 12 months post-closing and $4 million in each subsequent 12-month period, which have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only have 4 months of ownership with New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide shows some information on previous years to provide some full year context. The Form 2 filed with the New Mexico Commission reported New Mexico Gas Company net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal; and $18 million in 2012, when heating degree days were well below normal; and higher rates approved by the commission became effective after the January peak load that already occurred.
This slide is just to remind us to show the normal seasonal earnings pattern we expect from NMGC. They make their money in the cold weather in the first and fourth quarters, a fairly normal pattern for a gas LDC that's heavily residential. It actually complements our existing earnings pattern nicely as Tampa Electric's strongest quarters are typically the second and third quarters with summer air-conditioning load.
The segment we refer to us Other net includes interest at the unrelated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impacts and smaller operating companies, the only one of note being TECO's pipeline. We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate. Although we won't be allocating any interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the negative impact from that will be offset by the benefit of refinancing a maturing note series that has a coupon of 6.75%.
I would summarize our longer-term outlook in this way. Our regulated businesses are investing in infrastructure to serve customers in our growing rate base 5% to 7%. Our target is to deliver ratable earnings growth that's in line with rate base growth. The challenges in 2016, recognizing that Tampa Electric's rate base growth is heavily influenced by full conversion projects while an additional $110 million of annual revenue will become effective when that project goes into service at the beginning of '17, the base rate increase that benefits 2016 is only $5 million. So a key to delivering earnings growth in 2016 will be effective management of cost across the organization.
You can see this on the graphic representation of Tampa Electric's rate base, which shows it stepping up significantly in '17 when Polk goes in service. The base revenue pattern is very aligned with the rate base growth you see here. The 2013 rate settlement provided additional base revenues of $57.5 million effective November 1, 2013, which coincided with 2014 rate base growth; $7.5 million at November 1, 2014; $5 million at the same date in '15; and then $110 million when Polk goes in service in '17. This graph shows average rate base, and it excludes the assets that we earn on separately through the environmental cost recovery clause and the construction work in progress that earns AFUDC above a threshold amount that is included in rate base.
As a reference point, at the end of September of '14, actual average rate base was $4.1 billion, the environmental assets were about $400 million and that clip was about $200 million.
Also, with our upcoming Investor communications schedule, we expect to file our 10-K at the end of this month, and we will be at the UBS and Morgan Stanley conferences the following week and at the Barclays conference in Atlanta in the middle of March.

So we're moving in that direction. We looked ahead to our next capacity need after the Polk expansion, being in about 2020, and while we have that kind of penciled in as a combustion turbine at this point, we think it's likely that through some combination of various size solar projects, we'd see that CT replaced with solar capacity.

306596,290916098,796301,"TECO Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","TECO Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us so late in the day. As is our customer for the first quarter, we released earnings and are holding our call this afternoon so that we can share our current financial results at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which is tomorrow morning. 
Today, I will cover our first quarter results and economic updates and our 2015 guidance with the quarter of the year now behind us. The appendix to this presentation contains graph from the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. 
In the first quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $64.5 million or $0.28 per share compared with $0.23 last year. GAAP net income was $58 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations of $5.8 million, reflecting the operating results of TECO Coal. Net income from continuing operations was $63.8 million in 2015, and includes $700,000 charges consisting of certain cost related to the New Mexico Gas integration. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $0.28 per share. 
Results in the quarter reflects about $0.04 of accretion from the acquisition of New Mexico Gas. Tampa Electric reported higher net income of the first quarter, customer growth was a strong 1.7%, and we had the first quarter effect of the $7.5 million base revenue increase that became effective November 1 of last year under Tampa Electric's 2013 regulatory stipulation. The strong customer growth and better weather resulted in first quarter energy sales of 1.4% higher than last year. 
AFUDC also increased this quarter, with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
First quarter weather was a mixed bag. February was cool and wet, which helped Peoples Gas, but was not cold enough to create heating demand in Tampa Electric service area. In March, had cooling degree days significantly above normal, which had air conditioners running early in the season. So March energy sales were up, but not to the same magnitude as the cooling degree days were. With the lower humidity and cooler nights, the unusually high daytime temperatures we saw in March  don't generate the same energy sales volume as they would in a continuously hot and humid summer months when air conditioners just seem to run 24/7. 
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2% in the first quarter, a continuation of the growth that we saw a last year. Customer growth was strongest in the Southwest Florida market that had been most impacted in the economic downturn as well as in the Northeast Florida and Jacksonville areas. 
We saw higher firm sales to all customer segments: Residential, commercial and industrial, helped by February 's cold-weather and continued economic growth. 
On the expense side, O&M was higher than last year, but only because O&M in 2014 included a benefit of the significant cost recovery. 
I'm really not trying to [indiscernible] about how pleasant our winter weather was here, but it was. But record tourism has been good for the local economy. According to Visit Tampa Bay, which is a visitor information organization for this area, hotel tax collections in the Tampa area set record every month in the quarter. And for the 6 months ended March 2015 were almost 15% higher than they were in 2014. 
And both Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas have experienced higher sales to commercial customers in the hotel and restaurant categories as the result of the record tourism.
First quarter results at New Mexico Gas benefited from customer growth, and of course, the winter heating season. Although it was much milder than normal and about inline with 2014. 
New Mexico Gas is significantly more seasonal than Peoples Gas, and the first quarter is a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.04 of accretion to our first quarter earnings. 
We have made great progress on our integration activities. In addition to moving forward on a variety of marketing and development initiatives, just a few of the other key areas include initiating the migration of New Mexico Gas onto our IT platform for HR, financial and procurement activities; volume pricing with common suppliers; coordinating gas supply activities; and meter repair outsourcing. 
The Other net segment is what we used to refer to as Parent Other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, or NMGI, the parent of New Mexico Gas Company, and the interest that we no longer allocat to TECO Coal, following its classification as a discontinued operation. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide, unemployment at the end of the first quarter was 5.7%, an improvement 0.8% from the year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 284,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in trade transport utilities, business services and education and health services. 
The biggest percentage gain this quarter occurred in the construction sector, which posted an almost 10% employment gain. Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, appears to be back to the pattern that was more well before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than both the state and national level. The unemployment rate in the local area is down to 5.1%, a full 1% below where it was a year ago. 
Over the past year, the Tampa St. Petersburg area added more than 34,000 jobs, with the largest gains in leisure and hospitality followed by education and health services.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and the large presence of governmental facilities in the states, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the levels that we saw in Florida where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the housing market crash. The largest gains in New Mexico's year-over-year job growth of 13,000 came in the education and health services and to professional and business services categories. 
Taxable sales both in Florida and in Hillsborough County continue to grow with a strong pace we've seen pretty consistently over the last 4 years. Reflective of the strong tourist sale on the graph on the appendix, you can see very strong uptick in January of this year. 
On the housing front, more than 5,000 new single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory over the past 12 months, and existing homes continued to sell in a strong piece. The March Case-Shiller report showed that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 5.7% year-over-year, but that doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remain at a healthy level of 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013. 
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resale have trended up fairly although slowly since the downturn, and the housing inventory is now about 5 months. And you can see all of these trends on the graph in the appendix.
Last October, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to a central Appalachian coal producer with operations in the same general area as is TECO Coal. Contingent on the purchaser, we're obtaining financing. The pushes are has been actively working to obtain the financing, meeting with investors and working with them on due diligence. We recently extended the closing date to June  5 to allow additional time for the lenders to complete their due diligence and for the parties to complete negotiations and documentations to close. The selling price, which was revised in February to reflect market conditions, remains unchanged. We will receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reached certain levels. 
Discontinued operations in the quarter reflect the operating results of TECO Coal net of a small tax benefit. Those operating results include the impact of harsh winter weather on mining operations and rail service as well as the effects related to preparing the company for the sale such as severance and other employee termination costs. 
We are maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11, excluding non-GAAP charges or gains. And weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating companies have typically been successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range. We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of its allowed ROE range. That is being driven big customer growth, higher AFUDC and the additional $7.5 million of higher base rates that became effective November 1 last year. 
We expect to higher depreciation expense from normal addition to facilities to reliably served customers. We're projecting lower O&M expense, in part as we realize some benefits from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee-related expenses, including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in plan assets are contributing to that lower expense. 
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above its allowed midpoint return of 10.75%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw in the first quarter and last year to continue, and expect a continued interest in vehicle fleet conversion to compressed natural gas. Even with current gasoline prices, the economics are still favorable and their environmental benefits that users like to promote. At the end of 2014, Peoples Gas has 31 CNG filling stations on its system and the annual volume was the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. 
We recently signed a contract to supply Orlando as to convert its fleet of 300 buses to CNG over the next several years, and we will also be supplying the City of Orlando with CNG for its 35 tracks solid waste disposal operation. 
And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric. 
2015 will represent our first full year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company, and we expect it to be accretive in that first full year. 
Taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest and the shares we issued. We expect customer growth grants to be similar to the first quarter, with the trends up through the year, with growth in firm sales largely in line with customer growth. 
We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies, and we also have the great credits, which will be about $2.5 million in 2015 and have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only have 4 months of ownership of New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide shows an information on previous years to provide some full-year context. The Form 2s, filed with the New Mexico Commission, reported New Mexico Gas net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal. And $18 million in 2012 when degree days were well below normal, and the higher base rates that were approved by the commission became effective after the January peak load had already occurred. 
The 2014 Form 2 is expected to be filed next week, and it will contain mixed results, reflecting 8 months of ownership by Continental and 4 months of our ownership.
The segment we refer to as Other net includes interest of the unregulated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impact and smaller operating companies, the only one of note being Seacoast pipeline. 
We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 here will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at NMGI. Although we won't be allocating interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the negative impact from that will be offset the benefit of refinancing of 6.75% note maturity, with $250 million of floating rate notes at a much lower interest cost.
With New Mexico Gas in our business mix, our quarterly earnings pattern will look different going forward. This slide shows the normal seasonal earnings pattern we expect from New Mexico Gas, a fairly normal pattern for gas distribution system with significant residential heating load. It actually complements our existing earnings factoring nicely, contributing to higher first and fourth quarter earnings, while Tampa Electric's strongest quarters was summer air conditioning load will overlay the weaker quarters in New Mexico. As a result, the first quarter will now be one of our higher earnings quarters, and the second quarter our lowest. The third quarter, with the summer air conditioning load, is still expected to be our highest earnings quarter, and fourth quarter will now reflect the start of winter in New Mexico. 
Because completion of our Polk conversion project is an important component of our 2017 outlook, I want to provide a brief status on the construction activities you see here. In short, the project is on schedule and on budget. This is proven conventional technology, and the project's scope is actually smaller than the Bayside conversion project that we successfully completed on-time and on-budget in the 2003, 2004 time frame. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communications schedule. We expect to file our 10-Q at the end of this week. We will be busy in May starting with the Citi and Deutsche Bank conferences in the middle of the month, followed by the AGA conference the following week. And in June, we will make our annual trip to Toronto, and we'll meet with Canadian investors at the UBS conference. 
And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the lines to your questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us so late in the day. As is our custom for the first quarter, we released earnings and are holding our call this afternoon so that we can share our current financial results at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which is tomorrow morning. 
Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and economic update and our 2015 guidance with a quarter of the year now behind us. The appendix to this presentation contains graphs from the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. 
In the first quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $64.5 million or $0.28 per share compared with $0.23 last year. GAAP net income was $58 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations of $5.8 million, reflecting the operating results at TECO Coal. 
Net income from continuing operations was $63.8 million in 2015, and includes $700,000 of charges consisting of certain costs related to the New Mexico Gas integration. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $0.28 per share. Results in the quarter reflects about $0.04 of accretion from the acquisition of New Mexico Gas. 
Tampa Electric reported higher net income in the first quarter. Customer growth was a strong 1.7%, and we had the first quarter effect of the $7.5 million base revenue increase that became effective November 1 of last year under Tampa Electric's 2013 regulatory stipulation. The strong customer growth and better weather resulted in first quarter energy sales 1.4% higher than last year. AFUDC also increased this quarter, with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
First quarter weather was a mixed bag. February was cool and wet, which helped Peoples Gas, but was not cold enough to create heating demand in Tampa Electric's service area. And March had cooling degree days significantly above normal, which had air conditioners running early in the season. So March energy sales were up, but not to the same magnitude as the cooling degree days were. With the lower humidity and cooler nights, the unusually high daytime temperatures we saw in March don't generate the same energy sales volume as they would in the continuously hot and humid summer months when air conditioners just seem to run 24/7. 
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2% in the first quarter, a continuation of the growth that we saw last year. Customer growth was strongest in the Southwest Florida market that had been most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as in the Northeast Florida and Jacksonville areas. We saw higher therm sales to all customer segments: Residential, commercial and industrial, helped by February's cold-weather and continued economic growth. 
On the expense side, O&M was higher than last year, but only because O&M in 2014 included the benefit of the significant cost recovery. 
I'm really not trying to rub it in about how pleasant our winter weather was here, but it was. But record tourism has been good for the local economy. According to Visit Tampa Bay, which is a visitor information organization for this area, hotel bed tax collections in the Tampa area set records every month in the quarter, and for the 6 months ended March 2015, were almost 15% higher than they were in 2014. And both Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas have experienced higher sales to commercial customers in the hotel and restaurant categories as a result of the record tourism.
First quarter results at New Mexico Gas benefited from customer growth, and of course, the winter heating season, although it was much milder than normal and about in-line with 2014. New Mexico Gas is significantly more seasonal than Peoples Gas, and the first quarter is a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.04 of accretion to our first quarter earnings. 
We have made great progress on our integration activities. In addition to moving forward on a variety of marketing and development initiatives, just a few of the other key areas include: Initiating the migration of New Mexico Gas onto our IT platform for HR, financial and procurement activities; volume pricing with common suppliers; coordinating gas supply activities; and meter repair outsourcing. 
The Other net segment is what we used to refer to as Parent Other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, or NMGI, the parent of New Mexico Gas Company, and the interest that we no longer allocated to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operation. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide, unemployment at the end of the first quarter was 5.7%, an improvement 0.8% from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 284,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in trade transport and utilities, business services and education and health services. 
The biggest percentage gain this quarter occurred in the construction sector, which posted an almost 10% employment gain. Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, appears to be back to the pattern that was normal before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than both the state and national levels. The unemployment rate in the local area is down to 5.1%, a full 1% below where it was a year ago. Over the past year, the Tampa St. Petersburg area added more than 34,000 jobs, with the largest gains in leisure and hospitality, followed by education and health services.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and the large presence of governmental facilities in the state, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the levels that we saw in Florida, where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the housing market crash. The largest gains in New Mexico's year-over-year job growth of 13,000 came in the education and health services and professional and business services categories. 
Taxable sales, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continued to grow with the strong pace we've seen pretty consistently over the last 4 years. Reflective of the strong tourist season on the graph in the appendix, you can see very strong uptick in January of this year. 
On the housing front, more than 5,000 new single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory over the past 12 months, and existing homes continued to sell at a strong piece. The March Case-Shiller report showed that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 5.7% year-over-year, but that doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remained at a healthy level of 4 months. The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013. 
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily, although slowly, since the downturn, and the housing inventory is now about 5 months. And you can see all of these trends on the graphs in the appendix.
Last October, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to a central Appalachian coal producer with operations in the same general areas as TECO Coal, contingent on the purchaser obtaining financing. The purchaser has been actively working to obtain the financing, meeting with investors and working with them on due diligence. We recently extended the closing date to June 5 to allow additional time for the lenders to complete their due diligence and for the parties to complete negotiations and documentation to close. The selling price, which was revised in February to reflect market conditions, remains unchanged. We would receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reach certain level. 
Discontinued operations in the quarter reflect the operating results of TECO Coal net of a small tax benefit. Those operating results include the impact of harsh winter weather on mining operations and rail service as well as effects related to preparing the company for the sale, such as severance and other employee-termination costs. 
We are maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11, excluding non-GAAP charges or gains. And while weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating companies have typically been successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range. We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of its allowed ROE range. That is being driven by customer growth, higher AFUDC and the additional $7.5 million of higher base rates that became effective November 1 last year. 
We expect higher depreciation expense from normal addition to facilities to reliably serve customers. We're projecting lower O&M expense, in part as we realize some benefits from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee-related expenses, including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in plan assets are contributing to that lower expense. 
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above its allowed midpoint return of 10.75%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw in the first quarter and last year to continue, and expect continued interest in vehicle fleet conversions to compressed natural gas. Even with current gasoline prices, the economics are still favorable, and there are environmental benefits that users like to promote. At the end of 2014, Peoples Gas had 31 CNG filling stations on its system and the annual volume was the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. 
We recently signed a contract to supply Orlando as it converts its fleet of 300 buses to CNG over the next several years. And we will also be supplying the City of Orlando with CNG for its 35-truck solid waste disposal operations. 
And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric. 
2015 will represent our first full year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company, and we expect it to be accretive in that first full year, taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest and the shares we issued. We expect customer growth trends to be similar to the first quarter, with the trends up through the year, with growth in therm sales largely in line with customer growth. 
We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies, and we also have the rate credit, which will be about $2.5 million, in 2015, and have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only had 4 months of ownership of New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide shows some information on previous years to provide some full-year context. The Form 2s filed with the New Mexico Commission reported New Mexico Gas net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal; and $18 million in 2012, when degree days were well below normal, and the higher base rates that were approved by the commission became effective after the January peak load had already occurred. 
The 2014 Form 2 is expected to be filed next week, and it will contain mixed results, reflecting 8 months of ownership by Continental and 4 months of our ownership.
The segment we refer to as Other net includes interest at the unregulated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impacts and smaller operating companies, the only one of note being Seacoast pipeline. We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 here will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at NMGI. 
Although we won't be allocating interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the income -- the negative impact from that will be offset by the benefit of refinancing of 6 3/4% note maturity with $250 million of floating rate notes at a much lower interest cost.
With New Mexico Gas in our business mix, our quarterly earnings pattern will look different going forward. This slide shows the normal seasonal earnings pattern we expect from New Mexico Gas, a fairly normal pattern for a gas distribution system with significant residential heating load. It actually complements our existing earnings pattern nicely, contributing to higher first and fourth quarter earnings, while Tampa Electric's strongest quarters with summer air conditioning load will overlay the weaker quarters in New Mexico. As a result, the first quarter will now be one of our higher earnings quarters, and the second quarter our lowest. The third quarter, with the summer air conditioning load, is still expected to be our highest earnings quarter, and fourth quarter will now reflect the start of winter in New Mexico. 
Because completion of our Polk conversion project is an important component of our 2017 outlook, I want to provide a brief status on the construction activities you see here. In short, the project is on-schedule and on-budget. This is proven conventional technology, and the project's scope is actually smaller than the Bayside conversion project that we successfully completed on-time and on-budget in the 2003, 2004 time frame. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communications schedule. We expect to file our 10-Q at the end of this week. We will be busy in May starting with the Citi and Deutsche Bank conferences in the middle of the month, followed by the AGA conference the following week. And in June, we will make our annual trip to Toronto, and we'll meet with Canadian investors at the UBS conference.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us so late in the day. As is our custom for the first quarter, we released earnings and are holding our call this afternoon so that we can share our current financial results at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which is tomorrow morning. 
Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and economic update and our 2015 guidance with a quarter of the year now behind us. The appendix to this presentation contains graphs from the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. 
In the first quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $64.5 million or $0.28 per share compared with $0.23 last year. GAAP net income was $58 million, which includes a loss in discontinued operations of $5.8 million, reflecting the operating results at TECO Coal. 
Net income from continuing operations was $63.8 million in 2015, and includes $700,000 of charges consisting of certain costs related to the New Mexico Gas integration. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $0.28 per share. Results in the quarter reflect about $0.04 of accretion from the acquisition of New Mexico Gas. 
Tampa Electric reported higher net income in the first quarter. Customer growth was a strong 1.7%, and we had the first quarter effect of the $7.5 million base revenue increase that became effective November 1 of last year under Tampa Electric's 2013 regulatory stipulation. The strong customer growth and better weather resulted in first quarter energy sales 1.4% higher than last year. AFUDC also increased this quarter, with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
First quarter weather was a mixed bag. February was cool and wet, which helped Peoples Gas, but was not cold enough to create heating demand in Tampa Electric's service area. And March had cooling degree days significantly above normal, which had air conditioners running early in the season. So March energy sales were up, but not to the same magnitude as the cooling degree days were. With the lower humidity and cooler nights, the unusually high daytime temperatures we saw in March don't generate the same energy sales volume as they would in the continuously hot and humid summer months when air conditioners just seem to run 24/7. 
Peoples Gas experienced strong customer growth of 2% in the first quarter, a continuation of the growth that we saw last year. Customer growth was strongest in the Southwest Florida market that had been most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as in the Northeast Florida and Jacksonville areas. We saw higher therm sales to all customer segments: Residential, commercial and industrial, helped by February's cold-weather and continued economic growth. 
On the expense side, O&M was higher than last year, but only because O&M in 2014 included the benefit of the significant cost recovery. 
I'm really not trying to rub it in about how pleasant our winter weather was here, but it was. But record tourism has been good for the local economy. According to Visit Tampa Bay, which is a visitor information organization for this area, hotel bed tax collections in the Tampa area set records every month in the quarter, and for the 6 months ended March 2015, were almost 15% higher than they were in 2014. And both Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas have experienced higher sales to commercial customers in the hotel and restaurant categories as a result of the record tourism.
First quarter results at New Mexico Gas benefited from customer growth, and of course, the winter heating season, although it was much milder than normal and about in line with 2014. New Mexico Gas is significantly more seasonal than Peoples Gas, and the first quarter is a very strong quarter for them, which resulted in about $0.04 of accretion to our first quarter earnings. 
We have made great progress on our integration activities. In addition to moving forward on a variety of marketing and development initiatives, just a few of the other key areas include: Initiating the migration of New Mexico Gas onto our IT platform for HR, financial and procurement activities; volume pricing with common suppliers; coordinating gas supply activities; and meter repair outsourcing. 
The Other net segment is what we used to refer to as Parent Other. The net cost in this segment was higher in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, or NMGI, the parent of New Mexico Gas Company, and the interest that we no longer allocated to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operation. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide, unemployment at the end of the first quarter was 5.7%, an improvement 0.8% from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 284,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in trade transport and utilities, business services and education and health services. 
The biggest percentage gain this quarter occurred in the construction sector, which posted an almost 10% employment gain. Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, appears to be back to the pattern that was normal before the economic downturn, with Tampa area unemployment being better than both the state and national levels. The unemployment rate in the local area is down to 5.1%, a full 1% below where it was a year ago. Over the past year, the Tampa St. Petersburg area added more than 34,000 jobs, with the largest gains in leisure and hospitality, followed by education and health services.
Supported by the oil and gas industries and the large presence of governmental facilities in the state, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the levels that we saw in Florida, where job losses in the construction and financial services sectors were severe due to the housing market crash. The largest gains in New Mexico's year-over-year job growth of 13,000 came in the education and health services and professional and business services categories. 
Taxable sales, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continued to grow with the strong pace we've seen pretty consistently over the last 4 years. Reflective of the strong tourist season on the graph in the appendix, you can see a very strong uptick in January of this year. 
On the housing front, more than 5,000 new single-family building permits were issued in Tampa Electric service territory over the past 12 months, and existing homes continue to sell at a strong piece. The March Case-Shiller report showed that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 5.7% year-over-year, but that doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remained at a healthy level of 4 months. The New Mexico housing market saw 5,500 building permits issued statewide in 2014, which was an 8% increase over 2013. 
In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily, although slowly, since the downturn, and the housing inventory is now about 5 months. And you can see all of these trends on the graphs in the appendix.
Last October, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell TECO Coal to a central Appalachian coal producer with operations in the same general areas as TECO Coal, contingent on the purchaser obtaining financing. The purchaser has been actively working to obtain the financing, meeting with investors and working with them on due diligence. We recently extended the closing date to June 5 to allow additional time for the lenders to complete their due diligence and for the parties to complete negotiations and documentation to close. The selling price, which was revised in February to reflect market conditions, remains unchanged. We would receive $80 million at closing and have the opportunity to receive an additional $60 million over the next 5 years if benchmark coal prices reach certain level. 
Discontinued operations in the quarter reflect the operating results of TECO Coal net of a small tax benefit. Those operating results include the impact of harsh winter weather on mining operations and rail service as well as effects related to preparing the company for the sale, such as severance and other employee-termination costs. 
We are maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11, excluding non-GAAP charges or gains. And while weather is always a variable that can affect utility performance, our operating companies have typically been successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range. We expect Tampa Electric to earn in the upper half of its allowed ROE range. That is being driven by customer growth, higher AFUDC and the additional $7.5 million of higher base rates that became effective November 1 last year. 
We expect higher depreciation expense from normal addition to facilities to reliably serve customers. We're projecting lower O&M expense, in part as we realize some benefits from acquisition-related synergies and also from lower employee-related expenses, including pension and retiree medical costs. 2015 changes to the retiree medical program and growth in plan assets are contributing to that lower expense. 
We expect Peoples Gas also to earn above its allowed midpoint return of 10.75%. Like Tampa Electric, we expect the customer growth trends we saw in the first quarter and last year to continue, and expect continued interest in vehicle fleet conversions to compressed natural gas. Even with current gasoline prices, the economics are still favorable, and there are environmental benefits that users like to promote. At the end of 2014, Peoples Gas had 31 CNG filling stations on its system and the annual volume was the equivalent of about 60,000 Florida residential customers. 
We recently signed a contract to supply Orlando as it converts its fleet of 300 buses to CNG over the next several years. And we will also be supplying the City of Orlando with CNG for its 35-truck solid waste disposal operation. 
And finally, the Peoples Gas expense profile should be similar to what I described for Tampa Electric. 
2015 will represent our first full year of ownership of New Mexico Gas Company, and we expect it to be accretive in that first full year, taking into account the performance of the regulated company, NMGI interest and the shares we issued. We expect customer growth trends to be similar to the first quarter, with the trends up through the year, with growth in therm sales largely in line with customer growth. 
We expect lower O&M from acquisition synergies, and we also have the rate credit, which will be about $2.5 million in 2015, and have the effect of sharing some of the synergies with customers.
Since we only had 4 months of ownership of New Mexico Gas in 2014, the slide shows some information on previous years to provide some full-year context. The Form 2s filed with the New Mexico Commission reported New Mexico Gas net income of $23.7 million in 2013, which was a strong weather year with heating degree days about 5% above normal; and $18 million in 2012, when degree days were well below normal, and the higher base rates that were approved by the commission became effective after the January peak load had already occurred. 
The 2014 Form 2 is expected to be filed next week, and it will contain mixed results, reflecting 8 months of ownership by Continental and 4 months of our ownership.
The segment we refer to as Other net includes interest at the unregulated finance company, interest at NMGI, certain unallocated corporate level expenses and consolidated tax impacts and smaller operating companies, the only one of note being Seacoast pipeline. We anticipate that the net cost in 2015 here will be slightly higher than last year because of a full year of interest expense at NMGI. 
Although we won't be allocating interest expense to TECO Coal as we have in the past, the negative income -- the negative impact from that will be offset by the benefit of refinancing of 6 3/4% note maturity with $250 million of floating rate notes at a much lower interest cost.
With New Mexico Gas in our business mix, our quarterly earnings pattern will look different going forward. This slide shows the normal seasonal earnings pattern we expect from New Mexico Gas, a fairly normal pattern for a gas distribution system with significant residential heating load. It actually complements our existing earnings pattern nicely, contributing to higher first and fourth quarter earnings, while Tampa Electric's strongest quarters with summer air conditioning load will overlay the weaker quarters in New Mexico. As a result, the first quarter will now be one of our higher earnings quarters, and the second quarter our lowest. The third quarter, with the summer air conditioning load, is still expected to be our highest earnings quarter, and fourth quarter will now reflect the start of winter in New Mexico. 
Because completion of our Polk conversion project is an important component of our 2017 outlook, I want to provide a brief status on the construction activities you see here. In short, the project is on schedule and on budget. This is proven conventional technology, and the project's scope is actually smaller than the Bayside conversion project that we successfully completed on time and on budget in the 2003, 2004 timeframe. 
And I'll close with our upcoming investor communications schedule. We expect to file our 10-Q at the end of this week. We will be busy in May, starting with the Citi and Deutsche Bank conferences in the middle of the month, followed by the AGA conference the following week. And in June, we will make our annual trip to Toronto, and we'll meet with Canadian investors at the UBS conference. 
And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

As you recall on the afternoon of July 16, in response to the story that appeared on Sparks spread, we disclosed that TECO Energy is exploring strategic alternatives and that we have retained Morgan Stanley to advise on this matter. At that time, we stated the exploration was preliminary nature, and we would not update the process or have any additional announcements regarding the matter unless or until we were to enter into a binding definitive agreement with respect to a sale. Today, we have now additional comments to make on this matter and we'll not be addressing this during the question-and-answer session at the end of Sandy's prepared remarks. 
As you saw in our earnings release this morning, due to ongoing negotiations for the sale of TECO Coal and an expected adjustment to the value of that business based on potential sales prices, we're reporting results from continuing operations only this morning. We do not expect individual operating company results we are reporting today to change as a result of any evaluation adjustments that we make in our discontinued operations. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to cover the financial results for continuing operations. Sandy?"

Today's quarterly update will be normal in every way except that it will cover continuing operations only. In the second quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $61.9 million or $0.26 per share compared with $0.28 last y",1647,"Thank you, John. Today's quarterly update will be normal in every way except that it will cover continuing operations only. In the second quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $61.9 million or $0.26 per share compared with $0.28 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $61.5 million in 2015 and includes $400,000 of charges related to the New Mexico Gas integration. Results in the quarter reflected close to breakeven results in New Mexico Gas and the full impact of the 16.7 million shares we issued in July last year in connection with that acquisition. That share impact diluted earnings about $0.02 in the quarter. 
For the first 6 months of the year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $126.3 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with $0.51 last year. Net income from continuing operations for the 6 months was $125.3 million, compared with $110.7 million last year. Both years include cost associated with the New Mexico Gas acquisition, $1 million of integration costs in 2015 and $4.7 million of acquisition cost in 2014. 
Tampa Electric recorded higher net income in the second quarter, reflecting customer growth at a strong 1.8% and hot weather in April and May. We also had the second quarter effect of the base revenue increase that became effective November 1 of last year per Tampa Electric 2013 regulatory stipulation. 
With strong customer growth and better weather resulted in second quarter energy sales that was 6.6% higher than last year. 
AFUDC also increased this quarter, with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
Second quarter weather was a real positive. April and May were much hotter than normal, which boosted Tampa Electric Energy sales but hurt Peoples Gas slightly at the tail end of the heating season. Hot weather in April have the air conditioners running early in the season, driving energy sales up but not at the same magnitude that the cooling degree days were up. With the lower humidity and cooler nights, the high daytime temperatures we saw in April don't generate the same energy sales volumes as they would in the continuously hot and humid summer months when air conditioners stays around 24/7. 
Peoples Gas has seen quarter after quarter of accelerated customer growth. And the second quarter continued this trend, customer growth of 2.2%. Growth was strongest in the Southwest Florida market that has been the most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as the Northeast Florida and Jacksonville areas. We saw lower therm sales to residential and commercial customers due to warm April weather at the end of the heating season. But higher therms transported for power generation customers and higher system sales due to increased coal-to-gas switching as well as new generating facilities common online. 
On the expense side, O&M was lower than last year despite higher employee-related costs. 
The already strong local economy was enhanced this quarter by tourists enjoying the spring weather and the Tampa Bay Lightning's run to the Stanley Cup Finals. Indicative of this, hotels bed tax collections in the Tampa area were at record levels this quarter. And for the 9 months ended June 2015, were more than 15% higher than they were in 2014. 
Although the hockey fans here on the run with me this morning did not like the ultimate outcome, we did appreciate all of the Detroit, Montréal, New York and Chicago fans who visited Tampa this spring. 
New Mexico Gas Company achieved close to breakeven results in the second quarter and that's the quarter that typically produces a moderate loss. This outcome reflects the benefits of O&M improvement from integration synergies being realized and customer growth that reached 0.7% [ph] in the quarter. 
The other net segment, what we used to refer to as, had a higher net cost in the second quarter compared to last year as we expected. This was driven by interest expense of the intermediate parent of New Mexico Gas Company; and tax expense related to long-term incentive compensation shares that vested below target level. The impact of no longer allocating interest expense to TECO Coal following its classification as a discontinued operations, was offset by lower interest expense from our refinancing in the second quarter. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide, unemployment at the end of the second quarter was 5.5%, an improvement over [ph] 4% [ph] from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 266,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in trade transport and utilities, business services and education and health services. The biggest percentage gain again this quarter occurred in the construction sector, with the 6% employment gain. 
Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, once again outpaced the state and U.S. level, with unemployment down to 5.2%, almost a full percent below where it was a year ago. Over the past year, the Tampa's St. Petersburg area added 33,000 jobs, with the largest gains in leisure and hospitality, followed by education and health services. 
The unemployment rate in New Mexico was 6.4% in June, an improvement of 0.4% [ph] over a year ago. Not as dramatic as the improvements in Florida and the U.S, but, of course, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the peak level that we saw in Florida and nationally. 
Net job growth in New Mexico was 11,000 over the past year. A number impacted by some job losses in the oil and gas industry are the result of the recent weakness in energy prices. The largest gains in New Mexico's year-over-year job growth came in the education and health services, local government and professional and business services categories. 
Taxable sales, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continued to grow with a strong pace that was seen pretty consistently now over the last 4 years. Reflective of the strong tourist season, if you look at the graph in the appendix, you can see a very strong uptick in April of this year. 
On the housing front, the good story in Florida continues, with more than 5,500 new single-family building permits issued in Tampa Electric service territory over the past 12 months; and existing homes considering to sell at a very strong pace. 
The June Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.4% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to have dampened sales and the housing inventory remained at a healthy level of less than 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market has posted gains as well. In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily over the past year. There was a very strong acceleration in the past several months, including a 33% year-over-year increase in June. Selling prices have also trended up and the inventory of homes available for resale is currently about 5 months. You can see all of these trends on the graph in the appendix. 
Our assumptions around guidance that we've provided previously remain unchanged. We're maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11, excluding non-GAAP charges or gains. As a regulated utility company, weather is the biggest variable in our outlook, and we assume normal weather for all of our companies for the remainder of the year. That said, weather is other than normal, our operating companies have typically been very successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range. 
This slide is another graphical reminder that our quarterly earnings pattern will look different with New Mexico Gas Company in our business mix. I've shown the slide previously that illustrated the New Mexico has a very seasonal earnings pattern, with very strong earnings in the cold-weather first and fourth quarters, while the warmer second and third quarters typically produced losses. That's a fairly normal pattern for a gas distribution system with significant residential heating load. So as you can see in the pro forma illustrations here, we expect to see quarterly results meaningfully higher in the first and fourth quarters and somewhat lower than in the second and third quarters than they've been in the past. That actually results in less quarterly variation through the year than we've seen in the past as the New Mexico and Florida earnings patterns are quite complementary. 
Biggest completion of our Polk conversion project is a very important component of our 2017 outlook. I'll again provide a brief status on the construction activities you've seen here. In short, the project is on schedule and it's on budget. This has proven conventional technology and the project scope is smaller than the Bayside conversion project that we successfully completed in the 2003, 2004 time frame. 
This picture shows the progress we're making installing the heat recovery steam generators. This second picture gives you some idea of the size and scope of this $700 million project. You can see the fourth combustion turbine, 2 on either side of the steam turbine island that's located in the center of the picture. 
We will complete our reporting of second quarter results on or before August 7, when we will report full GAAP results including discontinued operations. 
Next Thursday, we will be ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark the 50th anniversary of our listing there. Other upcoming activities will include the Wolfe conference in New York and the European non-DoD Road Show in the fall. 
Before opening the lines for questions, I do want to reiterate John's opening message regarding our exploration of strategic alternatives. We have no additional comments to make on this matter and will not address any questions on the topic during the question-and-answer session. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

Today's quarterly update will be normal in every way except that it will cover continuing operations only. In the second quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $61.9 million or $0.26 per share compared with $0.28 last y",1646,"Thank you, John. Today's quarterly update will be normal in every way except that it will cover continuing operations only. In the second quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $61.9 million or $0.26 per share compared with $0.28 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $61.5 million in 2015 and includes $400,000 of charges related to the New Mexico Gas integration. Results in the quarter reflected close to breakeven results at New Mexico Gas and the full impact of the 16.7 million shares we issued in July last year in connection with that acquisition. That share impact diluted earnings about $0.02 in the quarter. 
For the first 6 months of the year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $126.3 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with $0.51 last year. Net income from continuing operations for the 6 months was $125.3 million, compared with $110.7 million last year. Both years include costs associated with the New Mexico Gas acquisition, $1 million of integration costs in 2015 and $4.7 million of acquisition costs in 2014. 
Tampa Electric recorded higher net income in the second quarter, reflecting customer growth at a strong 1.8% and hot weather in April and May. We also had the second quarter effect of the base revenue increase that became effective November 1 of last year per Tampa Electric 2013 regulatory stipulation. 
The strong customer growth and better weather resulted in second quarter energy sales that were 6.6% higher than last year. 
AFUDC also increased this quarter, with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
Second quarter weather was a real positive. April and May were much hotter than normal, which boosted Tampa Electric Energy sales but hurt Peoples Gas slightly at the tail end of the heating season. Hot weather in April have the air conditioners running early in the season, driving energy sales up, but not to the same magnitude as the cooling degree days were up. With the lower humidity and cooler nights, the high daytime temperatures we saw in April don't generate the same energy sales volumes as they would in the continuously hot and humid summer months when air conditioners seem to run 24/7. 
Peoples Gas has seen quarter-after-quarter of accelerating customer growth. And the second quarter continued this trend with customer growth of 2.2%. Growth was strongest in the Southwest Florida market that has been the most impacted in the economic downturn as well as the Northeast Florida and Jacksonville areas. We saw lower therm sales to residential and commercial customers due to warm April weather at the end of the heating season. But higher therms transported for power-generation customers and higher off-system sales due to increased coal-to-gas switching as well as new generating facilities coming online. 
On the expense side, O&M was lower than last year despite higher employee-related costs. 
The already strong local economy was enhanced this quarter by tourists enjoying the spring weather and the Tampa Bay Lightning's run to the Stanley Cup Finals. Indicative of this, hotel's bed tax collections in the Tampa area were at record levels this quarter, and for the 9 months ended June 2015, were more than 15% higher than they were in 2014. 
While the hockey fans here on the room with me this morning did not like the ultimate outcome, we did appreciate all of the Detroit, Montréal, New York and Chicago fans who visited Tampa this spring. 
New Mexico Gas Company achieved close to breakeven results in the second quarter, and that's the quarter that typically produces a moderate loss. This outcome reflects the benefits of O&M improvement from the integration synergies being realized and customer growth that reached 0.7% in the quarter. 
The other net segment, that we used to refer to as parent other, had a higher net cost in the second quarter compared to last year, as we expected. This was driven by interest expense at the intermediate parent of New Mexico Gas Company and tax expense related to long-term incentive compensation shares that vested below target level. The impact is no longer allocating interest expense to TECO Coal, following its classification as a discontinued operation, was offset by lower interest expense from a refinancing in the second quarter. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide, unemployment at the end of the second quarter was 5.5%, an improvement of a 4% from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 266,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in trade, transport and utilities, business services and education and health services. The biggest percentage gain again this quarter occurred in the construction sector, with a 6% employment gain. 
Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, once again outpaced the state and U.S. level, with unemployment down to 5.2%, almost to full percent below where it was a year ago. Over the past year, the Tampa's St. Petersburg area added 33,000 jobs, with the largest gains in leisure and hospitality, followed by education and health services. 
The unemployment rate in New Mexico was 6.4% in June, an improvement of 0.4% over a year ago, not as dramatic as the improvements in Florida and the U.S, but, of course, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the peak level that we saw in Florida and nationally. 
Net job growth in New Mexico was 11,000 over the past year, a number impacted by some job losses in the oil and gas industry, as a result of the recent weakness in energy prices. The largest gains in New Mexico's year-over-year job growth came in the education and health services, local government and professional and business services categories. 
Taxable sales, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continued to grow with the strong pace that we've seen pretty consistently now over the last 4 years. Reflective of the strong tourist season, if you look at the graph in the appendix, you can see a very strong uptick in April of this year. 
On the housing front, the good story in Florida continues, with more than 5,500 new single-family building permits issued in Tampa Electric service territory over the past 12 months, and existing homes continuing to sell at a very strong pace. 
The June Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.4% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remained at a healthy level of less than 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market has posted gains as well. In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily over the past year. There was a very strong acceleration in the past several months, including a 33% year-over-year increase in June. Selling prices have also trended up and the inventory of homes available for resale is currently about 5 months. You can see all of these trends on the graph in the appendix. 
Our assumptions around guidance, that we've provided previously, remain unchanged. We're maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11, excluding non-GAAP charges or gains. As a regulated utility company, weather is the biggest variable in our outlook, and we assume normal weather for all of our companies for the remainder of the year. That said, if weather is other than normal, our operating companies have typically been very successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range. 
This slide is another graphical reminder that our quarterly earnings pattern will look different with New Mexico Gas Company in our business mix. I've shown a slide previously that illustrated that New Mexico Gas has a very seasonal earnings pattern, with very strong earnings in the cold-weather first and fourth quarters, while the warmer second and third quarters typically produce losses. That's a fairly normal pattern for a gas distribution system with significant residential heating load. So as you can see in the pro forma illustration here, we would expect to see quarterly results meaningfully higher in the first and fourth quarters and somewhat lower in the second and third quarters than they've been in the past. That actually results in less quarterly variation through the year than we've seen in the past, as the New Mexico and Florida earnings patterns are quite complementary. 
Biggest completion of our Polk conversion project is a very important component of our 2017 outlook. I'll again provide a brief status on the construction activities you've seen here. In short, the project is on schedule and it's on budget. This is proven conventional technology and the project scope is smaller than the Bayside conversion project that we successfully completed in the 2003, 2004 time frame. 
This picture shows the progress we're making installing the heat recovery steam generators. This second picture gives you some idea of the size and scope of this $700-million project. You can see the fourth combustion turbine, 2 on either side of the steam turbine island that's located in the center of the picture. 
We will complete our reporting of second quarter results on or before August 7, when we will report full GAAP results including discontinued operations. 
Next Thursday, we will be ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark the 50th anniversary of our listing there. Other upcoming activities will include the Wolfe Conference in New York and the European non-deal roadshow in the fall.

Today's quarterly update will be normal in every way except that it will cover continuing operations only. In the second quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $61.9 million or $0.26 per share, compared with $0.28 last",1648,"Thank you, John. Today's quarterly update will be normal in every way except that it will cover continuing operations only. In the second quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $61.9 million or $0.26 per share, compared with $0.28 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $61.5 million in 2015 and includes $400,000 of charges related to the New Mexico Gas integration. Results in the quarter reflected close to breakeven results at New Mexico Gas and the full impact of the 16.7 million shares we issued in July last year in connection with that acquisition. That share impact diluted earnings about $0.02 in the quarter. 
For the first 6 months of the year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $126.3 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with $0.51 last year. Net income from continuing operations for the 6 months was $125.3 million, compared with $110.7 million last year. Both years include costs associated with the New Mexico Gas acquisition, $1 million of integration costs in 2015 and $4.7 million of acquisition costs in 2014. 
Tampa Electric recorded higher net income in the second quarter, reflecting customer growth at a strong 1.8% and hot weather in April and May. We also had the second quarter effect of the base revenue increase that became effective November 1 of last year per Tampa Electric's 2013 regulatory stipulation. 
The strong customer growth and better weather resulted in second quarter energy sales that were 6.6% higher than last year. 
AFUDC also increased this quarter, with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
Second quarter weather was a real positive. April and May were much hotter than normal, which boosted Tampa Electric's energy sales but hurt Peoples Gas slightly at the tail end of the heating season. Hot weather in April had the air conditioners running early in the season, driving energy sales up, but not to the same magnitude as the cooling degree days were up. With the lower humidity and cooler nights, the high daytime temperatures we saw in April don't generate the same energy sales volumes as they would in the continuously hot and humid summer months, when air conditioners seem to run 24/7. 
Peoples Gas has seen quarter-after-quarter of accelerating customer growth. And the second quarter continued this trend, with customer growth of 2.2%. Growth was strongest in the Southwest Florida market that has been the most impacted in the economic downturn, as well as the Northeast Florida and Jacksonville areas. We saw lower therm sales to residential and commercial customers, due to warm April weather at the end of the heating season. But higher therms transported for power-generation customers and higher off-system sales, due to increased coal-to-gas switching as well as new generating facilities coming online. 
On the expense side, O&M was lower than last year despite higher employee-related costs. 
The already strong local economy was enhanced this quarter by tourists enjoying the spring weather and the Tampa Bay Lightning's run to the Stanley Cup Finals. Indicative of this, hotels bed tax collections in the Tampa area were at record levels this quarter, and for the 9 months ended June 2015, were more than 15% higher than they were in 2014. 
While the hockey fans here in the room with me this morning did not like the ultimate outcome, we did appreciate all of the Detroit, Montréal, New York and Chicago fans who visited Tampa this spring. 
New Mexico Gas Company achieved close to breakeven results in the second quarter, and that's a quarter that typically produces a moderate loss. This outcome reflects the benefits of O&M improvement from the integration synergies being realized and customer growth that reached 0.7% in the quarter. 
The Other net segment, what we used to refer to as Parent Other, had a higher net cost in the second quarter compared to last year, as we expected. This was driven by interest expense at the intermediate parent of New Mexico Gas Company and tax expense related to long-term incentive compensation shares that vested below target level. The impact of no longer allocating interest expense to TECO Coal, following its classification as a discontinued operation, was offset by lower interest expense from a refinancing in the second quarter. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide, unemployment at the end of the second quarter was 5.5%, an improvement of a full percent from a year ago. At the same time, the state has added more than 266,000 new jobs over the past year, with the largest number of new jobs occurring in trade, transport and utilities, business services and education and health services. The biggest percentage gain again this quarter occurred in the construction sector, with a 6% employment gain. 
Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric's primary service territory, once again outpaced the state and U.S. level, with unemployment down to 5.2%, almost a full percent below where it was a year ago. Over the past year, the Tampa St. Petersburg area added 33,000 jobs, with the largest gains in leisure and hospitality, followed by education and health services. 
The unemployment rate in New Mexico was 6.4% in June, an improvement of 0.4% over a year ago, not as dramatic as the improvements in Florida and the U.S., but of course, the unemployment rate in New Mexico never came close to the peak level that we saw in Florida and nationally. 
Net job growth in New Mexico was 11,000 over the past year, a number impacted by some job losses in the oil and gas industry, as a result of the recent weakness in energy prices. The largest gains in New Mexico's year-over-year job growth came in the education and health services, local government and professional and business services categories. 
Taxable sales, both in Florida and in Hillsborough County, continued to grow with the strong pace that we've seen pretty consistently now over the last 4 years. Reflective of the strong tourist season, if you look at the graph in the appendix, you can see a very strong uptick in April of this year. 
On the housing front, the good story in Florida continues, with more than 5,500 new single-family building permits issued in Tampa Electric's service territory over the past 12 months, and existing homes continuing to sell at a very strong pace. 
The June Case-Shiller report showed that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.4% year-over-year, which doesn't seem to have dampened sales, and the housing inventory remains at a healthy level of less than 4 months. 
The New Mexico housing market has posted gains as well. In Albuquerque, the state's largest metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily over the past year. There was a very strong acceleration in the past several months, including a 33% year-over-year increase in June. Selling prices have also trended up and the inventory of homes available for resale is currently about 5 months. You can see all of these trends on the graph in the appendix. 
Our assumptions around guidance that we've provided previously remain unchanged. We're maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11, excluding non-GAAP charges or gains. As a regulated utility company, weather is the biggest variable in our outlook, and we assume normal weather for all of our companies for the remainder of the year. That said, if weather is other than normal, our operating companies have typically been very successful responding to weather variation within a reasonably normal range. 
This slide is another graphical reminder that our quarterly earnings pattern will look different with New Mexico Gas Company in our business mix. I've shown this slide previously that illustrated that New Mexico Gas has a very seasonal earnings pattern, with very strong earnings in the cold-weather first and fourth quarters, while the warmer second and third quarters typically produce losses. That's a fairly normal pattern for a gas distribution system with significant residential heating load. So as you can see in the pro forma illustration here, we would expect to see quarterly results meaningfully higher in the first and fourth quarters and somewhat lower in the second and third quarters than they've been in the past. That actually results in less quarterly variation through the year than we've seen in the past, as the New Mexico and Florida earnings patterns are quite complementary. 
Because completion of our Polk conversion project is a very important component of our 2017 outlook, I'll again provide a brief status on the construction activities you've seen here. In short, the project is on schedule and it's on budget. This is proven conventional technology and the project scope is smaller than the Bayside conversion project that we successfully completed in the 2003, 2004 time frame. 
This picture shows the progress we're making installing the heat recovery steam generators. This second picture gives you some idea of the size and scope of this $700 million project. You can see the 4 combustion turbines, 2 on either side of the steam turbine island that's located in the center of the picture. 
We will complete our reporting of second quarter results on or before August 7, when we will report full GAAP results including discontinued operations. 
Next Thursday, we will be ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark the 50th anniversary of our listing there. Other upcoming activities will include the Wolfe Conference in New York and a European non-deal roadshow in the fall.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll cover the status of various filings that we've made with Emera for approval of the acquisition, provide the normal quarterly update and confirm our 2015 outlook. The app",1626,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll cover the status of various filings that we've made with Emera for approval of the acquisition, provide the normal quarterly update and confirm our 2015 outlook. The appendix to the presentation contains the usual graph from the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP results. 
Since we announced the signing of the agreement with Emera in early September, we have been busy working with Emera to make the required filings in a timely manner. We filed with the FETC on October 6 and asked for approval by March. We filed with the New Mexico commission on October 19. The commission assigned a hearing examiner yesterday and we are waiting for a final order on that. Henceforth, scheduled the established payment proceedings. We filed an initial proxy with the SEC on October 6, and subsequently filed our final proxy on October 22, with a record date of October 21. 
We scheduled the special shareholders' meeting to vote on the approval of the merger for December 3. And over the next several weeks, we expect to make the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing and the filing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. 
In the third quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $77.3 million or $0.33 per share compared with $0.32 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $64.9 million in 2015, and that includes $12.4 million of charges, primarily associated with the pending acquisition by Emera. 
We closed the sale of TECO Coal this quarter, so I'm not including a report on discontinued operations in my quarterly update. There is a report on discontinued operations included in our earnings release. 
For the first 9 months of the year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $203.6 million or $0.87 per share compared with $0.84 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $190.2 million compared with $179 million last year. In addition to the cost of this year associated with the Emera transaction, both years include costs associated with the New Mexico Gas acquisition, $1.2 million integration cost in 2015 and $5.7 million of acquisition cost in 2014. 
Tampa Electric reported higher net income in the third quarter. Customer growth was a strong 1.8%, while energy sales was slightly lower than last year, reflecting degree days that were fairly normal but rainfall in July and August that was 60% above normal. Base revenues in the quarter benefited from increase that became effective November 1 of last year for the 2013 regulatory stipulation and AFUDC increased this quarter with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
Peoples Gas saw another quarter of 2% customer growth, again, with the strongest numbers in the Southwest and Northeast areas of the state. Both customer and economic growth contributed to higher therm sales to retail customers. Therms transported for power generation customers and all system sales were higher also, reflecting more coal to gas switching as well as new generating facilities coming online. 
The economy continues to do very well and it was helped in the first 9 months of the year by a very strong tourist industry that benefited from Chamber of Commerce weather, the hockey final and new international flights at Tampa International Airport. As an indicator of that, hotel bed tax election in the Tampa area set record in the fiscal year ended September 20, 2015, with numbers 13% higher than 2014, which also was a record year. 
New Mexico Gas Company recorded a seasonal loss in the third quarter, always the weakest revenue quarter because of the absence of heating load. Again, this quarter, we saw the positive impact on O&M, both from integration synergies being realized and an overall focus on cost reduction. Customer growth was worth 0.8% in the quarter and to provide some perspective on that, in the first full quarter that we owned the New Mexico Gas, which was the fourth quarter [ph] of last year, customer growth was half that at 0.4%. 
The other net segment, formerly known as Parent Other, adding net cost in the third quarter but was lower compared to last year due to some unfavorable tax items that were in 2014. Results also reflect the interest expense at New Mexico Gas intermediate, the parent of New Mexico Gas Company. And we only had 1 month of that interest in the 2014 period. And finally, the lower interest expense from a refinancing earlier this year more than offset the impact of no longer allocating interest expense to TECO Coal. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide unemployment at the end of the third quarter was 5.2%, down from 5.8% a year ago, and over that period, the state has added more than 236,000 new jobs. [indiscernible] Tampa Electric primary service territory, once again outpaced the state and U.S. levels, with unemployment down to 4.8%, a full percent below where it was a year ago. 
Over the past year, the Tampa state [indiscernible] served area added more than 28,000 jobs. A nice development in the local employment picture is an increase in the number of higher-paying science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM jobs, in the Tampa Bay Area. According to a Bloomberg study, Tampa has more than 64,000 STEM jobs, representing more than 5% of the workforce, and that is the highest number and percentage among Florida's major metropolitan areas. 
Growth in construction-related jobs in Tampa is being driven by record numbers and record value for building permits. In the 2015 fiscal year that just ended, the city of Tampa issued more than 23,000 building permits, single-family, multifamily and commercial, both new construction and modification, with a value of $2.4 billion. Those numbers represent a 20% increase from 2014, which also was a record year. Aggressive economic development efforts has [indiscernible] almost 12,000 new jobs to the area over the past 3 years, including a number of higher-paying professional and high-tech jobs. 
In New Mexico, the unemployment rate never came close to the level we saw in Florida because of the large presence of the oil and gas industry and governmental facilities in the state. Improvement, though, has been lower than what we've experienced in Florida and in September, the unemployment rate ticked up, primarily due to a slowdown in construction employment. 
Net job growth in New Mexico was 6,400 over the past year, a number impacted by some job losses in the oil and gas industry as a result of the recent looseness [ph] in energy prices. The largest gain came in education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business service categories. The Albuquerque area, which constitutes almost 50% of the state nonforeign payroll, led the state in job creation, adding 6,600 jobs over the year and offsetting net job losses in some of the less probable areas. 
On the housing front, the good story in the Tampa area continues, with more than 5,800 new single-family building permits issued over the past 12 months, and increasing homes continuing to sell at a strong pace. The October Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.1% year-over-year. With a strong pace of resale, the housing inventory remains at a healthy level of less than 4 months. 
In Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest Metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily over the past year. There was a very strong acceleration in recent months including a 33% year-over-year increase in June, and 26% in September. Selling prices have also trended up in the inventory of homes available for resale or just under 5 months. 
You can see all of these trends on the graph in the appendix. Our assumptions around guidance that we've provided previously remain unchanged. We are maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015, earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11 excluding non-GAAP charges or  gain [ph]. We still expect New Mexico Gas to be accretive to our full year earnings but it has been a challenge to overcome the very mild winter weather that started the year. We had great results on the cost side and that is helping to offset the impact of disappointing first quarter weather, but we do need some normal cold winter weather to close that year. 
Looking forward to next year. All indications are that we should continue to see strong customer growth at all 3 of the utilities. We expect the Florida utilities to earn toward the upper end of the expected return on equity ranges shown on the slide. 
Tampa Electric AFUDC earnings will grow next year as the investment in the Polk conversion project reaches its peak. And in addition, a $5 million base revenue increase became effective November 1 of this year as a result of the 2013 settlement agreement. 
All of utilities expect to record higher depreciation expense as a result of continued investment in equipment and facilities to serve customers. And of course, across the board, we will continue to be very focused on holding the lines on cost. 
Our upcoming investor communications schedule includes being at EEI next week where we will participate jointly with Emera and one-on-one meetings and also will be a part of Emera's presentation at 10:30 on Tuesday morning. 
After the Emera acquisition announcement, we've been asked if we would continue to have quarterly conference calls. Because of the timing of EEI next week and our activity there, we decided to have a call this quarter, but future calls will be on an as-needed basis only. 
And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the line for the questions. Thank you."

There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we'll discuss today. For a more complete discussion of these factors, we refer you to the risk factor discussion on our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, and as updated in subsequent SEC filings. 
In the course of today's presentation, we will be using non-GAAP results. There is a reconciliation between these non-GAAP measures and the closest GAAP measure in the appendix to today's presentation. 
The host for our call today is Sandy Callahan, TECO Energy's Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is John Ramil's -- John Ramil, TECO Energy's CEO.

This morning, I'll cover the status of various filings that we've made with Emera for approval of the acquisition, provide a normal quarterly update and confirm our 2015 outlook. The appendix to the presentation contains the usual graph from the Florida and New Mexico economies and reconciliations of non-GAAP results. 
Since we announced the signing of the agreement with Emera in early September, we have been busy working with Emera to make the required filings in a timely manner. We filed with the FERC on October 6 and asked for approval by March. We filed with the New Mexico Commission on October 19. The commission assigned a hearing examiner yesterday and we are waiting for a final order on that, and for  [ph] schedules we established in the proceedings. We filed an initial proxy with the SEC on October 6, and subsequently filed our final proxy on October 22, with a record date of October 21. 
We scheduled a special shareholder meeting to vote on the approval of the merger for December 3. And over the next several weeks, we expect to make the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing and the filing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. 
In the third quarter, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $77.3 million or $0.33 per share compared with $0.32 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $64.9 million in 2015, and that includes $12.4 million of charges, primarily associated with the pending acquisition by Emera. 
We closed the sale of TECO Coal this quarter, so I'm not including a report on discontinued operations in my quarterly update. There is a report on discontinued operations included in our earnings release. 
For the first 9 months of the year, non-GAAP results from continuing operations were $203.6 million or $0.87 per share compared with $0.84 last year. Net income from continuing operations was $190.2 million compared with $179 million last year. In addition to the cost this year associated with the Emera transaction, both years include costs associated with the New Mexico Gas acquisition; $1.2 million integration cost in 2015; and $5.7 million of acquisition cost in 2014. 
Tampa Electric reported higher net income in the third quarter. Customer growth was a strong 1.8%, while energy sales was slightly lower than last year, reflecting degree days that were fairly normal but rainfall in July and August that was 60% above normal. Base revenues in the quarter benefited from the increase that became effective November 1 of last year for the 2013 regulatory stipulation and AFUDC increased this quarter with higher investment balances in the Polk conversion project and other qualified projects. 
Peoples Gas saw another quarter of 2% customer growth, again with the strongest numbers in the southwest and northeast areas of the state. Both customer and economic growth contributed to higher therm sales to retail customers. Sales to transported power generation customers and off-system sales were higher also, reflecting more coal to gas switching as well as new generating facilities coming online. 
The local economy continues to do very well and it was helped in the first 9 months of the year by a very strong tourist industry that benefited from Chamber of Commerce, weather, the hockey finals and new international flights at Tampa International Airport. As an indicator of that, hotel bed tax collections in the Tampa area set record in the fiscal year ended September 20, 2015, with numbers 13% higher than 2014, which also was a record year. 
New Mexico Gas Company recorded a seasonal loss in the third quarter, always the weakest revenue quarter because of the absence of heating load. Again, this quarter, we saw the positive impact on O&M, both from integration synergies being realized and an overall focus on cost reduction. Customer growth was worth 0.8% in the quarter. And to provide some perspective on that, in the first full quarter that we owned New Mexico Gas, which was the fourth quarter of last year, customer growth was 1/2 that at 0.4%. 
The other net segment, formerly known as parent other, adding net cost in the third quarter that was lower compared to last year due to some unfavorable tax items that were in 2014. Results also reflect the interest expense at New Mexico Gas Intermediate, the parent of New Mexico Gas Company. And we only had 1 month of that interest in the 2014 period. And finally, the lower interest expense from a refinancing earlier this year more than offset the impact of no longer allocating interest expense to TECO Coal. 
The Florida economy continues to be a good story. Statewide unemployment at the end of the third quarter was 5.2%, down from 5.8% a year ago. And over that period, the state has added more than 236,000 new jobs. Hillsborough County, Tampa Electric primary service territory, once again outpaced the state and U.S. levels, with unemployment down to 4.8%, a full percent below where it was 1 year ago.  
Over the past year, the Tampa St. Petersburg area added more than 28,000 jobs. A nice development in the local employment picture is an increase in the number of higher-paying science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM jobs, in the Tampa Bay Area.  According to a Bloomberg study, Tampa has more than 64,000 STEM jobs, representing more than 5% of the workforce, and that is the highest number and percentage among Florida's major metropolitan areas. 
Growth in construction-related jobs in Tampa is being driven by record numbers and record value for building permits. In the 2015 fiscal year that just ended, the City of Tampa issued more than 23,000 building permits, single-family, multifamily and commercial, both new construction and modification, with a value of $2.4 billion. Those numbers represent a 20% increase from 2014, which also was a record year. Aggressive economic development efforts has brought almost 12,000 new jobs to the area over the past 3 years, including a number of higher-paying professional and high-tech jobs. 
In New Mexico, the unemployment rate never came close to the levels we saw in Florida because of the large presence of the oil and gas industries and governmental facilities in the state. Improvement, though, has been slower than what we've experienced in Florida. And in September, the unemployment rate ticked up, primarily due to a slowdown in construction employment. 
Net job growth in New Mexico was 6,400 over the past year, a number impacted by some job losses in the oil and gas industry as a result of the recent weakness in energy prices. The largest gain came in at education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business service categories. 
The Albuquerque area, which constitutes almost 50% of the state's non-farm payroll, led the state in job creation, adding 6,600 jobs over the year and offsetting net job losses in some of the less populous areas. 
On the housing front, the good story in the Tampa area continues, with more than 5,800 new single-family building permits issued over the past 12 months, and existing homes continuing to sell at a strong pace. The October Case-Shiller report shows that selling prices in the Tampa market increased 6.1% year-over-year. With a strong pace of resale, the housing inventory remains at a healthy level of less than 4 months. 
In Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest Metro area, existing home resales have trended up steadily over the past year. There was a very strong acceleration in recent months, including a 33% year-over-year increase in June, and 26% in September. Selling prices have also trended up and the inventory of homes available for resale is just under 5 months.  You can see all of these trends on the graph in the appendix. 
Our assumptions around guidance that we've provided previously remain unchanged. We are maintaining our previously provided guidance for 2015, earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $1.08 to $1.11 excluding non-GAAP charges or gains.
We still expect New Mexico Gas to be accretive to our full year earnings but it has been a challenge to overcome the very mild winter weather that started the year. We've had great results on the cost side and that is helping to offset the impact of disappointing first quarter weather but we do need some normal cold winter weather to close out the year. 
Looking forward to next year, all indications are that we should continue to see strong customer growth at all 3 of the utilities. We expect the Florida utilities to earn toward the upper end of the respected return on equity ranges shown on the slide. 
Tampa Electric AFUDC earnings will grow next year as the investment in the Polk conversion project reaches its peak. And in addition, a $5 million base revenue increase became effective November 1 of this year as a result of the 2013 settlement agreement. 
All of the utilities expect to record higher depreciation expense as a result of continued investment in equipment and facilities to serve customers. And of course, across the board, we'll continue to be very focused on holding the lines on cost. 
Our upcoming investor communications schedule includes being at EEI next week where we will participate jointly with Emera in one-on-one meetings and also we'll be a part of Emera's presentation at 10:30 on Tuesday morning. 
After the Emera acquisition announcement, we've been asked if we would continue to have quarterly conference calls. Because of the timing of EEI next week and our activities there, we decided to have a call this quarter but future calls will be on an as-needed basis only. 
And now I will turn it over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Thank you."
