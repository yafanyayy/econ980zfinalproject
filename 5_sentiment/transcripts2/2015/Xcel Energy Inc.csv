I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014. And update you on some exciting developments that Xcel.

I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014. And update you on some exciting developments that Xcel. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items.
2014 was another strong year for Xcel Energy, as the company recorded earnings of $2.03 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive year we've met or exceeded our earnings guidance. And is fifth consecutive year we've delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range.  In addition, we raised our dividend for the 11th year on a row.
From a regulatory perspective, we made significant progress up rate cases at Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas. We received a constructive ALJ recommendation in Minnesota. And most recently, reached a favorable 3-year settlement in our Colorado electric case. When we filed the case in Colorado, we stated that our objective was to establish a multiyear regulatory plan that provides certainty for and its customers. This settlement accomplishes that goal, and provides us a reasonable opportunity to earn our authorized return in our Colorado elected business over the next 3 years.
From an operational perspective, I also wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the efforts of our employees this year. We have record levels of safety in 2014, improving for the seventh straight year. And again, we demonstrated our top-tier operating performance with industry-leading reliabilities scores.
Recall last quarter, we unveiled our refresh strategic plan that was focused on improving utility performance, including the goal of closing the ROE gap by 50 basis points, and increasing the amount of revenue generated from long-term regulatory agreement.  Driving operational excellence by focusing on limiting annual increases and O&M cost of between 0% and 2%. Providing our customers more options and solutions, and finally, investing for the future by focusing on incremental growth opportunities in our natural gas and transmission businesses.
Today, we're excited to update you on our progress we've made on some of these initiatives. The electric utility industry is in the midst of a major transition, and we're committed to being on the front end of this change. We will be a leader in the same way we proactively implemented our environmental strategy over a decade ago.
To this end, we are pursuing regulatory changes to better align with the clear direction that customer preferences, federal policies and state initiatives are moving. Last one, in Minnesota, a collaborative report was issued by a diverse stakeholder group known as the E21 initiative. The group released a set of recommendations that are to act as a blueprint for a new customer centric performance based regulatory approach.
Following E21 report, we filed with the Minnesota Commission, a framework on how we envision enabling these changes. We focused on 4 key objectives. Lowering carbon emission by 40% by 2030; pioneer in distribution grid monetization; responding to changing customer preferences and providing new services and products. And finally, pursuing more predictable and nimble rate recovery.
In order to effectively bring about these changes, it is essential to the company have a longer-term more holistic regulatory compact. Longer term multiyear agreements and additional writers are expected to improve visibility and supplement our efforts. Further, the company has tools that the unutilized stabilize rate increases and make more printable for our customers. We expect to work with the commission and various stakeholders in Minnesota in 2015. We've developed this new framework and have requested a planning meeting in the coming months to discuss options in greater detail.
We're also exploring ways for us to avoid the need to file a 2016 rate case, which will allow more time to concentrate on the longer-term regulatory framework.
In January, we filed our resource plan in Minnesota, which provides details on how we will achieve our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This will be accomplished by significantly increasing the amount of solar and wind on the NSP system. Adding natural gas generation, continuing our industry-leading commitment to conservation programs, operating our nuclear plants at least through their current licenses, and continue to run units 1 and 2 with gradual decrease reliance from those units through 2030.
This proactive, no regrets strategy will better position the company and our customers for the long run, and do so at an incremental cost of less than 3% through 2030. As a result, by 2030, 63% of our energy will be carbon free at NSP. Clearly, 2015 is going to be a transformational year in Minnesota.
While much of our discussion is focused on Minnesota, we are also pursuing changes in our Texas jurisdiction. Along with other non- utilities, we will be sponsoring legislation this session that will help reduce regulatory lag, and allow us to continue to invest in the systems to support growth in the region, which is continuing even in the phase of a challenging oil price environment.
Finally, we wanted to update you on our natural gas growth initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to file a general rate case for our Colorado gas business. Finally will include a number of investments to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.
Concurrent with our rate case, we will begin working with our commission and major stakeholders to explore rate basing natural gas reserves, as a weighted took advantage of the current low natural gas price and to provide a longer-term hedge for our customers. Following our stakeholders and outreach and education, we expect to make a separate filing to begin the regulatory process. We're excited by the progress we've made in the steps we've taken thus far. And I look forward to updating you later this year.
So with that I'll turn the call over to Theresa."
527542,281154040,751250,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full-year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.The most signi",1497,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full-year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.
The most significant driver us to 2014 earnings was improved electric and natural gas margins that benefited from new rates and increased rider revenues in many of our jurisdictions. Increased margin more than offset and unfavorable weather comparison and higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. It is worth noting that the weather in 2014 contributed $0.03 per share when compared to normal. In contrast, in 2013, weather contributed $0.11 per share, resulting in a $0.08 per share decline when comparing the 2 years.
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories.
We experienced positive growth trends in 2014 with weather normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.3% and firm natural gas sales improving 4.6%. Sales in 2014 exceeded our original expectations for the year. While we are monitoring economic conditions in our service territories, and are closely watching potential implications from changes in the space, we remain confident in our 2015 electric weather adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%.
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather adjusted retail sales increased 3.3% in 2014, due to strengthen C&I sales from growth in the sand mining industry and related oil and gas businesses. Customer growth and modest usage increases drove higher residential sales. Electric sales at SPS increased to 2.3% driven by growth in the C&I
Oil and gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory. And we saw additional growth in uranium and Richmond. While we are watching oil price closely and expect some producers to reduce new drilling activity, we anticipate that others will continue to grow production.
PSCo sales increased 1.2%, which was primarily attributable to strengthen the C&I class due to new food manufacturing customers and energy sector growth. Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased 0.06% driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and usage increases in the small C&I class.
Economic conditions remained strong across Xcel Energy service territories relative to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our regions of 3.6% remains well below the national average of 5.4%. In addition, the number of jobs in our regions grew 2.3% during 2014, compared with 1.9% for the nation.
Focusing more specifically on 2014 earnings, ongoing electric margin increased $215 million. Key drivers included, implementation of final and interim rates, which increased margin by $129 million; nonfuel riders increased margin by $57 million, increased transmission investments, which improved margin by $31 million; and retail sales growth excluding weather improved margins by $24 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year at $60 million, as well as a few other items.
The electric margin results reflect an estimated obligation for the Minnesota rate case, which is relatively consistent with the recent ALJ recommendation, and an estimated customer refund liability to capture the impact of our electric earnings test at PSCo.
Margins on the natural gas side of the business increased by $49 million for the year. This is primarily due to rate release in Colorado, significant infrastructure investment that is captured in an annual rider and retail sales growth.
O&M expenses increased $61 million or 2.7% for 2014. Solidly within our original guidance of 2% to 3% increase. The increase is primarily driven by higher, although, moderating nuclear costs. As we have discussed in the past, a key objective of our operational excellence strategic pillar is to limit O&M increases. We are reaffirming our 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2% consistent with our long-term objective.
In addition, I think it's worth mentioning that our 2015 O&M guidance assumption reflects a lower pension discount rate, and adoption of the recently updated mortality table.
Finally, other increased about $45 million or 11%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota, Texas and Colorado.
Next I'll update you on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we are pleased to have reached a settlement with parties that were successfully resolved our electric rate case. The agreement continues to productive multi-year regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012.  The settlement costs for a total increase of about $53 million or 1.9%, based on an ROE of 9.83%, and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we anticipate that PSCo will differ about the $3 million of expenses in 2015.
The agreement also stipulates that the clean air, clean jobs and transmission riders are forward-looking mechanisms.
It is worth noting then in our original Colorado rate case we had proposed shortening the depreciable life of certain assets, which would have led to a material increase in depreciation expense.  As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not be implementing the depreciation changes, and will avoid this incremental depreciation expense. Alternately, we agreed to file a standalone depreciation study early next year that will be Incorporated into our next rate care anticipated in 2018.
That commission is expected to rule out settlement in the first quarter, and rates are expected to be come effective in mid February.
Last month, we received the ALJ recommendation in our Minnesota electric case. We were encouraged by the -- that they judge acknowledged the strength of the company's position on many of the key issues, including pensions, benefits and depreciation.
When including the ALJ's recommended ROE of 9.77%, and adjusting for sales and property tax we estimate accumulative revenue increase of about $192 million for 2014 and 2015. Deliberations are currently scheduled from March.
Turning to our prudence review, we have not yet received the ALJ recommendation. We believe the delay is related to work load issues for the ALJ and anticipate the ALJ recommendation in February.
We continue to believe that we acted prudently in making decisions throughout the course of the project. In addition, the surrounding communities and our customers have a largely rebuild, safe and efficient source of carbon-free low-cost power for many years to come. Importantly, we don't believe that the delay in receiving the ALJ's recommendation will impact the current schedule, and we continue to expect the commission to on the proceeding in March.
In Texas, we filed a rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of $65 million or 6.7%. Our filings reflects the inclusion of rate base additions, once of the items we're seeking legislative support for in Texas. New rates are expected to be implemented by mid-year. In South Dakota, we put interim rates for about $16 million in place on January 1, and continue to work through the regulatory process. Final rates are expected to be approved mid-year.
We also made progress on several other initiatives during the fourth quarter. In Wisconsin, the commission approved the settlement improvements, which we reached last year with staff and interveners for rate increase of $14 million or 2.2%. Rates went into effect earlier this month.
In Texas, the commission approved our settlement in the 2014 rate case, providing incremental revenue of $37 million or 3.5%. Rates went into effect retroactive to June 2014.
Finally, in Minnesota, the commission approved our gas infrastructure writer for $15 million with rates becoming effective in February 2015.
In summary, 2014 was a busy and productive year for us on the regulatory front. This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of these assumptions have changed due primarily to incorporating actual 2014 results.
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. After a solid 2014, we're pleased to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our 5-year capital plan of $14.5 billion, and our 4.7% rate base CAGR, even when considering the impacts from the recently passed depreciation legislation.
We continue to see improved economic conditions in our regions, and experienced better than expected sales growth. With 2014 weather adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.3%, and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.6%. We are making meaningful progress on the regulatory front, including the recent multiyear settlement in Colorado, and expect to reach a conclusion in the Minnesota case in the next few months.
We delivered 2014 O&M expense growth within our guidance of 2% to 3% and continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to 2%.
And finally, we are well-positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6%, annually.
So with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

Your question was about transcos and transmission. Well, keep in mind that, $4.5 billion of our CapEx over the next 5 years is in transmission. None of it is in the transco or -- and none of it assumes that we win any of the competitive transmission projects. So when you look that what's come out of and the ITP 10 plan? I think it was about $300-odd million of potential opportunities. By the way, it looks like a -- not an incident the amount of that would go into the -- to SPS.

I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014, and update you on some exciting developments Xcel Energy. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items.
2014 was another strong year for Xcel Energy, as the company recorded earnings of $2.03 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive year we've met or exceeded our earnings guidance. And a fifth consecutive year we've delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range.  In addition, we raised our dividend for the 11th year on a row.
From a regulatory perspective, we made significant progress wrapping rate cases at Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas. We received a constructive ALJ recommendation in Minnesota. And most recently, reached a favorable 3-year settlement in our Colorado Electric case. When we filed the case in Colorado, we stated that our objective was to establish a multiyear regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. This settlement accomplishes that goal, and provides us a reasonable opportunity to earn our authorized return in our Colorado Electric business over the next 3 years.
From an operational perspective, I also wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the efforts of our employees this year. We hit record levels of safety in 2014, improving for the seventh straight year. And again, we demonstrated our top-tier operating performance with industry-leading reliabilities scores.
Recall last quarter, we unveiled our refresh strategic plan that was focused on improving utility performance, including the goal of closing the ROE gap by 50 basis points, and increasing the amount of revenue generated from long-term regulatory agreements.  Driving operational excellence by focusing on limiting annual increases and O&M cost of between 0% and 2%. Providing our customers more options and solutions. And finally, investing for the future by focusing on incremental growth opportunities in our natural gas and transmission businesses.
Today, we're excited to update you on the progress we've made on some of these initiatives. The electric utility industry is in the midst of a major transition, and we're committed to being on the front end of this change. We will be a leader in the same way we proactively implemented our environmental strategy over a decade ago.
To this end, we are pursuing regulatory changes to better align with a clear direction that customer preferences, federal policies and state initiatives are moving. Last month, in Minnesota, a collaborative report was issued by a diverse stakeholder group known as the e21 Initiative. The group released a set of recommendations that are intended to act as a blueprint for a new customer-centric, performance-based regulatory approach.
Following e21 report, we filed with the Minnesota Commission a framework on how we envision enabling these changes. We focused on 4 key objectives: lowering carbon emission by 40% by 2030; pioneering in distribution grid monetization; responding to changing customer preferences and providing new services and products; and finally, pursuing more predictable and nimble rate recovery.
In order to effectively bring about these changes, it is essential that the company have a longer-term, more holistic regulatory compact. Longer-term, multiyear agreements and additional writers are expected to improve visibility and supplement our efforts. Further, the company has tools that can utilize to stabilize rate increases and make bills more printable for our customers. We expect to work with the commission and various stakeholders in Minnesota in 2015 who developed this new framework and have requested a planning meeting in the coming months to discuss potential options in greater detail.
We're also exploring ways for us to avoid the need to file a 2016 rate case, which will allow more time to concentrate on the longer-term regulatory framework.
In January, we filed our resource plan in Minnesota, which provides details on how we will achieve our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This will be accomplished by significantly increasing the amount of solar and wind on the NSP system. Adding natural gas generation, continuing our industry-leading commitment to conservation programs, operating our nuclear plants at least through their current licenses, and continuing to run Sherco units 1 and 2 with gradual decreased reliance on those units through 2030.
This proactive, no-regret strategy will better position the company and our customers for the long run, and do so at an incremental cumulative cost of less than 3% through 2030. As a result, by 2030, 63% of our energy will be carbon-free at NSP. Clearly, 2015 is going to be a transformational year in Minnesota.
While much of our discussion is focused on Minnesota, we're also pursuing changes in our Texas jurisdiction. Along with other non-ERCOT utilities, we will be sponsoring legislation this session that will help reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to invest in a system to support growth in the region, which is continuing even in the phase of a challenging oil price environment.
Finally, we wanted to update you on our natural gas growth initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to file a general rate case for our Colorado gas business. The filing will include a number of investments to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.
Concurrent with our rate case, we will begin working with our commission and major stakeholders to explore rate-basing natural gas reserves as a way to take advantage of the current low natural gas price and to provide a longer-term hedge for our customers. Following our stakeholder and outreach and education, we expect to make a separate filing to begin the regulatory process. We're excited by the progress we've made and the steps we've taken thus far, and I look forward to updating you later this year.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa."
527542,281154040,751594,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full-year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share, compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.The most sign",1505,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full-year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share, compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.
The most significant driver related to 2014 earnings was improved electric and natural gas margins that benefited from new rate and increased rider revenues in many of our jurisdictions. Increased margins more than offset an unfavorable weather comparison and higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. It is worth noting that the weather in 2014 contributed $0.03 per share when compared to normal. In contrast, in 2013, weather contributed $0.11 per share, resulting in a $0.08 per share decline when comparing the 2 years.
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. We experienced positive growth trends in 2014 with weather-normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.3% and firm natural gas sales improving 4.6%. Sales in 2014 exceeded our original expectations for the year. While we are monitoring economic conditions in our service territories and are closely watching potential implications from changes in the E&P space, we remain confident in our 2015 electric weather-adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%.
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 3.3% in 2014, due to strengthened C&I sales from growth in the sand mining industry and related oil and gas businesses. Customer growth and modest usage increases drove higher residential sales. Electric sales at SPS increased to 2.3% driven by growth in the C&I class.
Oil and gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory, and we saw additional growth in uranium enrichment. While we are watching the oil price closely and expect some producers to reduce new drilling activity, we anticipate that others will continue to grow production.
PSCo sales increased 1.2%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class due to new food manufacturing customers and energy sector growth. Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased 0.6% driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers, and usage increases in the small C&I class.
Economic conditions remained strong across Xcel Energy service territories relative to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our regions of 3.6% remains well below the national average of 5.4%. In addition, the number of jobs in our regions grew 2.3% during 2014, compared with 1.9% for the nation.
Focusing more specifically on 2014 earnings, ongoing electric margin increased $215 million. Key drivers included: implementation of final and interim rates, which increased margin by $129 million; nonfuel riders increased margin by $57 million, increased transmission investment, which improved margin by $31 million; and retail sales growth, excluding weather, improved margins by $24 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $60 million, as well as a few other items.
The electric margin results reflect an estimated refund obligation for the Minnesota rate case, which is relatively consistent with the recent ALJ recommendation; and an estimated customer refund liability to capture the impact of our electric earnings test at PSCo.
Margins on the natural gas side of the business increased by $49 million for the year. This is primarily due to rate release in Colorado, significant infrastructure investment that is captured in an annual rider and retail sales growth.
O&M expenses increased $61 million or 2.7% for 2014, solidly within our original guidance of 2% to 3% increase. The increase is primarily driven by higher, although moderating, nuclear costs. As we have discussed in the past, a key objective of our operational excellence strategic pillar is to limit O&M increases. We are reaffirming our 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2%, consistent with our long-term objective.
In addition, I think it's worth mentioning that our 2015 O&M guidance assumption reflects a lower pension discount rate and adoption of the recently updated mortality table. Finally, other [ph] taxes increased about $45 million or 11%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota, Texas and Colorado.
Next I'll update you on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we're pleased to have reached a settlement with parties that would successfully resolve our electric rate case. The agreement continues the productive, multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. The settlement calls for a total increase of about $53 million or 1.9%, based on an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we anticipate that PSCo will differ about $3 million of expenses in 2015. The agreement also stipulates that both the clean air, clean jobs and transmission riders are forward-looking mechanisms.
It is worth noting that in our original Colorado rate case we had proposed shortening the depreciable life of certain assets, which would have led to a material increase in depreciation expense.  As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not be implementing the depreciation changes and will avoid this incremental depreciation expense. Alternatively, we agreed to file a standalone depreciation study early next year that will be incorporated into our next rate care anticipated in 2018. The commission is expected to rule out a settlement in the first quarter and rates are expected to be come effective in mid-February.
Last month, we received the ALJ recommendation in our Minnesota electric case. We were encouraged by the -- that they judge acknowledged the strength of the company's position on many of the key issues, including pension, benefits and depreciation. When including the ALJ's recommended ROE of 9.77% and adjusting for sales and property tax troughs, we estimate accumulative revenue increase of about $192 million for 2014 and 2015. Deliberations are currently scheduled for March.
Turning to our Monticello Prudence review, we have not yet received the ALJ recommendation. We believe the delay is related to work load issues for the ALJ and anticipate the ALJ recommendation in February. We continue to believe that we acted prudently in making decisions throughout the course of the project. In addition, the surrounding communities and our customers have a largely rebuilt, safe and efficient source of carbon-free, low-cost power for many years to come. Importantly, we don't believe that the delay in receiving the ALJ's recommendation will impact the current schedule, and we continue to expect the commission to deliberate on the proceeding in March.
In Texas, we filed a rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of $65 million or 6.7%. Our filing reflects the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions, one of the items we are seeking legislative support for in Texas. New rates are expected to be implemented by mid-year. In South Dakota, we put interim rates of about $16 million in place on January 1, and continue to work through the regulatory process. Final rates are expected to be approved mid-year.
We also made progress on several other initiatives during the fourth quarter. In Wisconsin, the commission approved the settlement agreement, which we reached last year with staff and intervenors for a rate increase of $14 million or 2.2%. Rates went into effect earlier this month.
In Texas, the commission approved our settlement in the 2014 rate case, providing incremental revenue of $37 million or 3.5%. Rates went into effect retroactive to June 2014.
Finally, in Minnesota, the commission approved our gas infrastructure writer for $15 million with rates becoming effective in February 2015. In summary, 2014 was a busy and productive year for us on the regulatory front.
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed due primarily to incorporating actual 2014 results.
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. After a solid 2014, we are pleased to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, our 5-year capital plan of $14.5 billion and our 4.7% rate base CAGR, even when considering the impacts from the recently passed bonus depreciation legislation.
We continue to see improved economic conditions in our regions, and experienced better-than-expected sales growth, with 2014 weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.3% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.6%. We are making meaningful progress on the regulatory front, including the recent multiyear settlement in Colorado, and expect to reach a conclusion in the Minnesota case in the next few months.
We delivered 2014 O&M expense growth within our guidance of 2% to 3% and continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to 2%.
And finally, we are well-positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually.
So with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

It doesn't mean we can't do something before that. But as you know, renewables are heavily driven by tax appetites, and you need one to efficiently -- it doesn't mean you're fully precluded, but to efficiently participate in those markets. Your question was about transcos and transmission. Well, keep in mind that $4.5 billion of our CapEx over the next 5 years is in transmission. None of it is in the transco or -- and none of it assumes that we win any of the competitive transmission projects. So when you look at what's come out of SPP and their ITP10 plan, I think it was about $300-odd million of potential opportunities. By the way, it looks like a -- not an insignificant amount of that would go into the -- to SPS. But we don't have -- that does not impact. That would be the icing on the cake. So our strategy is always been two prong. We have the utility vehicle to invest in, that's where we are today. We're in the process of getting approvals, final approvals on our transco, so that we can participate in those competitive markets. I think we're well-positioned to do that.

So the resource plan we went out further, here is what we can do by 2030. Here's how we get there. Let's focus on the key objective, which is carbon reduction. Let's be very disciplined about how we achieve that carbon reduction using what, we like to call, technologies at the speed of value. So disciplined on how we approach it. And let's make sure that our regulatory compact reflects that longer-term view. So yes, we outline general frameworks. But generally, what we're looking for is longer-term regulatory compacts. We'd like to see compacts 3, 4, maybe even up to 5 years long. And within -- in that, things you can augment that with riders, you could use [indiscernible] recovery-type mechanisms, and then have the incentives for achieving what I think the state wants us to achieve. So we left it deliberately big, but we are building off that e21 Initiative, which we participated in, but we didn't drive.

I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014 and update you on some exciting developments Xcel Energy. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items.
2014 was another strong year for Xcel Energy, as the company reported earnings of $2.03 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive year we've met or exceeded our earnings guidance and the fifth consecutive year we've delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In addition, we raised our dividend for the 11th year on a row.
From a regulatory perspective, we made significant progress wrapping up rate cases in Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas. We received a constructive ALJ recommendation in Minnesota and, most recently, reached a favorable 3-year settlement in our Colorado electric case. When we filed the case in Colorado, we stated that our objective was to establish a multiyear regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. This settlement accomplishes that goal and provides us a reasonable opportunity to earn our authorized return in our Colorado electric business over the next 3 years.
From an operational perspective, I also wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the efforts of our employees this year. We hit record levels of safety in 2014, improving for the seventh straight year. And again, we demonstrated our top-tier operating performance with industry-leading reliability scores.
Recall, last quarter, we unveiled our refreshed strategic plan that was focused on improving utility performance, including the goal of closing the ROE gap by 50 basis points and increasing the amount of revenue generated from long-term regulatory agreements; driving operational excellence by focusing on limiting annual increases in O&M cost to between 0% and 2%; providing our customers more options and solutions; and finally, investing for the future by focusing on incremental growth opportunities in our natural gas and transmission businesses.
Today, we're excited to update you on the progress we've made on some of these initiatives. The electric utility industry is in the midst of a major transition, and we're committed to being on the front end of this change. We will be a leader in the same way we proactively implemented our environmental strategy over a decade ago.
To this end, we are pursuing regulatory changes to better align with the clear direction that customer preferences, federal policies and state initiatives are moving. Last month, in Minnesota, a collaborative report was issued by a diverse stakeholder group known as the e21 Initiative. The group released a set of recommendations that are intended to act as a blueprint for a new customer-centric, performance-based regulatory approach.
Following the e21 report, we filed with the Minnesota Commission a framework on how we envision enabling these changes. We focused on 4 key objectives: lowering carbon emissions by 40% by 2030; pioneering distribution grid modernization; responding to changing customer preferences and providing new services and products; and finally, pursuing more predictable and nimble rate recovery.
In order to effectively bring about these changes, it is essential that the company have a longer-term, more holistic regulatory compact. Longer-term, multiyear agreements and additional riders are expected to improve visibility and supplement our efforts. Further, the company has tools they can utilize to stabilize rate increases and make bills more predictable for our customers. We expect to work with the commission and various stakeholders in Minnesota in 2015 to developed this new framework and have requested a planning meeting in the coming months to discuss potential options in greater detail.
We're also exploring ways for us to avoid the need to file a 2016 rate case, which will allow more time to concentrate on the longer-term regulatory framework.
In January, we filed our resource plan in Minnesota, which provides details on how we will achieve our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This will be accomplished by significantly increasing the amount of solar and wind on the NSP system, adding natural gas generation, continuing our industry-leading commitment to conservation programs, operating our nuclear plants at least through their current licenses and continuing to run Sherco Units 1 and 2 with gradual decreased reliance on those units through 2030.
This proactive, no-regrets strategy will better position the company and our customers for the long run and do so at an incremental cumulative cost of less than 3% through 2030. As a result, by 2030, 63% of our energy will be carbon-free at NSP. Clearly, 2015 is going to be a transformational year in Minnesota.
While much of our discussion is focused on Minnesota, we're also pursuing changes in our Texas jurisdiction. Along with other non-ERCOT utilities, we will be sponsoring legislation this session that will help reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to invest in a system to support growth in the region, which is continuing even in the face of a challenging oil price environment.
Finally, we wanted to update you on our natural gas growth initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to file a general rate case for our Colorado gas business. The filing will include a number of investments to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.
Concurrent with our rate case, we will begin working with our commission and major stakeholders to explore rate-basing natural gas reserves as a way to take advantage of the current low natural gas price and to provide a longer-term hedge for our customers. Following our stakeholder and outreach and education, we expect to make a separate filing to begin the regulatory process. We're excited by the progress we've made and the steps we've taken thus far, and I look forward to updating you later this year.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa."

Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share, compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.
The most significant driver related to 2014 earnings was improved electric and natural gas margins that benefited from new rates and increased rider revenues in many of our jurisdictions. Increased margins more than offset an unfavorable weather comparison and higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. It is worth noting that the weather in 2014 contributed $0.03 per share when compared to normal. In contrast, in 2013, weather contributed $0.11 per share, resulting in a $0.08 per share decline when comparing the 2 years.
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. We experienced positive growth trends in 2014 with weather-normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.3% and firm natural gas sales improving 4.6%. Sales in 2014 exceeded our original expectations for the year. While we are monitoring economic conditions in our service territories and are closely watching potential implications from changes in the E&P space, we remain confident in our 2015 electric weather-adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%.
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 3.3% in 2014 due to strengthened C&I sales from growth in the sand mining industry and related oil and gas businesses. Customer growth and modest usage increases drove higher residential sales. Electric sales at SPS increased 2.3% driven by growth in the C&I class.
Oil and gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory, and we saw additional growth in uranium enrichment. While we are watching the oil price closely and expect some producers to reduce new drilling activity, we anticipate that others will continue to grow production.
PSCo sales increased 1.2%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class due to new food manufacturing customers and energy sector growth. Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased 0.6% driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and usage increases in the small C&I class.
Economic conditions remained strong across Xcel Energy service territories relative to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our regions of 3.6% remains well below the national average of 5.4%. In addition, the number of jobs in our regions grew 2.3% during 2014, compared with 1.9% for the nation.
Focusing more specifically on 2014 earnings, ongoing electric margin increased $215 million. Key drivers included: implementation of final and interim rates, which increased margin by $129 million; nonfuel riders increased margin by $57 million; increased transmission investment, which improved margin by $31 million; and retail sales growth, excluding weather, improved margins by $24 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $60 million, as well as a few other items.
The electric margin results reflect an estimated refund obligation for the Minnesota rate case, which is relatively consistent with the recent ALJ recommendation; and an estimated customer refund liability to capture the impact of our electric earnings test at PSCo.
Margins on the natural gas side of the business increased by $49 million for the year. This is primarily due to rate release in Colorado, significant infrastructure investment that is captured in an annual rider and retail sales growth.
O&M expenses increased $61 million or 2.7% for 2014, solidly within our original guidance of a 2% to 3% increase. The increase is primarily driven by higher, although moderating, nuclear costs. As we have discussed in the past, a key objective of our operational excellence strategic pillar is to limit O&M increases. We are reaffirming our 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2%, consistent with our long-term objective.
In addition, I think it's worth mentioning that our 2015 O&M guidance assumption reflects a lower pension discount rate and adoption of the recently updated mortality tables. Finally, other taxes increased about $45 million or 11%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota, Texas and Colorado.
Next, I'll update you on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we're pleased to have reached a settlement with parties that would successfully resolve our electric rate case. The agreement continues the productive, multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. The settlement calls for a total increase of about $53 million or 1.9% based on an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we anticipate that PSCo will defer about $3 million in expenses in 2015. The agreement also stipulates that both the clean air, clean jobs and transmission riders are forward-looking mechanisms.
It is worth noting that, in our original Colorado rate case, we had proposed shortening the depreciable lives of certain assets, which would have led to a material increase in depreciation expense. As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not be implementing the depreciation changes and will avoid this incremental depreciation expense. Alternatively, we agreed to file a standalone depreciation study early next year that will be incorporated into our next rate case anticipated in 2018. The commission is expected to rule on the settlement in the first quarter, and rates are expected to be come effective in mid-February.
Last month, we received the ALJ recommendation in our Minnesota electric case. We were encouraged by the -- that the judge acknowledged the strength of the company's position on many of the key issues, including pension, benefits and depreciation. When including the ALJ's recommended ROE of 9.77% and adjusting for sales and property tax troughs, we estimate a cumulative revenue increase of about $192 million for 2014 and 2015. Deliberations are currently scheduled for March.
Turning to our Monticello Prudence review, we have not yet received the ALJ recommendation. We believe the delay is related to workload issues for the ALJ and anticipate the ALJ recommendation in February. We continue to believe that we acted prudently in making decisions throughout the course of the project. In addition, the surrounding communities and our customers have a largely rebuilt, safe and efficient source of carbon-free, low-cost power for many years to come. Importantly, we don't believe that the delay in receiving the ALJ's recommendation will impact the current schedule, and we continue to expect the commission to deliberate on the proceeding in March.
In Texas, we filed a rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of $65 million or 6.7%. Our filing reflects the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions, one of the items we are seeking legislative support for in Texas. New rates are expected to be implemented by mid-year. In South Dakota, we put interim rates of about $16 million in place on January 1 and continue to work through the regulatory process. Final rates are expected to be approved mid-year.
We also made progress on several other initiatives during the fourth quarter. In Wisconsin, the commission approved a settlement agreement, which we reached last year with staff and intervenors, for a rate increase of $14 million or 2.2%. Rates went into effect earlier this month.
In Texas, the commission approved our settlement in the 2014 rate case, providing incremental revenue of $37 million or 3.5%. Rates went into effect retroactive to June 2014.
Finally, in Minnesota, the commission approved our gas infrastructure rider for $15 million with rates becoming effective in February 2015. In summary, 2014 was a busy and productive year for us on the regulatory front.
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions, as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed, due primarily to incorporating actual 2014 results.
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. After a solid 2014, we are pleased to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, our 5-year capital plan of $14.5 billion and our 4.7% rate base CAGR, even when considering the impacts from the recently passed bonus depreciation legislation.
We continue to see improved economic conditions in our regions and experience better-than-expected sales growth, with 2014 weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.3% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.6%. We are making meaningful progress on the regulatory front, including the recent multiyear settlement in Colorado, and expect to reach a conclusion in the Minnesota case in the next few months.
We delivered 2014 O&M expense growth within our guidance of 2% to 3% and continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to 2%.
And finally, we are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually.
So with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

It doesn't mean we can't do something before that. But as you know, renewables are heavily driven by tax appetites, and you need one to efficiently -- it doesn't mean you're fully precluded, but to efficiently participate in those markets. Your question was about transcos and transmission. Well, keep in mind that $4.5 billion of our CapEx over the next 5 years is in transmission. None of it is in a transco or -- and none of it assumes that we win any of the competitive transmission projects. So when you look at what's come out of SPP and their ITP10 plan, I think it was about $300-odd million of potential opportunities. By the way, it looks like a -- not an insignificant amount of that would go into the -- to SPS. But we don't have -- that does not impact. That would be the icing on the cake. So our strategy has always been 2-prong. We have the utility vehicle to invest in, that's where we are today. We're in the process of getting approvals, final approvals on our transcos so that we can participate in those competitive markets. I think we're well positioned to do that. It's going a little bit slower, as you mentioned, than I think many people thought. That doesn't really surprise us. I think there'll be more opportunities in the years to come. And again, I think we'll be very well positioned to win in those markets."

I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014 and update you on some exciting developments Xcel Energy. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items.
2014 was another strong year for Xcel Energy, as the company reported earnings of $2.03 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive year we've met or exceeded our earnings guidance and the fifth consecutive year we've delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In addition, we raised our dividend for the 11th year on a row.
From a regulatory perspective, we made significant progress wrapping up rate cases in Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas. We received a constructive ALJ recommendation in Minnesota and, most recently, reached a favorable 3-year settlement in our Colorado electric case. When we filed the case in Colorado, we stated that our objective was to establish a multiyear regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. This settlement accomplishes that goal and provides us a reasonable opportunity to earn our authorized return in our Colorado electric business over the next 3 years.
From an operational perspective, I also wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the efforts of our employees this year. We hit record levels of safety in 2014, improving for the seventh straight year. And again, we demonstrated our top-tier operating performance with industry-leading reliability scores.
Recall, last quarter, we unveiled our refreshed strategic plan that was focused on improving utility performance, including the goal of closing the ROE gap by 50 basis points and increasing the amount of revenue generated from long-term regulatory agreements; driving operational excellence by focusing on limiting annual increases in O&M cost to between 0% and 2%; providing our customers more options and solutions; and finally, investing for the future by focusing on incremental growth opportunities in our natural gas and transmission businesses.
Today, we're excited to update you on the progress we've made on some of these initiatives. The electric utility industry is in the midst of a major transition, and we're committed to being on the front end of this change. We will be a leader in the same way we proactively implemented our environmental strategy over a decade ago.
To this end, we are pursuing regulatory changes to better align with the clear direction that customer preferences, federal policies and state initiatives are moving. Last month, in Minnesota, a collaborative report was issued by a diverse stakeholder group known as the e21 Initiative. The group released a set of recommendations that are intended to act as a blueprint for a new customer-centric, performance-based regulatory approach.
Following the e21 report, we filed with the Minnesota Commission a framework on how we envision enabling these changes. We focused on 4 key objectives: lowering carbon emissions by 40% by 2030; pioneering distribution grid modernization; responding to changing customer preferences and providing new services and products; and finally, pursuing more predictable and nimble rate recovery.
In order to effectively bring about these changes, it is essential that the company have a longer-term, more holistic regulatory compact. Longer-term, multiyear agreements and additional riders are expected to improve visibility and supplement our efforts. Further, the company has tools they can utilize to stabilize rate increases and make bills more predictable for our customers. We expect to work with the commission and various stakeholders in Minnesota in 2015 to develop this new framework and have requested a planning meeting in the coming months to discuss potential options in greater detail.
We're also exploring ways for us to avoid the need to file a 2016 rate case, which will allow more time to concentrate on the longer-term regulatory framework.
In January, we filed our resource plan in Minnesota, which provides details on how we will achieve our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This will be accomplished by significantly increasing the amount of solar and wind on the NSP system, adding natural gas generation, continuing our industry-leading commitment to conservation programs, operating our nuclear plants at least through their current licenses and continuing to run Sherco Units 1 and 2 with gradual decreased reliance on those units through 2030.
This proactive, no-regrets strategy will better position the company and our customers for the long run and do so at an incremental cumulative cost of less than 3% through 2030. As a result, by 2030, 63% of our energy will be carbon-free at NSP. Clearly, 2015 is going to be a transformational year in Minnesota.
While much of our discussion is focused on Minnesota, we're also pursuing changes in our Texas jurisdiction. Along with other non-ERCOT utilities, we will be sponsoring legislation this session that will help reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to invest in a system to support growth in the region, which is continuing even in the face of a challenging oil price environment.
Finally, we wanted to update you on our natural gas growth initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to file a general rate case for our Colorado gas business. The filing will include a number of investments to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.
Concurrent with our rate case, we will begin working with our commission and major stakeholders to explore rate-basing natural gas reserves as a way to take advantage of the current low natural gas price and to provide a longer-term hedge for our customers. Following our stakeholder and outreach and education, we expect to make a separate filing to begin the regulatory process. We're excited by the progress we've made and the steps we've taken thus far, and I look forward to updating you later this year.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa."
527542,281154040,752026,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share, compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.The most sign",1505,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I'll be focusing my discussion on full year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share, compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share.
The most significant driver related to 2014 earnings was improved electric and natural gas margins that benefited from new rates and increased rider revenues in many of our jurisdictions. Increased margins more than offset an unfavorable weather comparison and higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. It is worth noting that the weather in 2014 contributed $0.03 per share when compared to normal. In contrast, in 2013, weather contributed $0.11 per share, resulting in a $0.08 per share decline when comparing the 2 years.
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. We experienced positive growth trends in 2014 with weather-normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.3% and firm natural gas sales improving 4.6%. Sales in 2014 exceeded our original expectations for the year. While we are monitoring economic conditions in our service territories and are closely watching potential implications from changes in the E&P space, we remain confident in our 2015 electric weather-adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%.
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 3.3% in 2014 due to strengthened C&I sales from growth in the sand mining industry and related oil and gas businesses. Customer growth and modest usage increases drove higher residential sales. Electric sales at SPS increased 2.3% driven by growth in the C&I class.
Oil and gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory, and we saw additional growth in uranium enrichment. While we are watching the oil price closely and expect some producers to reduce new drilling activity, we anticipate that others will continue to grow production.
PSCo sales increased 1.2%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class due to new food manufacturing customers and energy sector growth. Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased 0.6% driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and usage increases in the small C&I class.
Economic conditions remained strong across Xcel Energy service territories relative to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our regions of 3.6% remains well below the national average of 5.4%. In addition, the number of jobs in our regions grew 2.3% during 2014, compared with 1.9% for the nation.
Focusing more specifically on 2014 earnings, ongoing electric margin increased $215 million. Key drivers included: implementation of final and interim rates, which increased margin by $129 million; nonfuel riders increased margin by $57 million; increased transmission investment, which improved margin by $31 million; and retail sales growth, excluding weather, improved margins by $24 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $60 million, as well as a few other items.
The electric margin results reflect an estimated refund obligation for the Minnesota rate case, which is relatively consistent with the recent ALJ recommendation; and an estimated customer refund liability to capture the impact of our electric earnings test at PSCo.
Margins on the natural gas side of the business increased by $49 million for the year. This is primarily due to rate release in Colorado, significant infrastructure investment that is captured in an annual rider and retail sales growth.
O&M expenses increased $61 million or 2.7% for 2014, solidly within our original guidance of a 2% to 3% increase. The increase is primarily driven by higher, although moderating, nuclear costs. As we have discussed in the past, a key objective of our operational excellence strategic pillar is to limit O&M increases. We are reaffirming our 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2%, consistent with our long-term objective.
In addition, I think it's worth mentioning that our 2015 O&M guidance assumption reflects a lower pension discount rate and adoption of the recently updated mortality tables. Finally, other taxes increased about $45 million or 11%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota, Texas and Colorado.
Next, I'll update you on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we're pleased to have reached a settlement with parties that would successfully resolve our electric rate case. The agreement continues the productive, multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. The settlement calls for a total increase of about $53 million or 1.9% based on an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we anticipate that PSCo will defer about $3 million in expenses in 2015. The agreement also stipulates that both the clean air, clean jobs and transmission riders are forward-looking mechanisms.
It is worth noting that, in our original Colorado rate case, we had proposed shortening the depreciable lives of certain assets, which would have led to a material increase in depreciation expense. As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not be implementing the depreciation changes and will avoid this incremental depreciation expense. Alternatively, we agreed to file a standalone depreciation study early next year that will be incorporated into our next rate case anticipated in 2018. The commission is expected to rule on the settlement in the first quarter, and rates are expected to become effective in mid-February.
Last month, we received the ALJ recommendation in our Minnesota electric case. We were encouraged by the -- that the judge acknowledged the strength of the company's position on many of the key issues, including pension, benefits and depreciation. When including the ALJ's recommended ROE of 9.77% and adjusting for sales and property tax troughs, we estimate a cumulative revenue increase of about $192 million for 2014 and 2015. Deliberations are currently scheduled for March.
Turning to our Monticello Prudence review, we have not yet received the ALJ recommendation. We believe the delay is related to workload issues for the ALJ and anticipate the ALJ recommendation in February. We continue to believe that we acted prudently in making decisions throughout the course of the project. In addition, the surrounding communities and our customers have a largely rebuilt, safe and efficient source of carbon-free, low-cost power for many years to come. Importantly, we don't believe that the delay in receiving the ALJ's recommendation will impact the current schedule, and we continue to expect the commission to deliberate on the proceeding in March.
In Texas, we filed a rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of $65 million or 6.7%. Our filing reflects the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions, one of the items we are seeking legislative support for in Texas. New rates are expected to be implemented by mid-year. In South Dakota, we put interim rates of about $16 million in place on January 1 and continue to work through the regulatory process. Final rates are expected to be approved mid-year.
We also made progress on several other initiatives during the fourth quarter. In Wisconsin, the commission approved a settlement agreement, which we reached last year with staff and intervenors, for a rate increase of $14 million or 2.2%. Rates went into effect earlier this month.
In Texas, the commission approved our settlement in the 2014 rate case, providing incremental revenue of $37 million or 3.5%. Rates went into effect retroactive to June 2014.
Finally, in Minnesota, the commission approved our gas infrastructure rider for $15 million with rates becoming effective in February 2015. In summary, 2014 was a busy and productive year for us on the regulatory front.
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions, as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed, due primarily to incorporating actual 2014 results.
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. After a solid 2014, we are pleased to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, our 5-year capital plan of $14.5 billion and our 4.7% rate base CAGR, even when considering the impacts from the recently passed bonus depreciation legislation.
We continue to see improved economic conditions in our regions and experience better-than-expected sales growth, with 2014 weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.3% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.6%. We are making meaningful progress on the regulatory front, including the recent multiyear settlement in Colorado, and expect to reach a conclusion in the Minnesota case in the next few months.
We delivered 2014 O&M expense growth within our guidance of 2% to 3% and continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to 2%.
And finally, we are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually.
So with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

But as you know, renewables are heavily driven by tax appetites, and you need one to efficiently -- it doesn't mean you're fully precluded, but to efficiently participate in those markets. Your question was about transcos and transmission. Well, keep in mind that $4.5 billion of our CapEx over the next 5 years is in transmission. None of it is in a transco or -- and none of it assumes that we win any of the competitive transmission projects. So when you look at what's come out of SPP and their ITP10 plan, I think it was about $300-odd million of potential opportunities. By the way, it looks like a -- not an insignificant amount of that would go into the -- to SPS. But we don't have -- that does not impact. That would be the icing on the cake. So our strategy has always been two-prong. We have the utility vehicle to invest in, that's where we are today. We're in the process of getting approvals, final approvals on our transcos so that we can participate in those competitive markets. I think we're well positioned to do that. It's going a little bit slower, as you mentioned, than I think many people thought. That doesn't really surprise us. I think there'll be more opportunities in the years to come.

Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 
First quarter 2015 ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which excluded charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota commission in the Monticello review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.03 per share. Management believes ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of charges related to the review provide a more meaningful comparison.

Today, I'm going to provide a business update, review several recent regulatory outcomes, speak to you about our legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas and discuss our recently increased dividend growth objective. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. 
We're beginning 2015 with a solid start. While timing and weather differences led to some variability in the quarter, our earnings remain on track and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. In February, we increased our dividend almost 7%. We also raised our annual dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and established a formal payout of 60% to 70%. These actions reflect our confidence in the company's long-term strategic plan, the strength of our balance sheet and our projected cash flows. 
From an operational perspective, we met key milestones in our transformation business, as we energized the final sections on 2 of our major CapEx 2020 projects, bringing the lines into service on time and on budget. The region will derive meaningful benefits from these valuable assets. 
We're also pleased to be named the #1 win provider in the country for the 11th straight year by AWEA. We're pleased to be included in Forbes Magazine of the 100 most trustworthy companies in America and to be recognized as the best for Vets Employer. 
From a regulatory perspective, we brought 3 major proceedings to a close. In Colorado, the commission approved our 3-year electrical regulatory plan. This constructive multiyear settlement provides rate certainty for our customers and revenue certainty for our company. This represents the second multiyear plan we have implemented in our Colorado electric business, and we believe that this agreement can service a blueprint for our pending natural gas rate case. 
Turning to Minnesota. We continue to believe we acted prudently throughout the construction process at our Monticello nuclear facility. The important takeaway is that our customers and the region will benefit from a safe, reliable and diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, for many years to come. While we disagree with some of the commission's findings, and we will need to review the final order, it does represent resolution of initiative that has been an overhang on the company. 
Finally, in our inaugural, multiyear rate case in Minnesota, we were encouraged that the commission generally agree with the ALJ recommendations in the preceding and the support of the company's position on many other key issues. And while we would have preferred to avoid a 2016 regulatory filing, and we felt we provided a path to do so, we believe the final result was a reasonable outcome. However, we continue to believe there's an opportunity for future improvement in streamlining of the regulatory process. We feel that more specific legislation will facilitate this and provide greater predictability for customers and the company. 
In order to achieve the ambitious state and federal policy initiatives that are quickly approaching, it's important that the company have additional tools at its disposal to meet these evolving requirements. As a result, we've been proactively working with key stakeholders on our multiyear plan regulatory bill currently being considered by the Minnesota Legislature. Some of the key components of this regulatory compact include: expanding to a 5-year multiyear plan; allowing for a formulate recovery of capital investments; recovery of O&M expenses based on our electric industry price index; continuation of interim rates while the plan is on our consideration; and protections in the event of unforeseen developments. 
The proposed multiyear plan legislation is contained in the omnibus house energy bill. The state omnibus energy bill does not include the multiyear plan legislation. The energy bills have passed the floor boat in both the House and the Senate. The bills will now be reconciled in conference committee, and we expect the final bill will include the multiyear plan legislation. Once the committee has reconciled the bill, it will be sent back to the Senate and House for a vote and while the process remains fluid, we are cautiously optimistic regarding its passage. If successful, we will look to incorporate components of the bill as appropriate in our rate filings in the future. 
In Texas, we've worked with various stakeholders on a bill that addresses regulatory lag. The regulatory bill passed out of the house committee earlier this month, and we are waiting for it to be scheduled for a vote on the floor. The proposed legislation provides for the inclusion of posttest year rate base additions and supports the implementation of more timely surcharges. However, industrial customers continue to have concerns with the bill and we are currently working to resolve these issues. We are hopeful that the bill will be passed into law as it is an important step towards reducing regulatory lag and would help to facilitate investment in the growing area. 
Late last year, we discussed our plans to focus on incremental growth opportunities in transmission and natural gas assets. Recently, we've been socializing the concept our rate basing natural gas reserves in Colorado. We are working with stakeholders to see if we can schedule a series of discussions to explore the concept of rate basing natural gas reserves and how to best take advantage of the current low natural gas price for the benefit of customers and the company alike. 
Finally, I wanted to brief you on about an exciting new investment that we're pursuing. Courtney has a 200-megawatt wind power purchase agreement that NSP-Minnesota signed in 2013. For various reasons, the developer has decided to exit the project, providing us an opportunity to pursue ownership of the wind farm and to ensure that our customers will benefit from the addition of cost-effective wind generation. We are seeking regulatory approval in Minnesota and North Dakota to take this project over and eventually place it in rate base. The facility's expected to be in service at the end of 2016 and cost approximately $300 million. The project is not included in our current 5-year capital forecast, and we don't anticipate needing to issue any incremental equity to finance it. 
We've made significant progress in the first 4 months of this year and I look forward to making even more progress in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa."
527542,289844422,799714,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share versus $0.52 per share last year. While the court to some timing differences and adverse weather comparison, the results were in line with our expe",1338,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share versus $0.52 per share last year. While the court to some timing differences and adverse weather comparison, the results were in line with our expectations. The most significant driver in the quarter was improved electric margin that resulted from new rates. However, the weather comparison versus 2014 was significant, causing a $0.05 per share negative variance. Increased O&M and depreciation, along with a higher effective tax rate, were also notable offsets. 
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. Weather normalized electric sales increased 0.5% for the quarter in natural gas sales rose 2.9%. In the first quarter of 2014, we experienced very cold weather. As we all know, the weather normalization process is not in an exact science. And it is possible that our first quarter 2014 weather normalized sales may have been somewhat distorted. With that in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2015 electric weather adjusted sales growth assumptions of 1%. 
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather adjusted retail sales increased 1.7%, due primarily to growth in the oil, gas and sand mining related businesses. Electric sales at SPS increased 1.9%, driven by growth in both the residential and C&I classes. While we are closely monitoring the impact of oil prices on production activity, the Permian Basin has been resilient. PSCo's electric sales increased 0.04%, which is primarily attributable to the strength in the C&I class due to expansions in the health care and technology services sectors. 
Finally, NSP-Minnesota's electric sales decreased 0.5% as usage declines more than offset new customer additions in both the residential and C&I classes. 
Overall, our service territories remain healthy, particularly relative to the rest of the nation. Consolidated unemployment in our regions is 4.2%, well below the national average of 5.6%. The number of jobs in our regions grew 2.5% during the quarter compared with 2.3% for the nation. 
Focusing on earnings for the quarter. Ongoing electric margin increased to $40 million. Key drivers included: nonfuel riders that increased margin by $34 million, largely reflecting the clean air, clean jobs rider in Colorado, which became effective January 1, 2015; the implementation of final and interim rates increased margin by $23 million; and increased net transmission revenue, which improved margin by $7 million. Offsetting these positive factors was an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $25 million, as well as a few other less significant items. 
It is worth noting that during the first quarter of 2015, we took a conservative approach to revenue recognition. During the quarter, we continue to book revenues at the 2014 interim rate level and did not assume that the Minnesota commission would approve our netting proposal, which would have increased revenues by just over $10 million. If the NPC approves our interim rate netting proposal, we will record revenue in that period at the higher authorized level retroactive to January 1, 2015. 
When thinking about margin comparisons for the remainder of the year, it is important to remember that as we move through the balance of 2014, we recorded increasingly larger potential refunds to customers, ending the year with a rate increase consistent with the ALJ recommendation. Due to these timing factors, we expect an improving margin comparison in Minnesota for the remainder of the year. 
Margins on the natural gas side of our business decreased by $12 million for the quarter. This was primarily due to the negative weather comparison, which more than offset higher rider revenues and retail sales growth. 
O&M expenses increased $26 million in the quarter. The higher level is almost entirely driven by the timing of plant outages. We remain confident that we will achieve our annual O&M growth assumption of 0% to 2%. 
Depreciation expense increased $27 million for the quarter due to capital investment and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota. 
Finally, other taxes increased about $12 million, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. During the quarter, as Ben indicated, we made significant progress with our regulatory agenda, resolving 3 key proceedings. 
Beginning with Minnesota and our multiyear rate filing, we were pleased that the commission recognized the strength of the company's arguments and largely accepted the recommendations of the ALJ. Based on our interpretation of that commission's oral deliberation, we estimate a total revenue increase of $168 million, which compares to our revised request of $221 million. The commission approved a 9.72% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and a 3-year decoupling pilot. We view this as a reasonable outcome and expect the final written order in May. 
We also concluded final deliberations in our Monticello improvements review. The commission approved a full return of $415 million of the project's $748 million total cost. However, allowed recovery of the investment with no return, on the remaining $333 million. As a result, we recorded a one-time pretax charge of $129 million during the quarter. We estimate that the 2015 ongoing pretax impact of the decision will be approximately $16 million on a total company basis. 
Finally, in February, we were pleased that the Colorado commission approved its settlement in our electric rate case. The final decision reflected an overall revenue increase of $53 million in 2015 and ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we have implemented forward-looking riders for our clean air, clean jobs and transmission related spending. The agreement covers 2015 through 2017 and continues the productive multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. 
In March, the PSCo filed a multiyear natural gas rate case covering 2015 through 2017. We are requesting a 2015 rate increase of about $41 million and subsequent step increases of $8 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2017. The requested ROE is 10.1%  in 2015 and '16, rising to 10.3% in 2017. In addition, we filed for a 5-year extension of our pipeline System Integrity rider that drives revenue increases of $22 million and $21 million in 2016 and '17. 
We filed a gas case with principles generally consistent with the recently settled electric case, which we hope will provide the framework for our first multiyear natural gas rate plan in Colorado. 
In our Texas rate case, the schedule has been have been abated for 30 days in order to allow for settlement discussions. However, we haven't been successful in reaching a settlement, therefore, the procedure's schedule to process the case was established on Monday. Regardless, the parties have agreed rates will be effective in mid-June. 
Finally, in South Dakota, interim rates of about $16 million went into effect on January 1. We currently are in settlement in negotiations with parties and expect final rates to be effective midyear. 
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed. For more information, please see our earnings release. 
With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are pleased to be making progress with our regulatory agenda. We have gained substantial clarity in recent months and are cautiously optimistic regarding the potential success of our legislative initiatives. We are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are excited about the Courtney windfarm investment opportunity. We continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to up to 2%. We are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually. 
And finally, we are pleased to raise our dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. 
So operator, we'll now take questions."

I mean, first of all, as we all know, making in the political process can be kind of messy. And that's what we're in. And -- but what we're being told and what we understand is while there's controversy between the House and Senate bill, and that's the difference between Republican versus DFL controlled and they're different interest, the multiyear plan provisions really aren't controversial. So when this thing goes to conference committee, we think it's a very good possibility that the provisions of the multiyear plan remain. While you can only be cautiously optimistic because it is a political process and if there were things in the final bill that was passed by both House and Senate that were unappealing to the Governor, you always have a risk of veto. So that's the reality there. In terms of whether if it will be viewed by the commission as an option versus a mandate, I think one, you'd have to look and see how the legislation is finalized. But I also believe that the commission is frustrated with how the process works in Minnesota too. So I think you kind of saw that as the commission was thinking about the opportunity that we said to stay out of 2016. And I'm not sure that they felt they were -- it was quite ready. And so with legislation, even if it's an option versus a mandate, I think they feel much more comfortable with that. Chris, we have Chris here. I don't know if, Chris, you want to add to that."

Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 
First quarter 2015 ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which excluded charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota Commission in the Monticello Prudence Review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.30 per share. Management believes ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of charges related to the prudence review provide a more meaningful comparison.

Today, I'm going to provide a business update, review several recent regulatory outcomes, speak to you about our legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas and discuss our recently increased dividend growth objective. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. 
We're beginning 2005 (sic)  with a solid start. While timing and weather differences led to some variability in the quarter, our earnings remain on track, and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. In February, we increased our dividend almost 7%. We also raised our annual dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and established a formal payout target of 60% to 70%. These actions reflect our confidence in the company's long-term strategic plan, the strength of our balance sheet and our projected cash flows. 
From an operational perspective, we met key milestones in our transmission business, as we energized the final sections on 2 of our major CapEx 2020 projects, bringing the lines into service on time and on budget. The region will derive meaningful benefits from these valuable assets. 
We're also pleased to be named the #1 wind provider in the country for the 11th straight year by AWEA. We're pleased to be included in Forbes Magazine of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America and to be recognized as the Best for Vets Employer. 
From a regulatory perspective, we brought 3 major proceedings to a close. In Colorado, the commission approved our 3-year electric regulatory plan. This constructive multiyear settlement provides rate certainty for our customers and revenue certainty for the company. This represents the second multiyear plan we have implemented in our Colorado electric business, and we believe that this agreement can service a blueprint for our pending natural gas rate case. 
Turning to Minnesota. We continue to believe we acted prudently throughout the construction process at our Monticello nuclear facility. The important takeaway is that our customers and the region will benefit from a safe, reliable and diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, for many years to come. While we disagree with some of the commission's findings, and we will need to review the final order, it does represent resolution of an issue that has been an overhang on the company. 
Finally, in our inaugural, multiyear rate case in Minnesota, we were encouraged that the commission generally agree with the ALJ recommendations in the proceeding and supported the company's position on many other key issues. And while we would have preferred to avoid a 2016 regulatory filing, and we felt we provided a path to do so, we believe the final result was a reasonable outcome. However, we continue to believe there's an opportunity for future improvement in streamlining the regulatory process. We feel that more specific legislation will facilitate this and provide greater predictability for customers and the company. 
In order to achieve the ambitious state and federal policy initiatives that are quickly approaching, it's important that the company have additional tools at its disposal to meet these evolving requirements. As a result, we've been proactively working with key stakeholders on our multiyear plan regulatory bill currently being considered by the Minnesota Legislature. Some of the key components of this regulatory compact include: expanding to a 5-year multiyear plan, allowing for formulaic recovery of capital investments, recovery of O&M expenses based on our electric industry price index, continuation of interim rates while the plan is under consideration and protections in the event of unforeseen developments. 
The proposed multiyear plan legislation is contained in the Omnibus House Energy Bill. The state Omnibus Energy Bill does not include the multiyear plan legislation. The energy bills have passed the floor vote in both the House and the Senate. The bills will now be reconciled in conference committee, and we expect the final bill will include the multiyear plan legislation. Once the committee has reconciled the bill, it will be sent back to the Senate and House for a vote, and while the process remains fluid, we are cautiously optimistic regarding its passage. If successful, we will look to incorporate components of the bill as appropriate in our rate filings in the future. 
In Texas, we've worked with various stakeholders on a bill that addresses regulatory lag. The regulatory bill passed out of the house committee earlier this month, and we are waiting for it to be scheduled for a vote on the floor. The proposed legislation provides for the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions and supports the implementation of more timely surcharges. However, industrial customers continue to have concerns with the bill, and we are currently working to resolve these issues. We are hopeful that the bill will be passed into law, as it is an important step towards reducing regulatory lag and would help to facilitate investment in the growing areas. 
Late last year, we discussed our plans to focus on incremental growth opportunities in transmission and natural gas assets. Recently, we've been socializing the concept of rate-basing natural gas reserves in Colorado. We are working with stakeholders to see if we can schedule a series of discussions to explore the concept of rate-basing natural gas reserves and how to best take advantage of the current low natural gas price for the benefit of customers and the company alike. 
Finally, I wanted to brief you on about an exciting new investment that we're pursuing. Courtenay has a 200-megawatt wind power purchase agreement that NSP-Minnesota signed in 2013. For various reasons, the developer has decided to exit the project, providing us an opportunity to pursue ownership of the wind farm and to ensure that our customers will benefit from the addition of cost-effective wind generation. We are seeking regulatory approval in Minnesota and North Dakota to take this project over and eventually placing in rate base. The facility is expected to be in service at the end of 2016 and costs approximately $300 million. The project is not included in our current 5-year capital forecast, and we don't anticipate needing to issue any incremental equity to finance it. We've made significant progress in the first 4 months of this year, and I look forward to making even more progress in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa."
527542,289844422,799945,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share versus $0.52 per share last year. While the quarter was subject to some timing differences and an adverse weather comparison, the results were in l",1331,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share versus $0.52 per share last year. While the quarter was subject to some timing differences and an adverse weather comparison, the results were in line with our expectations. The most significant driver in the quarter was improved electric margin that resulted from new rates. However, the weather comparison versus 2014 was significant, causing a $0.05 per share negative variance. Increased O&M and depreciation, along with a higher effective tax rate, were also notable offsets. 
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. Weather-normalized electric sales increased 0.5% for the quarter, and natural gas sales rose 2.9%. In the first quarter of 2014, we experienced very cold weather. As we all know, the weather normalization process is not an exact science, and it is possible that our first quarter 2014 weather-normalized sales may have been somewhat distorted. With that in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2015 electric weather adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%. 
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 1.7% due primarily to growth in the oil, gas and sand mining-related businesses. Electric sales at SPS increased 1.9%, driven by growth in both the residential and C&I classes. While we are closely monitoring the impact of oil prices on production activity, the Permian Basin has been resilient. PSCo's electric sales increased 0.4%, which was primarily attributable to strengths in the C&I class due to expansions in the health care and technology services sectors. Finally, NSP-Minnesota's electric sales decreased 0.5% as usage declines more than offset new customer additions in both the residential and C&I classes. 
Overall, our service territories remain healthy, particularly relative to the rest of the nation. Consolidated unemployment in our regions is 4.2%, well below the national average of 5.6%. The number of jobs in our regions grew 2.5% during the quarter compared with 2.3% for the nation. 
Focusing on earnings for the quarter. Ongoing electric margin increased to $40 million. Key drivers included: nonfuel riders that increased margin by $34 million, largely reflecting the Clean Air-Clean Jobs rider in Colorado, which became effective January 1, 2015; the implementation of final and interim rates increased margin by $23 million; and increased net transmission revenue, which improved margin by $7 million. Offsetting these positive factors was an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $25 million as well as a few other less significant items. 
It is worth noting that during the first quarter of 2015, we took a conservative approach to revenue recognition. During the quarter, we continue to book revenues at the 2014 interim-rate level and did not assume that the Minnesota Commission would approve our netting proposal, which would have increased revenues by just over $10 million. If the MPUC approves our interim-rate netting proposal, we will record revenue in that period at the higher authorized level retroactive to January 1, 2015. 
When thinking about margin comparisons for the remainder of the year, it is important to remember that as we move through the balance of 2014, we recorded increasingly larger potential refunds to customers, ending the year with a rate increase consistent with the ALJ recommendation. Due to these timing factors, we expect an improving margin comparison in Minnesota for the remainder of the year. 
Margins on the natural gas side of our business decreased by $12 million for the quarter. This was primarily due to the negative weather comparison, which more than offset higher rider revenue and retail sales growth. 
O&M expenses increased $26 million in the quarter. The higher level is almost entirely driven by the timing of planned outages. We remain confident that we will achieve our annual O&M growth assumption of 0% to 2%. 
Depreciation expense increased $27 million for the quarter due to capital investment and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota. Finally, other taxes increased about $12 million, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. During the quarter, as Ben indicated, we made significant progress with our regulatory agenda, resolving 3 key proceedings, beginning with Minnesota and our multiyear rate filing. We were pleased that the commission recognized the strength of the company's arguments and largely accepted the recommendations of the ALJ. Based on our interpretation of the commission's oral deliberations, we estimate a total revenue increase of $168 million, which compares to our revised request of $221 million. The commission approved a 9.72% ROE, an equity ratio of 52.5% and a 3-year decoupling pilot. We view this as a reasonable outcome and expect the final written order in May. 
We also concluded final deliberations in our Monticello Prudence Review. The commission approved a full return on $415 million of the project's $748 million total cost, however, allowed recovery of the investment with no return on the remaining $333 million. As a result, we recorded a onetime pretax charge of $129 million during the quarter. We estimate that the 2015 ongoing pretax impact of the decision will be approximately $16 million on a total company basis. 
Finally, in February, we were pleased that the Colorado commission approved the settlement in our electric rate case. The final decision reflected an overall revenue increase of $53 million in 2015, an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we have implemented forward-looking riders for our Clean Air-Clean Jobs and transmission-related spending. The agreement covers 2015 through 2017 and continues the productive multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. 
In March, the PSCo filed a multiyear natural gas rate case covering 2015 through 2017. We are requesting a 2015 rate increase of about $41 million and subsequent step increases of $8 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2017. The requested ROE is 10.1%  in 2015 and '16, rising to 10.3% in 2017. In addition, we filed for a 5-year extension of our Pipeline System Integrity rider that drives revenue increases of $22 million and $21 million in 2016 and '17. We filed a gas case with principles generally consistent with the recently settled electric case, which we hope will provide the framework for our first multiyear natural gas rate plan in Colorado. 
In our Texas rate case, the schedule has been -- had been abated for 30 days in order to allow for settlement discussions. However, we haven't been successful in reaching a settlement. Therefore, the procedure's schedule to process the case was established on Monday. Regardless, the parties have agreed rates will be effective in mid-June. 
Finally, in South Dakota, interim rates of about $16 million went into effect on January 1. We currently are in settlement negotiations with parties and expect final rates to be effective midyear. 
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed. For more information, please see our earnings release. 
With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are pleased to be making progress with our regulatory agenda. We have gained substantial clarity in recent months and are cautiously optimistic regarding the potential success of our legislative initiatives. We are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are excited about the Courtenay Wind Farm investment opportunity. We continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to up to 2%. We are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually. And finally, we are pleased to raise our dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. 
So operator, we'll now take questions."

And again, what we've talked about before is that we really need to have longer time frames where we're not in front of the regulator in a litigious kind of proceeding trying to get rate relief because there's a lot of policy discussions that we want to have and, frankly, I think our commission wants to have with us.

And so why do you feel convinced or hopeful that both House and the Senate can agree on the version of a bill that will actually include those multiyear rate cases? And more importantly, so we have this issue in Colorado earlier that regulators then didn't necessarily think that this -- that the new law is really binding. It's more of a suggestion. So how likely is it that we do get a bill and then the regulators in Minnesota think that it's still an option for them to pursue or not, and then we may end up in yet another rate case?"

I mean, first of all, as we all know, sausage-making and the political process can be kind of messy. And that's what we're in. And I -- and -- but what we're being told and what we understand is while there's controversy between the House and Senate bill, and that's the difference between Republican versus DFL controlled and their different interests, the multiyear plan provisions really aren't controversial. So when this thing goes to conference committee, we think it's a very good possibility that the provisions of the multiyear plan remain. While you can only be cautiously optimistic because it is a political process and if there were things in the final bill that was passed by both House and Senate that were unappealing to the governor, you always have a risk of veto. So that's the reality there. In terms of whether if it will be viewed by the commission as an option versus a mandate, I think, one, you'd have to look and see how the legislation is finalized. But I also believe that the commission is frustrated with how the process works in Minnesota, too. So I think you kind of saw that as the commission was thinking about the opportunity that we said to stay out of 2016. And I'm not sure that they felt they were -- it was quite ready. And so with legislation, even if it's an option versus a mandate, I think they'd feel much more comfortable with that. Chris -- we have Chris Clark here.

Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 
First quarter 2015 ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which excluded charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota Commission in the Monticello Prudence Review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.30 per share.

Today, I'm going to provide a business update, review several recent regulatory outcomes, speak to you about our legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas and discuss our recently increased dividend growth objective. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. 
We're beginning 2005 (sic) [ 2015 ]  with a solid start. While timing and weather differences led to some variability in the quarter, our earnings remain on track, and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. In February, we increased our dividend almost 7%. We also raised our annual dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and established a formal payout target of 60% to 70%. These actions reflect our confidence in the company's long-term strategic plan, the strength of our balance sheet and our projected cash flows. 
From an operational perspective, we met key milestones in our transmission business, as we energized the final sections on 2 of our major CapEx 2020 projects, bringing the lines into service on time and on budget. The region will derive meaningful benefits from these valuable assets. 
We're also pleased to be named the #1 wind provider in the country for the 11th straight year by AWEA. We're pleased to be included in Forbes Magazine of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America and to be recognized as the Best for Vets Employer. 
From a regulatory perspective, we brought 3 major proceedings to a close. In Colorado, the commission approved our 3-year electric regulatory plan. This constructive multiyear settlement provides rate certainty for our customers and revenue certainty for the company. This represents the second multiyear plan we have implemented in our Colorado electric business, and we believe that this agreement can serve as a blueprint for our pending natural gas rate case. 
Turning to Minnesota. We continue to believe we acted prudently throughout the construction process at our Monticello nuclear facility. The important takeaway is that our customers and the region will benefit from a safe, reliable and diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, for many years to come. While we disagree with some of the commission's findings and we will need to review the final order, it does represent resolution of an issue that has been an overhang on the company. 
Finally, in our inaugural, multiyear rate case in Minnesota, we were encouraged that the commission generally agree with the ALJ recommendations in the proceeding and supported the company's position on many of the key issues. And while we would have preferred to avoid a 2016 regulatory filing and we felt we provided a path to do so, we believe the final result was a reasonable outcome. However, we continue to believe there's an opportunity for future improvement in streamlining other regulatory process. We feel that more specific legislation will facilitate this and provide greater predictability for customers and the company. 
In order to achieve the ambitious State and Federal policy initiatives that are quickly approaching, it's important that the company have additional tools at its disposal to meet these evolving requirements. As a result, we've been proactively working with key stakeholders on a multiyear plan regulatory bill currently being considered by the Minnesota Legislature. Some of the key components of this regulatory compact include: expanding to a 5-year multiyear plan, allowing for formulaic recovery of capital investments, recovery of O&M expenses based on our electric industry price index, continuation of interim rates while the plan is under consideration and protections in the event of unforeseen developments. 
The proposed multiyear plan legislation is contained in the Omnibus House Energy Bill. The state Omnibus Energy Bill does not include the multiyear plan legislation. The energy bills have passed the floor vote in both the House and the Senate. The bills will now be reconciled in conference committee, and we expect the final bill will include the multiyear plan legislation. Once the committee has reconciled the bill, it will be sent back to the Senate and House for a vote, and while the process remains fluid, we are cautiously optimistic regarding its passage. If successful, we will look to incorporate components of the bill as appropriate in our rate filings in the future. 
In Texas, we've worked with various stakeholders on a bill that addresses regulatory lag. The regulatory bill passed out of the house committee earlier this month, and we are waiting for it to be scheduled for a vote on the floor. The proposed legislation provides for the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions and supports the implementation of more timely surcharges. However, industrial customers continue to have concerns with the bill, and we are currently working to resolve these issues. We are hopeful that the bill will be passed into law, as it is an important step towards reducing regulatory lag and would help to facilitate investment in the growing areas. 
Late last year, we discussed our plans to focus on incremental growth opportunities in transmission and natural gas assets. Recently, we've been socializing the concept of rate-basing natural gas reserves in Colorado. We are working with stakeholders to see if we can schedule a series of discussions to explore the concept of rate-basing natural gas reserves and how to best take advantage of the current low natural gas price for the benefit of customers and the company alike. 
Finally, I wanted to brief you on about an exciting new investment that we're pursuing. Courtenay has a 200-megawatt wind power purchase agreement that NSP-Minnesota signed in 2013. For various reasons, the developer has decided to exit the project, providing us an opportunity to pursue ownership of the wind farm and to ensure that our customers will benefit from the addition of cost-effective wind generation. We are seeking regulatory approval in Minnesota and North Dakota to take this project over and eventually place it in rate base. The facility is expected to be in service at the end of 2016 and costs approximately $300 million. The project is not included in our current 5-year capital forecast, and we don't anticipate needing to issue any incremental equity to finance it. 
We've made significant progress in the first 4 months of this year, and I look forward to making even more progress in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa."
527542,289844422,800406,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share versus $0.52 per share last year. While the quarter was subject to some timing differences and an adverse weather comparison, the results were in l",1331,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share versus $0.52 per share last year. While the quarter was subject to some timing differences and an adverse weather comparison, the results were in line with our expectations. The most significant driver in the quarter was improved electric margin that resulted from new rates. However, the weather comparison versus 2014 was significant, causing a $0.05 per share negative variance. Increased O&M and depreciation, along with a higher effective tax rate, were also notable offsets. 
Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. Weather-normalized electric sales increased 0.5% for the quarter, and natural gas sales rose 2.9%. In the first quarter of 2014, we experienced very cold weather. As we all know, the weather normalization process is not an exact science, and it is possible that our first quarter 2014 weather-normalized sales may have been somewhat distorted. With that in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2015 electric weather adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%. 
Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 1.7% due primarily to growth in the oil, gas and sand mining-related businesses. Electric sales at SPS increased 1.9%, driven by growth in both the residential and C&I classes. While we are closely monitoring the impact of oil prices on production activity, the Permian Basin has been resilient. PSCo's electric sales increased 0.4%, which was primarily attributable to strengths in the C&I class due to expansions in the health care and technology services sectors. Finally, NSP-Minnesota's electric sales decreased 0.5% as usage declines more than offset new customer additions in both the residential and C&I classes. 
Overall, our service territories remain healthy, particularly relative to the rest of the nation. Consolidated unemployment in our regions is 4.2%, well below the national average of 5.6%. The number of jobs in our regions grew 2.5% during the quarter compared with 2.3% for the nation. 
Focusing on earnings for the quarter. Ongoing electric margin increased to $40 million. Key drivers included: nonfuel riders that increased margin by $34 million, largely reflecting the Clean Air-Clean Jobs rider in Colorado, which became effective January 1, 2015; the implementation of final and interim rates increased margin by $23 million; and increased net transmission revenue, which improved margin by $7 million. Offsetting these positive factors was an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $25 million as well as a few other less significant items. 
It is worth noting that during the first quarter of 2015, we took a conservative approach to revenue recognition. During the quarter, we continue to book revenues at the 2014 interim-rate level and did not assume that the Minnesota Commission would approve our netting proposal, which would have increased revenues by just over $10 million. If the MPUC approves our interim-rate netting proposal, we will record revenue in that period at the higher authorized level retroactive to January 1, 2015. 
When thinking about margin comparisons for the remainder of the year, it is important to remember that as we move through the balance of 2014, we recorded increasingly larger potential refunds to customers, ending the year with a rate increase consistent with the ALJ recommendation. Due to these timing factors, we expect an improving margin comparison in Minnesota for the remainder of the year. 
Margins on the natural gas side of our business decreased by $12 million for the quarter. This was primarily due to the negative weather comparison, which more than offset higher rider revenue and retail sales growth. 
O&M expenses increased $26 million in the quarter. The higher level is almost entirely driven by the timing of plant outages. We remain confident that we will achieve our annual O&M growth assumption of 0% to 2%. 
Depreciation expense increased $27 million for the quarter due to capital investment and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota. Finally, other taxes increased about $12 million, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. During the quarter, as Ben indicated, we made significant progress with our regulatory agenda, resolving 3 key proceedings. Beginning with Minnesota and our multiyear rate filing, we were pleased that the commission recognized the strength of the company's arguments and largely accepted the recommendations of the ALJ. Based on our interpretation of the commission's oral deliberations, we estimate a total revenue increase of $168 million, which compares to our revised request of $221 million. The commission approved a 9.72% ROE, an equity ratio of 52.5% and a 3-year decoupling pilot. We view this as a reasonable outcome and expect the final written order in May. 
We also concluded final deliberations in our Monticello Prudence Review. The commission approved a full return on $415 million of the project's $748 million total cost, however, allowed recovery of the investment with no return on the remaining $333 million. As a result, we recorded a onetime pretax charge of $129 million during the quarter. We estimate that the 2015 ongoing pretax impact of the decision will be approximately $16 million on a total company basis. 
Finally, in February, we were pleased that the Colorado commission approved the settlement in our electric rate case. The final decision reflected an overall revenue increase of $53 million in 2015, an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we have implemented forward-looking riders for our Clean Air-Clean Jobs and transmission-related spending. The agreement covers 2015 through 2017 and continues the productive multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. 
In March, the PSCo filed a multiyear natural gas rate case covering 2015 through 2017. We are requesting a 2015 rate increase of about $41 million and subsequent step increases of $8 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2017. The requested ROE is 10.1% in 2015 and '16, rising to 10.3% in 2017. In addition, we filed for a 5-year extension of our Pipeline System Integrity rider that drives revenue increases of $22 million and $21 million in 2016 and '17. We filed a gas case with principles generally consistent with the recently settled electric case, which we hope will provide the framework for our first multiyear natural gas rate plan in Colorado. 
In our Texas rate case, the schedule has been -- had been abated for 30 days in order to allow for settlement discussions. However, we haven't been successful in reaching a settlement. Therefore, the procedure's schedule to process the case was established on Monday. Regardless, the parties have agreed rates will be effective in mid-June. 
Finally, in South Dakota, interim rates of about $16 million went into effect on January 1. We currently are in settlement negotiations with parties and expect final rates to be effective midyear. 
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed. For more information, please see our earnings release. 
With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are pleased to be making progress with our regulatory agenda. We have gained substantial clarity in recent months and are cautiously optimistic regarding the potential success of our legislative initiatives. We are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are excited about the Courtenay Wind Farm investment opportunity.

And more importantly, so we had this issue in Colorado earlier that regulators then didn't necessarily think that this -- that the new law is really binding. It's more of a suggestion. So how likely is it that we do get a bill and then the regulators in Minnesota think that it's still an option for them to pursue or not, and then we may end up in yet another rate case?"

I mean, first of all, as we all know, sausage-making and the political process can be kind of messy. And that's what we're in. And I -- and -- but what we're being told and what we understand is while there's controversy between the House and Senate bill, and that's the difference between Republican versus DFL-controlled and their different interests, the multiyear plan provisions really aren't controversial. So when this thing goes to conference committee, we think it's a very good possibility that the provisions of the multiyear plan remain. While you can only be cautiously optimistic because it is a political process and if there were things in the final bill that was passed by both House and Senate that were unappealing to the governor, you always have a risk of veto. So that's the reality there. In terms of whether it will be viewed by the commission as an option versus a mandate, I think, one, you'd have to look and see how the legislation is finalized. But I also believe that the commission is frustrated with how the process works in Minnesota, too. So I think you kind of saw that as the commission was thinking about the opportunity that we said to stay out of 2016. And I'm not sure that they felt they were -- it was quite ready. And so with legislation, even if it's an option versus a mandate, I think they'd feel much more comfortable with that. Chris -- we have Chris Clark here.

Today, I'm going to provide a business update and discuss our recent legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas. Later, Terrace will provide more detail on some of our recent regulatory decisions and financial drivers.
We reported $0.39 for the quarter, flat with last year. Overall, we've had a solid first half of 2015, with results generally in line with our expectations. While we have some challenges from lower-than-expected sales, unfavorable weather and additional adjustments from the Monticello proceeding, we fully expect to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.
I want to start by saying how pleased I am with the company's response to recent storms across our Minnesota and Wisconsin service territories. 2 weekends ago, intense winds with speeds between 70 to 80 miles per hour knocked out serviced for 250,000 customers. Our employees in the field responded quickly and effectively, restoring 75% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% within 45 hours. All of our customers were restored to power within 3 days. This event is not yet another reminder of the company's top-tier storm restoration efforts and illustrates the value of building a resilient system.
We also hit several additional operational milestones during the quarter, that I wanted to share with you. Beginning with our Monticello nuclear facility, we are very happy to report that this month we received NRC concurrence and reached 671 megawatts of generation. The facility is now fully in service, operating at a designed capacity and meets all the requirements of the Minnesota Commission to be considered used and useful.
Finally, our Cherokee combined cycle natural gas plant in Colorado successfully completed its first fire on gas and is on time and on budget. Last year, we spoke to you about our refocused strategic plan with a key tenant being improving the performance of our utilities and reducing the ROE gap. Our approach was to target the jurisdiction where the gap was the greatest and seek legislation in those states to improve the timeliness and method of cost recovery.
Beginning with Minnesota, last month the Governor signed into law a build that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multi-year plans to up to 5 years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for the recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index, and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid monetization. We are now considering how to include these improved mechanisms in our Minnesota rate case filing scheduled for later this year.
In Texas, we along with several other non-ERCOT utilities sponsored legislation that will reduce regulatory lag and provides for improved inclusion of post test year capital additions, more timely implementation of new rates. And great a flexibility and more timely recovery of new natural gas plant investments. The Governor signed The Bill last month, and while this does not eliminate all regulatory lag in Texas, it does represent an important incremental step towards improvement.
We feel the legislation in both Minnesota and Texas strengthens the regulatory compact, helps to close the ROE gap and enhances our ability to meet our long-term earnings growth objectives.
Moving to Colorado, we anticipate that the Colorado Commission will be scheduling informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. We continue to see the value of these types of investments for our customers, particularly when considering the current low-price commodity environment. After the information meetings are held, we plan to make a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework that incorporates feedback from the meetings.  Following the commission's decision on a preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016.
In Minnesota, we were pleased to see the Minnesota Commission supported our settlement with smaller solar developers, which limits the size of proposed solar gardens to no more than 5 megawatts. This is important policy settlement ensures that Minnesota has one of the largest community solar gardens in the country rather, but also minimizes the impact of the program on our customers' bills. Xcel Energy continues to be a major advocate of solar and we view it as an important and growing component of our resource mix. However, we want to ensure that it's done at the most attractive price point for our customers. A couple of recent studies confirm that utility scale solar is far more effective for consumers than smaller applications, and we think it's important that policy be based on these sound economics.
So while solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy subsidization from nonparticipants, you will continue to see us advocate that the primary focus be on utility scale solar so that we can keep energy cost affordable for consumers as we move to clean our energy sources.
So I think we made significant progress during the first half of the year. We look forward to implementing some of these new mechanisms and policies in the coming months.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Teresa."

Today we reported ongoing earnings for the second quarter of $0.39 per share, flat with last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were: improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to new rates and higher rider revenue driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. These incremental revenues were partially offset by unfavorable weather and lower sales. Additionally, offsetting the higher electric margin with increased depreciation, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. Each of these items separately had a negative $0.02 per share impact on earnings.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 4 tenths of a percent, driven primarily by declines in the residential class, partially offset by modest growth in the C&I class. Regardless, we continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 4% compared to a national rate of 5.5%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%.
The decline in residential sales is driven by lower customer usage. We believe this trend is due to a combination of factors, including appliance efficiency, conservation efforts, and an increase in multiunit dwellings. We have adjusted our an annual electric sales guidance to reflect year-to-date results, which lowers our expected growth rate for 2015 to about 0.5%. We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage, and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a long-term trend. 
It is important to note that we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I class in Minnesota in 2016, which will offset any decline in customer usage trend.
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Earlier this month, we received decisions on several outstanding items under reconsideration in our Minnesota electric rate case and our Monticello prudence proceeding. The commission allowed NSP-Minnesota to recover its 2015 rate increase beginning in early March and determined that the Monticello extended power operate investment was not used and useful until certain NRC conditions were met. These conditions were met in early July. While we believe that the commission should have concluded differently related to the in-service date of the Monticello project, we will review the written order to determine our next steps.
In Colorado, last month, we received inventory intervenor testimony to our PSCo Multi-year natural gas rate case. The staff recommended a rate decrease, while the office of consumer Council recommended a modest rate increase. Primary differences between the company and other parties were driven by ROE, capital structure, and whether to use a historical test year in the establishment of base rates.
The positions recommended by the staff in the OTC were consistent with past positions and we remain confident we will reach a constructive outcome in the case.
Finally, I wanted to address our rate case in New Mexico. After another utility in the state had its case dismissed, the New Mexico commission determined our filing also did not comply with their new interpretation of the statute regarding forward test years and the timing of rate case submissions. As a result, the commission dismissed our case as well. We believe our filings was consistent with the requirements of the New Mexico legislation that allows for a forward test year and have appealed to the state Supreme Court. While the timing of resolution is uncertain, we plan to refile the case later this year.
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range due to the timing of O&M expenses and revenue recognition from the Minnesota rate case, both of which will provide a more favorable comparison in the second half of the year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed.
With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are very pleased with the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas during the quarter. The new legislation provides a framework that will allow us to reduce regulatory lag and streamline the regulatory process. As a result, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of reducing the ROE gap by 50 basis points by 2018.
Growth projects like the Courtenay Wind Farm are on schedule. We remain on track to limit increases in O&M to 0% to 2% for 2015. The company is well positioned to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually and our dividend at 5% to 7%.  And finally, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.
So operator, we will now ask take questions."

If you're looking at the charts, by the way, that were addressed, keep in mind that that's a little bit distorted due to some revenue recognition. But you're right, it's been in the mid-date, and we need to improve that. Take a look at what we did in Colorado. When you get into a multi-year plan, I think you've got a much better shot at closing that ROE gap. You're getting all of your capital recovery, you're getting your O&M potentially recovered and I think, Travis, the other thing that I think is so important about entering into into these multi-year plans is, it gives you an opportunity to communicate more frequently with your commissions around important policy decisions, resource plans decisions. Where we want to go with our portfolio generation, et cetera. So you don't get disconnects. And I think if you look at why we've under earned, we've had a lot of CapEx going through a funnel. We had a to relicense our nuclear plants. We had some challenges there as everyone in the industry did. And we didn't have a lot of forums to communicate some of those challenges. So it's not only the mechanisms associated with the legislation in the multi-your plan, it's kind of what that frees you up to do. And I'm really optimistic that we will make good progress next year and in the years to come."

Today, I'm going to provide a business update and discuss our recent legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas. Later, Teresa will provide more detail on some of our recent regulatory decisions and financial drivers.
We reported $0.39 for the quarter, flat with last year. Overall, we've had a solid first half of 2015, with results generally in line with our expectations. While we've had some challenges from lower-than-expected sales, unfavorable weather and additional adjustments from the Monticello proceeding, we fully expect to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.
I want to start by saying how pleased I am with the company's response to recent storms across our Minnesota and Wisconsin service territories. 2 weekends ago, intense winds with speeds between 70 to 80 miles per hour knocked out service for 250,000 customers. Our employees in the field responded quickly and effectively, restoring 75% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% within 45 hours. All of our customers were restored to power within 3 days. This event is yet another reminder of the company's top-tier storm restoration efforts and illustrates the value of building a resilient system.
We also hit several additional operational milestones during the quarter, that I wanted to share with you. Beginning with our Monticello nuclear facility, we are very happy to report that this month we received NRC concurrence and reached 671 megawatts of generation. The facility is now fully in service, operating at designed capacity and meets all the requirements of the Minnesota Commission to be considered used and useful.
Finally, our Cherokee combined-cycle natural gas plant in Colorado successfully completed its first fire on gas and is on time and on budget. Last year, we spoke to you about our refocused strategic plan with a key tenant being improving the performance of our utilities and reducing the ROE gap. Our approach was to target the jurisdiction where the gap was the greatest and seek legislation in those states to improve the timeliness and method of cost recovery.
Beginning with Minnesota, last month the Governor signed into law a bill that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multi-year plans to up to 5 years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for the recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index, and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid modernization. We're now considering how to include these improved mechanisms in our Minnesota rate case filing scheduled for later this year.
In Texas, we along with several other non-ERCOT utilities sponsored legislation that will reduce regulatory lag and provides for improved inclusion of post test year capital additions, more timely implementation of new rates. And greater flexibility and more timely recovery of new natural gas plant investments. The Governor signed the bill last month, and while this does not eliminate all regulatory lag in Texas, it does represent an important incremental step towards improvement.
We feel the legislation in both Minnesota and Texas strengthens the regulatory compact, helps to close the ROE gap and enhances our ability to meet our long-term earnings growth objectives.
Moving to Colorado, we anticipate that the Colorado Commission will be scheduling informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. We continue to see the value of these types of investments for our customers, particularly when considering the current low-price commodity environment. After the information meetings are held, we plan to make a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework that incorporates feedback from the meetings.  Following the commission's decision on a preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016.
In Minnesota, we were pleased to see the Minnesota Commission supported our settlement with smaller solar developers, which limits the size of proposed solar gardens to no more than 5 megawatts. This important policy settlement ensures that Minnesota has one of the largest community solar gardens in the country rather, but also minimizes the impact of the program on our customers' bills. Xcel Energy continues to be a major advocate of solar and we view it as an important and growing component of our resource mix. However, we want to ensure that it's done at the most attractive price point for our customers. A couple of recent studies confirm that utility scale solar is far more cost effective for consumers than smaller applications, and we think it's important that policy be based on these sound economics.
So while solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy subsidization from nonparticipants, you will continue to see us advocate that the primary focus be on utility scale solar, so that we can keep energy cost affordable for consumers as we move to cleaner energy sources.
So I think we've made significant progress during the first half of the year. We look forward to implementing some of these new mechanisms and policies in the coming months.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Teresa."

Today we reported ongoing earnings for the second quarter of $0.39 per share, flat with last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were: improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to new rates and higher rider revenue driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. These incremental revenues were partially offset by unfavorable weather and lower sales. Additionally, offsetting the higher electric margin with increased depreciation, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. Each of these items separately had a negative $0.02 per share impact on earnings.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.04%, driven primarily by declines in the residential class, partially offset by modest growth in the C&I class. Regardless, we continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 4% compared to a national rate of 5.5%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%.
The decline in residential sales is driven by lower customer usage. We believe this trend is due to a combination of factors, including appliance efficiency, conservation efforts, and an increase in multi-unit dwellings. We have adjusted our an annual electric sales guidance to reflect year-to-date results, which lowers our expected growth rate for 2015 to about 0.5%. We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage, and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a long-term trend. 
It is important to note that we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I class in Minnesota in 2016, which will offset any decline in customer usage trend.
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Earlier this month, we received decisions on several outstanding items under reconsideration in our Minnesota electric rate case and our Monticello prudence proceeding. The commission allowed NSP-Minnesota to recover its 2015 rate increase beginning in early March and determined that the Monticello extended power operate investment was not used and useful until certain NRC conditions were met. These conditions were met in early July. While we believe that the commission should have concluded differently related to the in-service date of the Monticello project, we will review the written order to determine our next steps.
In Colorado, last month, we received intervenor testimony in our PSCo multi-year natural gas rate case. The staff recommended a rate decrease, while the Office of Consumer Council recommended a modest rate increase. Primary differences between the company and other parties were driven by ROE, capital structure, and whether to use a historical test year in the establishment of base rates.
The positions recommended by the staff in the OTC were consistent with past positions and we remain confident we will reach a constructive outcome in the case.
Finally, I wanted to address our rate case in New Mexico. After another utility in the state had its case dismissed, the New Mexico commission determined our filing also did not comply with their new interpretation of the statute regarding forward test years and the timing of rate case submissions. As a result, the commission dismissed our case as well. We believe our filings was consistent with the requirements of the New Mexico legislation that allows for a forward test year and have appealed to the state Supreme Court. While the timing of resolution is uncertain, we plan to refile the case later this year.
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range due to the timing of O&M expenses and revenue recognition from the Minnesota rate case, both of which will provide for a more favorable comparison in the second half of the year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed.
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. We are very pleased with the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas during the quarter. The new legislation provides a framework that will allow us to reduce regulatory lag and streamline the regulatory process. As a result, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of reducing the ROE gap by 50 basis points by 2018.
Growth projects like the Courtenay Wind Farm are on schedule. We remain on track to limit increases in O&M to 0% to 2% for 2015. The company is well positioned to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually and our dividend at 5% to 7%.  And finally, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.
So operator, we will now take questions."

If you're looking at the charts, by the way, that were attached, keep in mind that that's a little bit distorted due to some revenue recognition. But you're right, it's been in the mid-8s, and we need to improve that. Take a look at what we did in Colorado. When you get into a multi-year plan, I think you've got a much better shot at closing that ROE gap. You're getting all of your capital recovery, you're getting your O&M potentially recovered and I think, Travis, the other thing that I think is so important about entering into these multi-year plans is, it gives you an opportunity to communicate more frequently with your commissions around important policy decisions, resource plans decisions. What -- where we want to go with our portfolio of generation, et cetera. So you don't get disconnects. And I think if you look at why we've under earned, we've had a lot of CapEx going through a funnel. We had a to relicense our nuclear plants. We had some challenges there as everyone in the industry did. And we didn't have a lot of forums to communicate some of those challenges. So it's not only the mechanisms associated with the legislation in the multi-year plan, it's kind of what that frees you up to do.

Today, I'm going to provide a business update and discuss our recent legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas. Later, Teresa will provide more detail on some of our recent regulatory decisions and financial drivers.
We reported $0.39 for the quarter, flat with last year. Overall, we've had a solid first half of 2015, with results generally in line with our expectations. While we've had some challenges from lower-than-expected sales, unfavorable weather and additional adjustments from the Monticello proceeding, we fully expect to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.
I want to start by saying how pleased I am with the company's response to recent storms across our Minnesota and Wisconsin service territories. 2 weekends ago, intense winds with speeds between 70 to 80 miles per hour knocked out service for 250,000 customers. Our employees in the field responded quickly and effectively, restoring 75% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% within 45 hours. All of our customers were restored to power within 3 days. This event is yet another reminder of the company's top-tier storm restoration efforts and illustrates the value of building a resilient system.
We also hit several additional operational milestones during the quarter, that I wanted to share with you. Beginning with our Monticello nuclear facility, we are very happy to report that this month we received NRC concurrence and reached 671 megawatts of generation. The facility is now fully in service, operating at designed capacity and meets all the requirements of the Minnesota Commission to be considered used and useful.
Finally, our Cherokee combined-cycle natural gas plant in Colorado successfully completed its first fire on gas and is on time and on budget. Last year, we spoke to you about our refocused strategic plan with a key tenet being improving the performance of our utilities and reducing the ROE gap. Our approach was to target the jurisdiction where the gap was the greatest and seek legislation in those states to improve the timeliness and method of cost recovery.
Beginning with Minnesota, last month the Governor signed into law a bill that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multi-year plans to up to 5 years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for the recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index, and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid modernization. We're now considering how to include these improved mechanisms in our Minnesota rate case filing scheduled for later this year.
In Texas, we along with several other non-ERCOT utilities sponsored legislation that will reduce regulatory lag and provides for improved inclusion of post test year capital additions, more timely implementation of new rates and greater flexibility and more timely recovery of new natural gas plant investments. The Governor signed the bill last month, and while this does not eliminate all regulatory lag in Texas, it does represent an important incremental step towards improvement.
We feel the legislation in both Minnesota and Texas strengthens the regulatory compact, helps to close the ROE gap and enhances our ability to meet our long-term earnings growth objectives.
Moving to Colorado, we anticipate that the Colorado Commission will be scheduling informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. We continue to see the value of these types of investments for our customers, particularly when considering the current low-price commodity environment. After the information meetings are held, we plan to make a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework that incorporates feedback from the meetings.  Following the commission's decision on a preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016.
In Minnesota, we were pleased to see the Minnesota Commission supported our settlement with smaller solar developers, which limits the size of proposed solar gardens to no more than 5 megawatts. This important policy settlement ensures that Minnesota has one of the largest community solar gardens in the country rather, but also minimizes the impact of the program on our customers' bills. Xcel Energy continues to be a major advocate of solar and we view it as an important and growing component of our resource mix. However, we want to ensure that it's done at the most attractive price point for our customers. A couple of recent studies confirm that utility scale solar is far more cost effective for consumers than smaller applications, and we think it's important that policy be based on these sound economics.
So while solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy subsidization from nonparticipants, you will continue to see us advocate that the primary focus be on utility scale solar, so that we can keep energy cost affordable for consumers as we move to cleaner energy sources.
So I think we've made significant progress during the first half of the year. We look forward to implementing some of these new mechanisms and policies in the coming months.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Teresa."

Today we reported ongoing earnings for the second quarter of $0.39 per share, flat with last year.

Today we reported ongoing earnings for the second quarter of $0.39 per share, flat with last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were: improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to new rates and higher rider revenue driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. These incremental revenues were partially offset by unfavorable weather and lower sales. Additionally, offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. Each of these items separately had a negative $0.02 per share impact on earnings.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.04%, driven primarily by declines in the residential class, partially offset by modest growth in the C&I class. Regardless, we continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 4% compared to a national rate of 5.5%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%.
The decline in residential sales is driven by lower customer usage. We believe this trend is due to a combination of factors, including appliance efficiency, conservation efforts, and an increase in multi-unit dwellings. We have adjusted our annual electric sales guidance to reflect year-to-date results, which lowers our expected growth rate for 2015 to about 0.5%. We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage, and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a long-term trend. 
It is important to note that we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I class in Minnesota in 2016, which will offset any decline in customer usage trend.
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Earlier this month, we received decisions on several outstanding items under reconsideration in our Minnesota electric rate case and our Monticello prudence proceeding. The commission allowed NSP-Minnesota to recover its 2015 rate increase beginning in early March and determined that the Monticello extended power uprate investment was not used and useful until certain NRC conditions were met. These conditions were met in early July. While we believe that the commission should have concluded differently related to the in-service date of the Monticello project, we will review the written order to determine our next steps.
In Colorado, last month we received intervenor testimony in our PSCo multi-year natural gas rate case. The staff recommended a rate decrease, while the Office of Consumer Council recommended a modest rate increase. Primary differences between the company and other parties were driven by ROE, capital structure, and whether to use a historical test year in the establishment of base rates.
The positions recommended by the staff in the OTC were consistent with past positions and we remain confident we will reach a constructive outcome in the case.
Finally, I wanted to address our rate case in New Mexico. After another utility in the state had its case dismissed, the New Mexico commission determined our filing also did not comply with their new interpretation of the statute regarding forward test years and the timing of rate case submissions. As a result, the commission dismissed our case as well. We believe our filing was consistent with the requirements of the New Mexico legislation that allows for a forward test year and have appealed to the state Supreme Court. While the timing of resolution is uncertain, we plan to refile the case later this year.
This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range due to the timing of O&M expenses and revenue recognition from the Minnesota rate case, both of which will provide for a more favorable comparison in the second half of the year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed.
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. We are very pleased with the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas during the quarter. The new legislation provides a framework that will allow us to reduce regulatory lag and streamline the regulatory process. As a result, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of reducing the ROE gap by 50 basis points by 2018.
Growth projects like the Courtenay Wind Farm are on schedule. We remain on track to limit increases in O&M to 0% to 2% for 2015. The company is well positioned to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually and our dividend at 5% to 7%.  And finally, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.
So operator, we will now take questions."

If you're looking at the charts, by the way, that were attached, keep in mind that that's a little bit distorted due to some revenue recognition. But you're right, it's been in the mid-8s, and we need to improve that. Take a look at what we did in Colorado. When you get into a multi-year plan, I think you've got a much better shot at closing that ROE gap. You're getting all of your capital recovery, you're getting your O&M potentially recovered and I think, Travis, the other thing that I think is so important about entering into these multi-year plans is, it gives you an opportunity to communicate more frequently with your commissions around important policy decisions, resource plans decisions. What -- where we want to go with our portfolio of generation, et cetera. So you don't get disconnects. And I think if you look at why we've underearned, we've had a lot of CapEx going through a funnel. We had a to relicense our nuclear plants. We had some challenges there as everyone in the industry did. And we didn't have a lot of forums to communicate some of those challenges. So it's not only the mechanisms associated with the legislation in the multi-year plan, it's kind of what that frees you up to do. And I'm really -- I'm optimistic that we will make good progress next year and in the years to come."

Today, we reported earnings of $0.84 for the quarter, which was $0.11 per share higher than last year. With 9 months of the year completed, we're very confident in our ability to hit our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance and are narrowing the range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. We're also initiating 2016 ongoing earnings guidance to $2.12 to $2.27 per share. As we previously discussed, legislation was passed this in Minnesota, that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multiyear plans throughout the 5 years, allows for more approach to recovering capital investments, provides for recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index and allows wider recovery of distribution cost that facilitate grid modernization. Earlier in September, I have the opportunity to discuss with the Minnesota Commission and other stakeholders, our vision of the future for the utility industry. The vision I outlined included adding cost-effective renewables to our system, adopting new technology like battery storage, modernizing our distribution grid, make it more resilient and ready for 2-way energy flows, becoming more consumer centric and offering additional products, options and services that our customers want, changing our fleet to position us for the future, address the Clean Power Plan and significantly reduce carbon emissions. I also discussed the recently passed legislation that gives us a new set of tools to use as we look to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future while providing significant benefit for consumers, investors and policymakers. 
Multiyear plan provides greater certainty and transparency for both the company and our customers. It also provides a longer runway to transform our cost structure and allows us to address significant energy policy issues, which can be difficult to do when you're in a litigated rate case proceeding. Overall, I appreciated the opportunity and thought the meeting went well. Consistent with our vision of the future, we recently filed an update to our Minnesota resource plan. The proposed plan now achieves a 60% carbon reduction for the NSP system by 2030 and includes the following key components: the retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023, Sherco Unit 1 in 2026, the addition of 800 megawatts of wind and 400 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2016 and 2020, the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and 1,000 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2020 and 2030. And finally, the addition of 230-megawatt combustion turbine unit in North Dakota and a 780-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Sherco site in the mid 2020s. This is an exciting plan that has widespread stakeholders support. It also is a continuation of our proactive environmental leadership strategy, which leaves us well-positioned to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. And I believe this plan will create ownership opportunities for Xcel Energy as well. 
The recently passed legislation proactive resource plan filing and our plans to file a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota are all part of our strategy to streamline the regulatory process, so we can focus on longer-term energy policy issues. In early November, we planned to file a rate case in Minnesota. The rate case is driven by capital investment and will incorporate key provisions of a legislation into the filing. While we won't discuss the specifics of the request prior to the filing, I do want to provide you with the overall framework of the case. We're filing a 3-year multiyear rate plan. We're also providing an option to extend that 3-year plan to 5 years. In addition, we will be requesting interim rates for both 2016 and 2017. While the case could take over a year to complete, we are going to see if we can settle the case or offer mediation to shorten the time frame to reach the final decision. I believe in combination of legislation, the resource plan filing stay reach and the optionality of the multiyear plan filing put us in excellent position to achieve a constructive outcome in the Minnesota rate case. 
Now let me focus on investment opportunities. We've previously discussed our plans to step in into the development of Courtenay Wind project. During the quarter, we received approvals from both the Minnesota and the North Dakota commission. As a result, we're moving forward with the project, which will now be included in rate base versus the PPA, which was the original plan. Now, this is an example of our steel for fuel strategy where we take a pass-through cost, move it in a rate base and cause a minimal if no impact to the customer bill. 
Next let me give you a quick update on our efforts to rate base natural gas reserves. In August and September, the Colorado Commission held informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. The meetings were very helpful and informative. We planned to submit a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework and incorporates feedback from the meetings. Following the commission's decision on the preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016. 
Finally, this week, SPS is filing to transfer about $100 million of transformation facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma from SPS to 1 of our transcos. SPS no longer provides retail electric service in Kansas and Oklahoma. So this is a good opportunity to see in 1 of our transcos with some assets. SPS will make various regulatory filings at both the state and federal levels and final approval is expected to take about a year. So you can see, it's been an exciting and successful quarter. I will now turn the call over to Teresa, who will provide more details on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the third quarter of $0.84 per share, which compares to a $0.73 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were: improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.14 per share, and was largely due to new rates and higher rider revenues driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. The incremental revenue also reflects the impact of favorable weather. Offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, lower AFUDC earnings, higher property taxes and higher interest expense. 
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather normalized electric sales were down two tenths of a percent, driven primarily by lower residential use per customer offset by customer growth. We continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 3.6% compared to a national rate of 5.1%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%. We have adjusted our electric sales consumption and now anticipate sales growth for 2015 reflecting our year-to-date results. We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a longer-term trend. It is important to note that in 2016, we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I customer classes in Minnesota, which should address any declining customer usage trend. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we have a pending natural gas rate case and we are waiting for an ALJ recommendation, which we should receive shortly. The commission is expected to roll in January 2016. As a reminder, interim rates were implemented in October. In New Mexico, we refiled our electric rate case with an increase of $45.4 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, and equity ratio of about 54% and a historical test adjusted for no new measurable changes. The commission decision and implementation of is anticipated in 2016. 
Finally, in our Texas electric rate case, in mid-October, we received the ALJ recommendation, which reflected a $1 million rate increase and compares to our requested increase of $42 million. The ALJ's recommendation was based on an ROE of 9.7% and an equity ratio of almost 54%. We reviewed the recommendations and believe there were errors in the filing. And therefore, sent a letter to notify the Texas Commission of our concerns. Late yesterday, the Texas staff revised the recommended rate increase to $14.4 million. Please note, that due to the timing of this update, our earnings release does not reflect this revised revenue recommendation. In addition, we have not had a chance to analyze this subsequent filing. The ALJ's recommendation are somewhat mixed. We prevailed on a number of key items such as cost allocation issues that is supported by the commission to establish solid and should eliminate these disputes in future proceeding. Unfortunately, the ALJ's recommendation did not vary from the historic test year and rejected our forward-looking adjustments proposed planned addition and SPP cost, which represented a significant portion of our request. We believe these adjustments relate to policy decision about the best way to alleviate regulatory lag, which needs to be addressed by the commission. While the commission isn't required to implement provisions of the recently passed legislation in this case, we remain helpful that the commission will be more open to addressing regulatory lag, taking into consideration the intent of the legislation and making it final decision in this case. The commission is expected to roll by year-end with new rates effective January 2016. 
In our earnings release today, we also announced today that we will start using market share purchase to fund our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs in 2016. This will eliminate an annual equity issuance of about $75 million and reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and projected cash flows. This morning, we're now 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. Previously, the range was $2 to $2.15 per share. We are also initiating our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. 
I'd also like to mention that we will be hosting an Analyst Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 3. At the meeting, we plan to update you on our plans to achieve our 50 basis point improvement and earned ROE, our regulatory plan, our plans to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, our 5-year capital forecast including potential incremental investment opportunities. And finally, we will update our rate base growth estimates and financing plan. 
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. We had an excellent quarter in our on-track delivered 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for 11 consecutive year. We are on track to deliver O&M consistent with our 0% to 2% objective. We initiated 2016 earnings guidance, which is in line with our 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate objective. We filed our revised resource plan in Minnesota, which is designed to reduce carbon on the NSP system by 60% by 2030. We have received all regulatory approvals for the Courtenay Wind Project. We completed the commission information on meetings on the rate basing of natural gas reserves in Colorado, we've made progress on several regulatory dockets and intended by our Minnesota multiyear rate case next week. Finally, we eliminated all equity issuances from our forecast beginning in 2016. So operator, with that, we'll now take questions."

It's basically it doesn't impact the customers very much. So to specifically answer your question obviously, when you look at 2030, or through 2030, it's going to depend upon what sort of assumptions you buy into. I think, we are in in gas prices are going to be pretty stable. I think, we are in environment where tech -- renewables are going to continue to fall, even if they are as supported robustly with level with ITC and PTC. So, really when I look at it, I think that meeting this -- exceeding the Clean Power Plan, reducing our emissions by 60% here in the upper Midwest, can be done over cumulative 15-year period, but no more than perhaps a 2% cumulative increase over that time frame, so negligible, right?
And so the real issue is going to be, can we build out infrastructure, can we do these other things and not have that pace exceed customer affordability, and I think the answer to that is yes, we can. Getting into multiyear compacts is the way you do that, cost control is the way you do that, discipline about your capital investments is the way you do that and we're spending a lot of time on that and I'm very confident that this plan is going to be affordable.
Travis, I'll just to say all you got to do is look at some of the wind assets and other assets we're bringing on there. They were right on parity with  Basel and I think they will be 2 even with the expiration of tax credits."

So could we do more, sure. And we're going to -- our stated goal is to grow the dividend at 5% to 7%. We have a lot of runway. But right now, that's where we're focused on 4% to 6% EPS growth, 5% to 7% dividend growth. If we at the upper end of our EPS growth rate, we'll never really exceed that 60%, which states that the payout ratio today would stay about the same, which will give us more flexibility. So it's really, I think great position to have a lot of levers to reward shareholders. And one of the things everybody worries about is rising interest rates.

Now compare that Paul to what we could go out today and buy a strip of natural gas future contracts for. Even in this low gas price environment, a few took those gas reserves, took at times rate I think you find $25 a megawatt hour for win on parity in the money. So essentially, what we're doing we're buying wind hedging natural gas volatility. Now, obviously if you take away $22 from the equation, you're not looking at $25 you're looking at $47 little bit out of the money. Of course, natural gas prices are at historic lows. And then I would say that this applies to solar as well they continue these technologies at large scale to become more and more efficient. And so, I don't think their prices are going to go up. I think if wind flat, but caution just 5 years, we've seen capacity factors go from mid-30s to now but low 50s. They've seen steady improvements, we all know the story with solar.

Today, we reported earnings of $0.84 for the quarter, which was $0.11 per share higher than last year. With 9 months of the year completed, we're very confident in our ability to hit our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance and are narrowing the range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. We're also initiating 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share.
As we've previously discussed, legislation was passed this year in Minnesota. That contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multiyear plans to up to 5 years, allows for a more formulated approach to recovering capital investments, provides for a recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index and allows rider recovery of distribution cost that facilitate grid modernization.
Earlier in September, I have the opportunity to discuss with the Minnesota Commission and other stakeholders our vision of the future for the utility industry. The vision I outlined included adding cost-effective renewables to our system; adopting new technology like battery storage; modernizing our distribution grid, making it more resilient and ready for 2-way energy flows; becoming more consumer-centric and offering additional products, options and services that our customers want; change in our fleet to position us for the future; address the Clean Power Plan and significantly reduce carbon emissions. I also discussed the recently passed legislation that gives us a new set of tools to use as we look to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future while providing significant benefit for consumers, investors and policymakers. 
Multiyear plan provides greater certainty and transparency for both the company and our customers. It also provides a longer runway to transform our cost structure and allows us to address significant energy policy issues, which can be difficult to do when you're in a litigated rate case proceeding. Overall, I appreciated the opportunity and felt the meeting went well.
Consistent with our vision of the future, we recently filed an update to our Minnesota resource plan. The proposed plan now achieves a 60% carbon reduction for the NSP system by 2030 and includes the following key components: the retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023, Sherco Unit 1 in 2026; the addition of 800 megawatts of wind and 400 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2016 and 2020; the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and 1,000 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2020 and 2030; and finally, the addition of a 230-megawatt combustion turbine unit in North Dakota and a 780-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Sherco site in the mid-2020s. Well, this is an exciting plan that has widespread stakeholders support. It also is a continuation of our proactive environmental leadership strategy, which leaves us well positioned to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. And I believe this plan will create ownership opportunities for Xcel Energy as well. 
The recently passed legislation, our proactive resource plan filing and our plans to file a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota are all part of our strategy to streamline the regulatory process so we can focus on longer-term energy policy issues. In early November, we plan to file a rate case in Minnesota. The rate case is driven by capital investment and will incorporate key provisions of the legislation into the filing.
While we won't discuss the specifics of the request prior to the filing, I do want to provide you with the overall framework of the case. We're filing a 3-year multiyear rate plan, while also providing an option to extend that 3-year plan to 5 years. In addition, we will be requesting interim rates for both 2016 and 2017. While the case could take over a year to complete, we are going to see if we can settle the case or offer mediation to shorten the time frame to reach a final decision. I believe the combination of a legislation, the resource plan filing, stakeholder outreach and the optionality of the multiyear plan filing put us in excellent position to achieve a constructive outcome in the Minnesota rate case. 
So now let me focus on investment opportunities. We have previously discussed our plans to step in to the development of Courtenay Wind project. During the quarter, we received approvals from both the Minnesota and the North Dakota commission. As a result, we're moving forward with the project, which will now be included in rate base versus the PPA, which was the original plan. Now this is an example of our steel for fuel strategy, where we take a pass-through cost and move it into rate base and cause a minimal, if no, impact to the customer bill. 
Next let me give you a quick update on our efforts to rate base natural gas reserves. In August and September, the Colorado Commission held informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. The meetings were very helpful and informative. We plan to submit a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework and incorporates feedback from the meetings. Following the commission's decision on the preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016. 
Finally, this week, SPS is filing to transfer about $100 million of transmission facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma from SPS to one of our transcos. SPS no longer provides retail electric service in Kansas and Oklahoma so this is a good opportunity to seed 1 of our transcos with some assets. SPS will make various regulatory filings at both the state and federal levels, and final approval is expected to take about a year.
So you can see it's been an exciting and successful quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Teresa, who will provide more details on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"
527542,313026164,886377,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning.Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the third quarter of $0.84 per share, which compares with $0.73 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earning",962,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning.
Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the third quarter of $0.84 per share, which compares with $0.73 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.14 per share and was largely due to new rates and higher rider revenues driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. The incremental revenue also reflects the impact of favorable weather. Offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, lower AFUDC earnings, higher property taxes and higher interest expense. 
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.2%, driven primarily by lower residential use per customer, partially offset by customer growth. We continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 3.6% compared to a national rate of 5.1%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%. We have adjusted our electric sales consumption, and now we anticipate flat sales growth for 2015, reflecting our year-to-date results.
We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a longer-term trend. It is important to note that in 2016, we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I customer classes in Minnesota, which should address any declining customer usage trend. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we have a pending natural gas rate case, and we are waiting for an ALJ recommendation, which we should receive shortly. The commission is expected to rule in January 2016. As a reminder, interim rates were implemented in October. In New Mexico, we refiled our electric rate case, which seeks an increase of $45.4 million based on an ROE of 10.25% and equity ratio of about 54% and a historical test year adjusted for known and measurable changes. A commission decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in 2016. 
Finally, in our Texas electric rate case, in mid-October, we received the ALJ recommendations, which reflected a $1 million rate increase and compares to our requested increase of $42 million. The ALJ's recommendation was based on an ROE of 9.7% and an equity ratio of almost 54%.
We reviewed the recommendations and believe there were errors in the filing, and therefore, sent a letter to notify the Texas Commission of our concerns. Late yesterday, the Texas staff revised the recommended rate increase to $14.4 million.
Please note, that due to the timing of this update, our earnings release does not reflect this revised revenue recommendation. In addition, we have not had a chance to analyze this subsequent filing.
The ALJ's recommendations are somewhat mixed. We prevailed on a number of key items, such as cost allocation issues, that if supported by the commission will establish solid precedent and should eliminate these disputes in future proceedings. Unfortunately, the ALJ's recommendation did not vary from the historic test year precedence and rejected our forward-looking adjustments, proposed test year planned additions and the SPP cost, which represented a significant portion of our request. We believe these adjustments relate to policy decisions about the best way to alleviate regulatory lag, which needs to be addressed by the commission. While the commission isn't required to implement provisions of the recently passed legislation in this case, we remain hopeful that the commission will be more open to addressing regulatory lag, taking into consideration the intent of the legislation and making it the final decision in this case. The commission is expected to rule by year-end, with the new rates effective by January 2016. 
In our earnings release today, we also announced that we will start using market share purchase to fund our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs in 2016. This will eliminate an annual equity issuance of about $75 million and reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and projected cash flows. This morning, we are now 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. Previously, the range was $2 to $2.15 per share. We are also initiating our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. 
I would also like to mention that we will be hosting an Analyst Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 3. At the meeting, we plan to update you on our plans to achieve our 50-basis-point improvement and earned ROE; our regulatory plan; our plans to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan; our 5-year capital forecast, including potential incremental investment opportunities; and finally, we will update our rate base growth estimates and financing plan. 
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. We had an excellent quarter and are on track to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for 11th consecutive year. We are on track to deliver O&M consistent with our 0% to 2% objective. We initiated 2016 earnings guidance, which is in line with our 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate objective. We filed our revised resource plan in Minnesota, which is designed to reduce carbon on the NSP system by 60% by 2030. We have received all regulatory approvals for the Courtenay Wind project. We completed the commission informational meeting on the rate basing of natural gas reserves in Colorado. We've made progress on several regulatory dockets and intend to file our Minnesota multiyear rate case next week. Finally, we eliminated all equity issuances from our forecast beginning in 2016.
So operator, with that, we'll now take questions."

So to specifically answer your question, obviously, when you look at 2030 -- or through 2030, it's going to depend upon what set of assumptions you buy into. I think, we're in an environment where gas prices are going to be pretty stable. I think, we're in an environment where tech -- renewables are going to continue to fall, even if they're as supported robustly with -- at the federal level with ITC and PTC. So really, when I look at it, I think that meeting this -- exceeding the Clean Power Plan, reducing our emissions by 60% here in the upper Midwest can be done over a cumulative 15-year period, but no more than perhaps a 2% cumulative increase over that time frame. So negligible, right? And so the real issue is going to be can we build out infrastructure? Can we do these other things and not have that pace exceed customer affordability? And I think the answer to that is yes, we can. Getting in to multiyear compacts is the way you do that. Cost control is the way you do that. Discipline about your capital investments is the way you do that. And we're spending a lot of time on that, and I'm very confident this plan is going to be affordable.

I'd take a little bit of -- or argue a little bit. I think we got a pretty robust capital forecast ahead of us, and I'm very optimistic beyond the 5-year plan. We'll continue ahead of that pipeline as we implement Clean Power Plans and other things across all of our service territory. And we will give you some more clarity on that at our Analyst Day. So could we do more? Sure. And we're going to -- our stated goal is to grow the dividend at 5% to 7%. We have a lot of runway. But -- I mean, right now, that's what we're focused on: a 4% to 6% EPS growth, 5% to 7% dividend growth. If we are at the upper end of our EPS growth rate, we'll never really exceed that 60%. It would state that the payout ratio today would stay about the same, which would give us more flexibility. So it's really -- I think we're kind of in a great position to have a lot of levers to reward shareholders. And one of the things everybody worries about is rising interest rates, if and when that ever happens. It's great to be able to do more with your dividend to perhaps offset that risk, and we've got that flexibility."

And I'll stick with wind, which does enjoy the production tax credit, which is worth about $22 a megawatt hour. So with that credit in mind, we're seeing wind deals that have come to us across all of our regions in the mid-20s megawatt hour, levelized, 20 years. Now compare that, Paul, to what we could go out today and buy a strip of natural gas, future contracts for. I mean, even in this low gas-priced environment, if you took those gas reserves, took it, times it by the applicable heat rate, I think you'd find $25 a megawatt hour for wind to be on parity, if not, in the money. So essentially, what we're doing, why we're buying wind is hedging natural gas volatility. Now obviously, if you take away $22 from the equation, you're not looking at $25, you're looking at $47. It's a little bit out of the money. Of course, natural gas prices are at historic lows. And then I would say that -- and this applies to solar as well, is that they continue these technologies at large scale to become more and more efficient. And so I don't think their pricing's going to go up. I think if wind, if anything, will stay flat. But I mean, we've seen -- gosh, in just 5 years, we've seen capacity factors go from the mid-30s to now the low 50s. So they've seen steady improvements. We all know the story with solar. So I am optimistic about it."

And I'd be happy to talk to you more about it because I was just looking at that -- I used wind as an example because I think it's easy to get your arms around. Wind, today, you still have -- you still build a gas plant, right? Okay. But whether you fire up that gas plant with natural gas or you idle and have it ready to go, but you displaced that natural gas with wind is the equation I was talking to you about. It gets a little more complicated when we talk about solar. And the way I look at it briefly is it probably -- the capacity value that you bake into that is the difference between a combined cycle plant and a combustion turbine plant, roughly. I mean, there's -- it gets a little more complicated, and we probably can take it offline, but it's pretty exciting economics. And then you get the ancillary cost as you get more on the system. It's one of the reasons why we're studying more and more of batteries can do for us. It's not like batteries are in the money for us today, but neither was solar 10 years ago. And so we want to be ready for when those -- when the technology moves into the value part of our sweet spot."

This morning, we will update you on recent regulatory and business developments, review our 2015 third quarter results, discuss our 2015 and 2016 earnings guidance range. In addition, there are slides that accompany today's call that are available on our web page. We will also post a video on our website of Teresa summarizing the financial results.
As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Today, we reported earnings of $0.84 for the quarter, which was $0.11 per share higher than last year. With 9 months of the year completed, we're very confident in our ability to hit our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance and are narrowing the range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. We're also initiating 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share.
As we've previously discussed, legislation was passed this year in Minnesota that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multiyear plans to up to 5 years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for a recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid modernization.
Earlier in September, I had the opportunity to discuss with the Minnesota Commission and other stakeholders our vision of the future for the utility industry. The vision I outlined included adding cost-effective renewables to our system; adopting new technology, like battery storage; modernizing our distribution grid, making it more resilient and ready for 2-way energy flows; becoming more consumer-centric and offering additional products, options and services that our customers want; changing our fleet to position us for the future; address the Clean Power Plan and significantly reduce carbon emissions. I also discussed the recently passed legislation that gives us a new set of tools to use as we look to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future while providing significant benefit for consumers, investors and policymakers. 
Multiyear plan provides greater certainty and transparency for both the company and our customers. It also provides a longer runway to transform our cost structure and allows us to address significant energy policy issues, which can be difficult to do when you're in a litigated rate case proceeding. Overall, I appreciated the opportunity and felt the meeting went well.
Consistent with our vision of the future, we recently filed an update to our Minnesota resource plan. The proposed plan now achieves a 60% carbon reduction for the NSP system by 2030 and includes the following key components: the retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023, Sherco Unit 1 in 2026; the addition of 800 megawatts of wind and 400 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2016 and 2020; the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and 1,000 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2020 and 2030; and finally, the addition of a 230-megawatt combustion turbine unit in North Dakota and a 780-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Sherco site in the mid-2020s. Well, this is an exciting plan that has widespread stakeholders support. It also is a continuation of our proactive environmental leadership strategy, which leaves us well positioned to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. And I believe this plan will create ownership opportunities for Xcel Energy as well. 
The recently passed legislation, our proactive resource plan filing and our plans to file a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota are all part of our strategy to streamline the regulatory process so we can focus on longer-term energy policy issues. In early November, we plan to file a rate case in Minnesota. The rate case is driven by capital investment and will incorporate key provisions of the legislation into the filing.
While we won't discuss the specifics of the request prior to the filing, I do want to provide you with the overall framework of the case. We're filing a 3-year multiyear rate plan. We're also providing an option to extend that 3-year plan to 5 years. In addition, we will be requesting interim rates for both 2016 and 2017. While the case could take over a year to complete, we are going to see if we can settle the case or offer mediation to shorten the time frame to reach a final decision. I believe the combination of a legislation, the resource plan filing, stakeholder outreach and the optionality of the multiyear plan filing put us in excellent position to achieve a constructive outcome in the Minnesota rate case. 
So now let me focus on investment opportunities. We have previously discussed our plans to step in to the development of Courtenay Wind project. During the quarter, we received approvals from both the Minnesota and the North Dakota commission. As a result, we're moving forward with the project, which will now be included in rate base versus a PPA, which was the original plan. Now this is an example of our steal-for-fuel [ph] strategy, where we take a pass-through cost and move it into rate base and cause a minimal, if no, impact to the customer bill. 
Next let me give you a quick update on our efforts to rate base natural gas reserves. In August and September, the Colorado Commission held informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. The meetings were very helpful and informative. We plan to submit a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework and incorporates feedback from the meetings. Following the commission's decision on the preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016. 
Finally, this week, SPS is filing to transfer about $100 million of transmission facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma from SPS to one of our transcos. SPS no longer provides retail electric service in Kansas and Oklahoma, so this is a good opportunity to seed one of our transcos with some assets. SPS will make various regulatory filings at both the state and federal levels, and final approval is expected to take about a year.
So you can see it's been an exciting and successful quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Teresa, who will provide more details on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the third quarter of $0.84 per share, which compares with $0.73 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.14 per share and was largely due to new rates and higher rider revenues driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. The incremental revenue also reflects the impact of favorable weather. Offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, lower AFUDC earnings, higher property taxes and higher interest expense. 
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.2%, driven primarily by lower residential use per customer, partially offset by customer growth. We continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 3.6% compared to a national rate of 5.1%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%. We have adjusted our electric sales assumption, and now we anticipate flat sales growth for 2015, reflecting our year-to-date results.
We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a longer-term trend. It is important to note that in 2016, we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I customer classes in Minnesota, which should address any declining customer usage trend. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we have a pending natural gas rate case, and we are waiting for an ALJ recommendation, which we should receive shortly. The commission is expected to rule in January 2016. As a reminder, interim rates were implemented in October. In New Mexico, we refiled our electric rate case, which seeks an increase of $45.4 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of about 54% and a historical test year adjusted for known and measurable changes. A commission decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in 2016. 
Finally, in our Texas electric rate case, in mid-October, we received the ALJ recommendations, which reflected a $1 million rate increase and compares to our requested increase of $42 million. The ALJ's recommendation was based on an ROE of 9.7% and an equity ratio of almost 54%.
We reviewed the recommendations and believe there were errors in the filing, and therefore, sent a letter to notify the Texas Commission of our concerns. Late yesterday, the Texas staff revised the recommended rate increase to $14.4 million.
Please note, that due to the timing of this update, our earnings release does not reflect this revised revenue recommendation. In addition, we have not had a chance to analyze this subsequent filing.
The ALJ's recommendations are somewhat mixed. We prevailed on a number of key items, such as cost allocation issues, that if supported by the commission will establish solid precedent and should eliminate these disputes in future proceedings. Unfortunately, the ALJ's recommendation did not vary from the historic test year precedent and rejected our forward-looking adjustments, proposed test-year planned additions and the SPP cost, which represented a significant portion of our request. We believe these adjustments relate to policy decisions about the best way to alleviate regulatory lag, which needs to be addressed by the commission. While the commission isn't required to implement provisions of the recently passed legislation in this case, we remain hopeful that the commission will be more open to addressing regulatory lag, taking into consideration the intent of the legislation and making its final decision in this case. The commission is expected to rule by year-end, with the new rates effective by January 2016. 
In our earnings release today, we also announced that we will start using market share purchase to fund our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs in 2016. This will eliminate an annual equity issuance of about $75 million and reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and projected cash flows. This morning, we are narrowing our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. Previously, the range was $2 to $2.15 per share. We are also initiating our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. 
I would also like to mention that we will be hosting an Analyst Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 3. At the meeting, we plan to update you on our plans to achieve our 50-basis-point improvement and earned ROE; our regulatory plan; our plans to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan; our 5-year capital forecast, including potential incremental investment opportunities; and finally, we will update our rate base growth estimates and financing plan. 
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. We had an excellent quarter and are on track to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for 11th consecutive year. We are on track to deliver O&M consistent with our 0% to 2% objective. We initiated 2016 earnings guidance, which is in line with our 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate objective. We filed our revised resource plan in Minnesota, which is designed to reduce carbon on the NSP system by 60% by 2030. We have received all regulatory approvals for the Courtenay Wind project. We completed the commission informational meeting on the rate basing of natural gas reserves in Colorado. We've made progress on several regulatory dockets and intend to file our Minnesota multiyear rate case next week. Finally, we eliminated all equity issuances from our forecast beginning in 2016.
So operator, with that, we'll now take questions."

I doesn't mean you -- rate base growth is great. That's why we're focused on fuel-for-steal [ph]  or steal-for-fuel, [ph]  whatever -- which ever way you like it. It's basically -- the good thing about it is it doesn't impact the customers very much. So to specifically answer your question, obviously, when you look at 2030 -- or through 2030, it's going to depend upon what set of assumptions you buy into. I think we're in an environment where gas prices are going to be pretty stable. I think we're in an environment where tech -- renewables are going to continue to fall, even if they're not as supported robustly with -- at the federal level with ITC and PTC. So really, when I look at it, I think that meeting this -- exceeding the Clean Power Plan, reducing our emissions by 60% here in the upper Midwest can be done over a cumulative 15-year period, but no more than perhaps a 2% cumulative increase over that time frame. So negligible, right? And so the real issue is going to be can we build out infrastructure? Can we do these other things and not have that pace exceed customer affordability? And I think the answer to that is yes, we can. Getting into multiyear compacts is the way you do that. Cost control is the way you do that. Discipline about your capital investments is the way you do that. And we're spending a lot of time on that, and I'm very confident this plan is going to be affordable. Yes, Travis, I'll just say, all you have to do is look at some of the wind assets and other assets we're bringing on there. They're right on parity with fossil, and I think they will be, too, even with the expiration of tax credits."

So could we do more? Sure. And we're going to -- our stated goal is to grow the dividend at 5% to 7%. We have a lot of runway. But I mean, right now, that's what we're focused on: a 4% to 6% EPS growth, 5% to 7% dividend growth. If we are at the upper end of our EPS growth rate, we'll never really exceed that 60%. We'd stay -- the payout ratio today would stay about the same, which would give us more flexibility. So it's really -- I think we're kind of in a great position to have a lot of levers to reward shareholders. And one of the things everybody worries about is rising interest rates, if and when that ever happens. It's great to be able to do more with your dividend to perhaps offset that risk, and we've got that flexibility."

And I'll stick with wind, which does enjoy the production tax credit, which is worth about $22 a megawatt hour. So with that credit in mind, we're seeing wind deals that have come to us across all of our regions in the mid-20s a megawatt hour, levelized, 20 years. Now compare that, Paul, to what we could go out today and buy a strip of natural gas, future contracts for. I mean, even in this low gas-priced environment, if you took those gas reserves, took it -- times it by the applicable heat rate, I think you'd find $25 a megawatt hour for wind to be on parity, if not, in the money. So essentially, what we're doing when we're buying wind is hedging natural gas volatility. Now obviously, if you take away $22 from the equation, you're not looking at $25, you're looking at $47. It's a little bit out of the money. Of course, natural gas prices are at historic lows. And then I would say that -- and this applies to solar as well, is that they continue these technologies at large scale to become more and more efficient. And so I don't think their pricing's going to go up. I think if wind, if anything, will stay flat. But I mean, we've seen -- gosh, in just 5 years, we've seen capacity factors go from the mid-30s to now the low 50s. So they've seen steady improvements. We all know the story with solar. So I am optimistic about it."

And I'd be happy to talk to you more about it because I was just looking at that -- I used wind as an example because I think it's easy to get your arms around. Wind, today, you still have -- you still build the gas plant, right? Okay. But whether you fire up that gas plant with natural gas or you idle it and have it ready to go, but you displace that natural gas with wind is the equation I was talking to you about. It gets a little more complicated when we talk about solar. And the way I look at it, briefly, is it probably -- the capacity value that you bake into that is the difference between a combined cycle plant and a combustion turbine plant, roughly. I mean, there's -- it gets a little more complicated, and we probably can take it offline, but it's pretty exciting economics. And then, you get the ancillary costs as you get more on the system. It's one of the reasons why we're studying more and more what batteries can do for us. It's not like batteries are in the money for us today, but neither was solar 10 years ago. And so we want to be ready for when those -- when the technology moves into the value part of our sweet spot."

Today, we reported earnings of $0.84 for the quarter, which was $0.11 per share higher than last year. With 9 months of the year completed, we're very confident in our ability to hit our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance and are narrowing the range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. We're also initiating 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share.
As we've previously discussed, legislation was passed this year in Minnesota that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multiyear plans to up to 5 years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for a recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid modernization.
Earlier in September, I had the opportunity to discuss with the Minnesota Commission and other stakeholders our vision of the future for the utility industry. The vision I outlined included adding cost-effective renewables to our system; adopting new technology, like battery storage; modernizing our distribution grid, making it more resilient and ready for 2-way energy flows; becoming more consumer-centric and offering additional products, options and services that our customers want; changing our fleet to position us for the future; address the Clean Power Plan and significantly reduce carbon emissions. I also discussed the recently passed legislation that gives us a new set of tools to use as we look to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future while providing significant benefit for consumers, investors and policymakers. 
Multiyear plan provides greater certainty and transparency for both the company and our customers. It also provides a longer runway to transform our cost structure and allows us to address significant energy policy issues, which can be difficult to do when you're in a litigated rate case proceeding. Overall, I appreciated the opportunity and felt the meeting went well.
Consistent with our vision of the future, we recently filed an update to our Minnesota resource plan. The proposed plan now achieves a 60% carbon reduction for the NSP system by 2030 and includes the following key components: the retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023, Sherco Unit 1 in 2026; the addition of 800 megawatts of wind and 400 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2016 and 2020; the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and 1,000 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2020 and 2030; and finally, the addition of a 230-megawatt combustion turbine unit in North Dakota and a 780-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Sherco site in the mid-2020s. Well, this is an exciting plan that has widespread stakeholders support. It also is a continuation of our proactive environmental leadership strategy, which leaves us well positioned to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. And I believe this plan will create ownership opportunities for Xcel Energy as well. 
The recently passed legislation, our proactive resource plan filing and our plans to file a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota are all part of our strategy to streamline the regulatory process so we can focus on longer-term energy policy issues. In early November, we plan to file a rate case in Minnesota. The rate case is driven by capital investment and will incorporate key provisions of the legislation into the filing.
While we won't discuss the specifics of the request prior to the filing, I do want to provide you with the overall framework of the case. We're filing a 3-year multiyear rate plan. We're also providing an option to extend that 3-year plan to 5 years. In addition, we will be requesting interim rates for both 2016 and 2017. While the case could take over a year to complete, we are going to see if we can settle the case or offer mediation to shorten the time frame to reach a final decision. I believe the combination of a legislation, the resource plan filing, stakeholder outreach and the optionality of the multiyear plan filing put us in excellent position to achieve a constructive outcome in the Minnesota rate case. 
So now let me focus on investment opportunities. We have previously discussed our plans to step in to the development of Courtenay Wind project. During the quarter, we received approvals from both the Minnesota and the North Dakota commission. As a result, we're moving forward with the project, which will now be included in rate base versus a PPA, which was the original plan. Now this is an example of our steal-for-fuel [ph] strategy, where we take a pass-through cost and move it into rate base and cause a minimal, if no, impact to the customer bill. 
Next let me give you a quick update on our efforts to rate base natural gas reserves. In August and September, the Colorado Commission held informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. The meetings were very helpful and informative. We plan to submit a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework and incorporates feedback from the meetings. Following the commission's decision on the preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016. 
Finally, this week, SPS is filing to transfer about $100 million of transmission facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma from SPS to one of our transcos. SPS no longer provides retail electric service in Kansas and Oklahoma, so this is a good opportunity to seed one of our transcos with some assets. SPS will make various regulatory filings at both the state and federal levels, and final approval is expected to take about a year.
So you can see it's been an exciting and successful quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Teresa, who will provide more details on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the third quarter of $0.84 per share, which compares with $0.73 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.14 per share and was largely due to new rates and higher rider revenues driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. The incremental revenue also reflects the impact of favorable weather. Offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, lower AFUDC earnings, higher property taxes and higher interest expense. 
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.2%, driven primarily by lower residential use per customer, partially offset by customer growth. We continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 3.6% compared to a national rate of 5.1%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%. We have adjusted our electric sales assumption, and now we anticipate flat sales growth for 2015, reflecting our year-to-date results.
We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a longer-term trend. It is important to note that in 2016, we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I customer classes in Minnesota, which should address any declining customer usage trend. 
Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we have a pending natural gas rate case, and we are waiting for an ALJ recommendation, which we should receive shortly. The commission is expected to rule in January 2016. As a reminder, interim rates were implemented in October. In New Mexico, we refiled our electric rate case, which seeks an increase of $45.4 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of about 54% and a historical test year adjusted for known and measurable changes. A commission decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in 2016. 
Finally, in our Texas electric rate case, in mid-October, we received the ALJ recommendations, which reflected a $1 million rate increase and compares to our requested increase of $42 million. The ALJ's recommendation was based on an ROE of 9.7% and an equity ratio of almost 54%.
We reviewed the recommendations and believe there were errors in the filing, and therefore, sent a letter to notify the Texas Commission of our concerns. Late yesterday, the Texas staff revised the recommended rate increase to $14.4 million.
Please note, that due to the timing of this update, our earnings release does not reflect this revised revenue recommendation. In addition, we have not had a chance to analyze this subsequent filing.
The ALJ's recommendations are somewhat mixed. We prevailed on a number of key items, such as cost allocation issues, that if supported by the commission will establish solid precedent and should eliminate these disputes in future proceedings. Unfortunately, the ALJ's recommendation did not vary from the historic test year precedent and rejected our forward-looking adjustments, proposed test-year planned additions and the SPP cost, which represented a significant portion of our request. We believe these adjustments relate to policy decisions about the best way to alleviate regulatory lag, which needs to be addressed by the commission. While the commission isn't required to implement provisions of the recently passed legislation in this case, we remain hopeful that the commission will be more open to addressing regulatory lag, taking into consideration the intent of the legislation and making its final decision in this case. The commission is expected to rule by year-end, with the new rates effective by January 2016. 
In our earnings release today, we also announced that we will start using market share purchase to fund our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs in 2016. This will eliminate an annual equity issuance of about $75 million and reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and projected cash flows. This morning, we are narrowing our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. Previously, the range was $2 to $2.15 per share. We are also initiating our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. 
I would also like to mention that we will be hosting an Analyst Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 3. At the meeting, we plan to update you on our plans to achieve our 50 basis point improvement and earned ROE; our regulatory plan; our plans to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan; our 5-year capital forecast, including potential incremental investment opportunities; and finally, we will update our rate base growth estimates and financing plan. 
With that, I'll wrap up my comments. We had an excellent quarter and are on track to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for 11th consecutive year. We are on track to deliver O&M consistent with our 0% to 2% objective. We initiated 2016 earnings guidance, which is in line with our 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate objective. We filed our revised resource plan in Minnesota, which is designed to reduce carbon on the NSP system by 60% by 2030. We have received all regulatory approvals for the Courtenay Wind project. We completed the commission informational meeting on the rate basing of natural gas reserves in Colorado. We've made progress on several regulatory dockets and intend to file our Minnesota multiyear rate case next week. Finally, we eliminated all equity issuances from our forecast beginning in 2016.
So operator, with that, we'll now take questions."

Well, obviously, Minnesota is going to drive a lot of it. And this 5-year or 3-year, whatever we end up with, is going to be a big driver in where we are. But there's other places. Colorado, we've been over-earning, so the multiyear plans have worked for both investor and consumer alike. And then the unknown is Texas. We can continue and improve that regulatory compact, take advantage of the new legislation, continue to move the regulatory compact, combine that with the transmission riders we have. That'll push it all up in the upper end. So it's getting better. It's getting better alignment with our regulators, combining that with cost control. We don't need to issue equity, and that's great.

That's why we're focused on fuel-for-steal [ph] or steal-for-fuel, [ph] whatever -- whichever way you like it. It's basically -- the good thing about it is it doesn't impact the customers very much. So to specifically answer your question, obviously, when you look at 2030 -- or through 2030, it's going to depend upon what set of assumptions you buy into. I think we're in an environment where gas prices are going to be pretty stable. I think we're in an environment where tech -- renewables are going to continue to fall, even if they're not as supported robustly with -- at the federal level with ITC and PTC. So really, when I look at it, I think that meeting this -- exceeding the Clean Power Plan, reducing our emissions by 60% here in the upper Midwest can be done over a cumulative 15-year period, but no more than perhaps a 2% cumulative increase over that time frame. So negligible, right? And so the real issue is going to be can we build out infrastructure? Can we do these other things and not have that pace exceed customer affordability? And I think the answer to that is yes, we can. Getting into multiyear compacts is the way you do that. Cost control is the way you do that. Discipline about your capital investments is the way you do that. And we're spending a lot of time on that, and I'm very confident this plan is going to be affordable. Yes, Travis, I'll just say, all you have to do is look at some of the wind assets and other assets we're bringing on there. They're right on parity with fossil, and I think they will be, too, even with the expiration of tax credits."

And I'll stick with wind, which does enjoy the production tax credit, which is worth about $22 a megawatt hour. So with that credit in mind, we're seeing wind deals that have come to us across all of our regions in the mid-20s a megawatt hour, levelized, 20 years. Now compare that, Paul, to what we could go out today and buy a strip of natural gas, future contracts for. I mean, even in this low gas-priced environment, if you took those gas reserves, took it -- times it by the applicable heat rate, I think you'd find $25 a megawatt hour for wind to be on parity, if not, in the money. So essentially, what we're doing when we're buying wind is hedging natural gas volatility. Now obviously, if you take away $22 from the equation, you're not looking at $25, you're looking at $47. It's a little bit out of the money. Of course, natural gas prices are at historic lows. And then I would say that -- and this applies to solar as well, is that they continue these technologies at large scale to become more and more efficient. And so I don't think their pricing's going to go up. I think if wind, if anything, will stay flat. But I mean, we've seen -- gosh, in just 5 years, we've seen capacity factors go from the mid-30s to now the low 50s. So they've seen steady improvements. We all know the story with solar. So I am optimistic about it."

Wind, today, you still have -- you still build the gas plant, right? Okay. But whether you fire up that gas plant with natural gas or you idle it and have it ready to go, but you displace that natural gas with wind is the equation I was talking to you about. It gets a little more complicated when we talk about solar. And the way I look at it, briefly, is it probably -- the capacity value that you bake into that is the difference between a combined cycle plant and a combustion turbine plant, roughly. I mean, there's -- it gets a little more complicated, and we probably can take it offline, but it's pretty exciting economics. And then, you get the ancillary costs as you get more on the system. It's one of the reasons why we're studying more and more what batteries can do for us. It's not like batteries are in the money for us today, but neither was solar 10 years ago. And so we want to be ready for when those -- when the technology moves into the value part of our sweet spot."
