Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President.
Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements.
These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges and Baker Hughes' acquisition related costs taken in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In our prepared remarks today, Dave will provide a brief update on our progress related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. However, the purpose of the call today is to review our quarterly financial and operational results and our outlook for 2015. We ask that you please keep your questions focused on those matters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?"

Although market is certainly tougher out there today and I will discuss that in a minute. I do want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2014.
First, I'm very proud to say that we delivered industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. We finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion, both of which are new records for the company. Leading the improvement was North America with revenue growth of 16% and profit growth of 23%, followed by the Eastern Hemisphere with revenue and profit growth of 10% and 12%, respectively. This was also a record year for both of our divisions, where 12 of our 13 product lines set new all-time highs. 
From an operating income perspective, we achieved new full year records in our Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Battle Red product lines. I highlight this performance because you want to head into any industry downturn starting from an extremely strong financial and operating platform and that certainly is where we are performing today.
And finally, during the fourth quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes. We believe this combination will create a bellwether oilfield services company, a stronger, more diverse organization with an unsurpassed depth and breadth of services. We are excited about this transaction and the benefits that will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. Similarly, employees at all levels in both organizations are excited about creating a new industry leader and the opportunities they will have as part of a larger company. 
We've also heard from any of our customers who have expressed enthusiasm about the combination. Those who see the broader, cost-effective offerings that we will be able to provide and especially those who are looking for a compelling alternative to their current incumbents in parts of the world where individually, ourselves and Baker have only a small footprint. We are continuing to highlight for our customers the benefits this combination will deliver to them. 
We have formed an integration team, led by Mark McCollum, which includes representatives from both companies. Mark and his team have already hit the ground running to develop a day 1 strategy and an ongoing integration plan, which we believe will deliver the nearly $2 billion in annual cost synergies we discussed in our previous announcement.
Now, I'm not na√Øve how hard it is to put 2 companies together. It's hard. But you know Mark and you know his excellent track records on delivering on the commitments that he makes to you, and I am confident that we will achieve our integration goals with him in the lead.
On the regulatory front, we filed the initial Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are proceeding expediently with all the NA trust filings. We continue to expect that we will complete the transaction in the second half of 2015. We look forward to realizing the strategic and financial benefits inherent in this combination to create greater value for our combined shareholders. I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the current macro headwinds facing the industry. In fact, as we continue to analyze the potential value creation opportunities of the combination, we believe the transaction is even more compelling today than when we announced it. 
I would also like to congratulate the Baker Hughes employees for delivering on an outstanding quarter with record financial results. This is clear evidence to me of the capabilities of this organization and their continued focus on supporting their customers during this period of transition.
So all in all, 2014 was a historic year for Halliburton as we stayed focused on our returns, executed on key strategies around unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our strategies have worked, are working and we intend to stay the course.
Now let me discuss where we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Later, Christian will cover our fourth quarter results. 
Obviously commodity pricing has dropped dramatically over the last several months with oil prices now at levels not seen since early 2009. The North American rig count and activity levels held up through most of the fourth quarter, as customers executed against the remainder of their 2014 budgets. However, over the last 60 days, U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs or close to 15%. Capital expenditure budgets from our customers remain fluid, but so far on average have been reduced 25% to 30% as they adjust their spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in commodity prices. As a result, we expect activity declines for North America land to accelerate further in the first quarter, impacting all of the key liquids basins. 
What is creating even more uncertainty for the service industry is that many customers have continued to revise down their capital budgets to further capital reduction announcements. This makes it difficult to size your business in today's U.S. market in particular, because it is such a fast-moving target. So while we did not experience price weakness during the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over the past several weeks and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines. 
Now we expect pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles and therefore believe our detrimental margins should be lower. That is because our margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by our focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor input cost recovered more quickly, not in that pricing increases. This up cycle did not last long enough for us to see the kinds of net pricing that would have enabled margins to recover to historically strong levels. Therefore, less pricing erosion will be needed to eventually reduce service capacity if market weakness persists.
Based on our experience in previous downturns, we expect it will take a couple of quarters to see how the interplay of pricing declines, volume reductions and equipment efficiency deterioration plays out relative to our ability to lower labor and input cost and to right size the organization and therefore, reach equilibrium in the market. The first quarter of many severe downturn is almost always the most challenging quarter to predict because pricing concessions usually impact our results in realtime. Volume declines can be erratic as customers rig plans are uncertain and can change daily. Then there is typically a delay in realizing input cost savings from our suppliers. There's 2 reasons for this. One, discussions with vendors are dependent on them truly believing we have a reduction in ongoing activity levels before we can have the kinds of tough renegotiation that results in significant input cost reductions. Second, there's a timing issue as to the expenses that flow through inventory like sand, propen, chemicals and cement. It takes a while to see lower input pricing fully reflected in your average inventory cost because you have to work off your higher-priced inventory. 
Next, headcount adjustments don't follow directly from pricing concession, as you still need to cruise to do the work. Headcount adjustments do, however, follow volume reductions. Therefore, there is a lag in getting labor costs out as activity declines. And finally, the impact of a large rig count reduction on 24-hour operations and its inherent efficiency is hard to predict as customers slow down activity in many different ways. But eventually, these moving parts all settle out and we reached some sort of equilibrium. In this environment, we would expect to see most of our margin degradation occurring over the first couple of quarters and more margin stability in the back half of the year.
Now in this very uncertain environment, we believe Halliburton's more efficient cruise and differentiated technologies are best suited to outperform. Additionally, being aligned with the right customers, those with assets in the sweet spot of the reservoir becomes more important as we expect to see those customers continue to work through the cycle, but we have to be real about it. The North America market is going to see volatility and pain for a few quarters. However, in this scenario, I like our chances.
Now moving to international. We started to see the impact of lower commodity prices during the fourth quarter. Declining oil prices have caused our customers to reduce their budgets to defer several of their new projects particularly around offshore exploration. In 2015, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions. Middle East/Asia will likely be the most resilient followed by Latin America. And finally, Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to see the sharpest declines.
Let me talk about each individually. Middle East/Asia is expected to be the best-performing region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait are all anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia and Australia, and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. In Latin America, we currently expect to see unconventional activity levels and Argentina continue to grow along with the startup of our new Integrated Asset Management in Ecuador. However, we believe lower activity levels in Mexico and Colombia were more than offset the higher growth in these markets. Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to experience significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas be in the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In addition, Russia and Norway also are experiencing significant currency weakness. 
So when you net out the international regions, we expect to see year-on-year decline, but we believe we will outperform a spending predictions indicated in the third-party surveys that are out there today. Later, Jeff will discuss some of the specific actions we are taking to adjust our cost structure to the market conditions. I can tell you that we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will do so. 
I will say that similar to previous cycles, we will protect our market share and expect to see customers focused on our highly efficient service model. As our customers struggle with cash flows, they will be very focused on optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency and I expect that this will bode very well for Halliburton. Our management team has been through previous downturns and we intend to emerge from this cycle a much stronger company on a relative basis. 
During the fourth quarter we took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market changes, and as Jeff will cover in a few minutes, there is likely to be more in the first quarter. Now for competitive purposes, we're not going to lay out our detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. However, in the short term, we are putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance but also to ensure that we are in an optimal position to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. 
The length of any downturn is very difficult to predict, but as you know, we are in a great financial position right now with strong free cash flow. We will make adjustments as activity declines and our intention is to look beyond the cycle and continue to execute our strategic initiatives. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business over a complete business cycle. As I stated, we've been through these before and we know what to do, and we will execute on that experience. The bottom line, we have historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns and we have no reason to believe that this downturn will be any different.
Now let me turn it over to Christian to provide more details on our financial performance. Christian?"

It's been a while, but I'm glad to be back on the call and looking forward to be working with all of you again. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results and later on, let me discuss our financial outlook. 
Total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of $1.4 billion. We achieved record quarterly revenues in both of our divisions and our Middle East/Asia region set a new record for both revenue and operating income. 
From a product line perspective, we had record revenues in the fourth quarter in Production Enhancement, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Artificial Lift and Consulting and Project Management while new operating income records were set by Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Landmark. 
North America revenue was flat sequentially in line with the average quarterly rig count. Operating income was modestly higher over the same period despite the impact of seasonal fourth quarter weather and holiday downtime. 
Fourth quarter margins benefited from the continued rollout of our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives as well as efficiencies we are seeing from recent enhancements through our logistics network. 
Service pricing was stable during the fourth quarter as activity levels remain robust, but are expected to deteriorate in the coming quarters. 
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth, which resulted in a new quarterly record despite the headwinds experienced in our Europe/Africa/CIS region. Operating income came in flat compared to the third quarter. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter and operating income was up 29% over the same period. Our fourth quarter margins came in just under 21% as a result of seasonal year-end software and equipment sales as well as higher integrated project-related activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia. 
Switching to Europe/Africa/CIS, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined 8% and 35%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter as we experienced significant reduction in activity levels in the North Sea, Russia and Angola. Declining oil prices and project economics caused our customers to reduce activity levels and defer several of their new projects. Russia and Norway results were also significantly affected by currency weakness. 
In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially, while operating income declined 4% compared to the previous quarter. The revenue increase was the result of year-end software sales, increased artificial lift activity in Venezuela and higher activity levels across the majority of our product lines in Columbia. Operating income was negatively impacted during the quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints in Mexico. 
Now I'll address some additional financial items. As a result of the market decline that has primarily impacted our international business, we incurred $129 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, consisting of severance related costs as well as asset write-offs. The majority of these adjustments related to our Eastern Hemisphere business. 
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter excluding $17 million in costs related to the Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million excluding acquisition-related costs and this will be the new run rate for 2015.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27%, which was lower than expected as a result of Congress approving the federal research and experimentation tax credit in late December. As we go forward in 2015, we're expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Currently, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be essentially in line with 2014 and expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.4 billion for the year. 
I know this may surprise some a few, but let me lay out our approach. As Dave mentioned, our objective is to look beyond the cycle and continue to invest in certain strategic technology such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older, more costly equipment. As we have previously discussed, our Q10 pump support our surface efficiency strategy that will enable us to lower operators cost while at the same time, protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. As you know, we manufacture our own equipment, which gives us the utmost flexibility in this market and can adjust our spend accordingly based on our visibility. 
Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of activity decline in the coming quarters continues to be unclear, preventing us from providing specific guidance. But let me give you some thoughts around the first quarter of 2015. 
For the first quarter of 2015, our results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that you've seen in previous years. Landmark completions and direct sales activities typically falloff in the first quarter as those businesses benefit historically from customer's year-end budgets. Our business will also be impacted by weather-related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia. 
In the first quarter of 2014, this seasonality impacted our results by approximately 22%. However, this year, we believe the decline will be exacerbated by the macro headwinds currently faced by the industry. In North America, the U.S. rig count is already down 9% from the fourth quarter average and the rate of decline has accelerated in the last 2 weeks. We expect activity levels to continue to drop throughout the first quarter accompanied by price reductions. 
As Dave mentioned, for the beginning of the down cycle is typically the most challenging, but we believe that our sequential detrimentals in the first quarter will be less severe than what we have previously experienced in the prior downturn. 
We finished 2014 in a solid financial position. We continue to have the best returns in our peer group. We reduced working capital by 7 days since our Analyst Day and gave back 33% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders in 2014. In 2015, we will continue to focus on working capital and returns, and we will live within our cash flows. We will also continue to adjust our cost structure and currently anticipate that we will be incurring restructuring charges for severance and other actions that we are contemplating in the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?"
177698,278913870,747065,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although, oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it still grows. Demand is forecast",1097,"Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although, oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it still grows. Demand is forecast to increase by an estimated 900,000 barrels per day. Keep in mind the steep decline curves are still at work. We estimate the average annual production decline rates for unconventionals in North America are in excess of 30% and much higher in some areas. Depending on the ultimate trajectory of the rig count declines and the backlog of well completions, we believe that North America crude production could begin to respond during the back half of the year. 
Internationally, decline rates have become more pronounced in several key markets over the last couple of years in areas like Angola, Norway and Russia, historical growth has given way to net production declines in the last year while decline rates in markets like Mexico and India have actually accelerated. Consequently, we believe that any sustained period of underinvestment due to reduced operator spending should link to an increase in commodity prices and this largely ignores the possibility of short-term disruptions due to geopolitical issues. So the long-term fundamentals of our business are still strong, but it's clear we're heading into an activity downturn. We can look at previous cycles for insight and while history doesn't always repeat, sometimes it rhymes.
In North America, we're looking at the rig count decline relative to past downturns. After a plateau through much of the fourth quarter, the rig count has dropped jot sharply over the last 2 months and is already down 15% from early December. This trajectory is similar to both the 2001, 2002 cycle and the 2008, 2009 cycle and in those cases, we experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a 3-quarter period.
Over the past several years, we've taken key steps to reduce our underlying cost profile, step such as deploying Frac of the Future, streamlining our field operations for Battle Red and vertically integrated portions of logistics network. For these reasons, we are confident that we are better prepared than our competitors to execute through this coming cycle.
In the international markets, our projects and contracts tend to be longer-term in nature than in North America. Historically, this has resulted in reduced year-on-year volatility. However, nearly all of our customers are currently reassessing their priorities and looking for efficiencies, and even more so in the offshore space. And it's important to note that this group has been quick to react to declining commodity prices with the first news being made in mid-'14 [ph] as sub $100 oil. Although projects already underway are continuing to move forward, generally speaking, we're seeing significant reductions in new work being tendered and projects that can be delayed are moving to the right. 
As we evaluate service intensity for our international markets, we keep a close eye on revenue per rig, which helps us understand the overall health of the business. Although this metric took a step backwards during the 2009 economic downturn, we've seen consistent improvement over the last 4 years. In fact, we're in a better position now than going into the last cycle. 
Our 2014 revenue per rig is more than 20% higher than in 2008. For Halliburton, this expansion represents not only the value of technical content in complex wells, but also our ability to expand our footprint in underserved geographies as well as underutilized product lines. We believe this demonstrates the success of our growth strategies, deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals, and positions us to outperform through the next cycle. 
As Christian said, the midterm outlook is unclear but whether this cycle ends in the sharp or takes time to recover, our strategy will be consistent. First things first. We'll control the things we control. We've already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally and as activity in North America begins to fall more sharply, we will make similar adjustments here as well. Between actions already taken in the fourth quarter and actions we anticipate taken by the end of the first quarter, we expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors. 
We intend to minimize discretionary spending in our operations. As operators have requested price discussions with us, we've opened dialogues with our suppliers around both volume pricing and anticipate reducing our input cost profile. We'll continue to manufacture our Frac of the Future equipment and plan to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate the retirement of older fleets, which operate at a higher cost, especially in 24-hour operations. The value we have seen from the rollout of our Q10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations and despite the current market conditions, we feel it's the right decision for our shareholders to move forward with this initiative. Frac of the Future, not only gets the job done with 25% less capital and offers maintenance savings of up to 50%, an optimized Frac of the Future spread running under the right efficiency model can complete a well more than 50% faster than legacy equipment and it does all this with 35% fewer people on location. 
Frac of the Future represents about 30% of our North American fleet today and we expect that number to be closer to 50% by year end. Second, service quality really matters and even more so in this environment, and our ability to execute more efficiently, lowers nonproductive times for our customers and reduces their effective cost per barrel. Due to the nature of the work that we do today, large complex shale wells in North America increasingly technical offshore work and a growing base of integrated projects on the international stage, we believe that our superior execution and best-in-class technical solutions will allow us to maintain utilization and outperform our peers. 
As a management team, this isn't our first downturn. We're talking to our customers every day and it's safe to say that budget expectations are a moving target. Accordingly we've given ourselves flexibility inside of our capital budget to right-size quickly to whatever the market gives us. I'm very pleased with our management team and the strategies we have in place, and believe that we are well positioned to outperform in the downturn and to ensure that we take advantage of the recovery up cycle and come out a much stronger company.

These are the customers that are the best economics of their acreage, I was wondering if you could talk with some of the steps you think these stronger guys are taking. Are you seeing kind of high-grade drilling yet? Is it CapEx shifting amongst our product lines? Are you starting to see them use their scale to get more pricing concessions in the supply chain? Just help me understand how maybe your customer base is clearly differentiated. How are they responding differently or are they yet?"

Let's have to remain service company and operator very flexible and how we're approaching this market in terms of where we're going to put rigs up, how many rigs we're going to have there.

You want to keep your business franchise strong and as Christian indicated, we're looking at basically a flat capital budget for next year, but the reality is that a lot of that is going in to building out our Q10 pump system because frankly, you guys would shoot me if I didn't continue to invest in that technology. It's a great technology. It's a differentiating technology. It saves not only customers money but it saves us operating costs, so we'd be crazy not to push through with the deployment of that and retire the older assets. The reality is if we did, if we had pulled back there our capital expenses for next year likely would be going down, but generally, my experience has been stay flexible, stay nimble, stays strong financially and I think that when we come out of this thing especially when we execute the transaction with Baker, we're going to be a heck of a company and I'm really looking forward to that."

While the market is certainly tougher out there today, and I will discuss that in a minute, I do want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2014.
First, I'm very proud to say that we delivered industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. We finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion, both of which are new records for the company. Leading the improvement was North America with revenue growth of 16% and profit growth of 23%, followed by the Eastern Hemisphere with revenue and profit growth of 10% and 12%, respectively. 
This was also a record year for both of our divisions where 12 of our 13 product lines set new all-time highs. 
From an operating income perspective, we achieved new full year records in our Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and barite product lines. I highlight this performance because you want to head into any industry downturn starting from an extremely strong financial and operating platform and that certainly is where we are performing today.
And finally, during the fourth quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes. We believe this combination will create a bellwether oilfield services company, a stronger, more diverse organization with an unsurpassed depth and breadth of services. We are excited about this transaction and the benefits it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. Similarly, employees at all levels in both organizations are excited about creating a new industry leader and the opportunities they will have as part of a larger company. 
We've also heard from many of our customers who have expressed enthusiasm about the combination, those who see the broader, cost-effective offerings that we will be able to provide and especially those who are looking for a compelling alternative to their current incumbents in parts of the world where, individually, ourselves and Baker, have only a small footprint. We are continuing to highlight for our customers the benefits this combination will deliver to them. 
We have formed an integration team, led by Mark McCollum, which includes representatives from both companies. Mark and his team have already hit the ground running to develop a day 1 strategy and an ongoing integration plan, which we believe will deliver the nearly $2 billion in annual cost synergies we discussed in our previous announcement.
Now I'm not naive how hard it is to put 2 companies together. It's damn hard. But you know Mark and you know his excellent track record on delivering on the commitments that he makes to you and I am confident that we will achieve our integration goals with him in the lead.
On the regulatory front, we filed the initial Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are proceeding expediently with all the antitrust filings. We continue to expect that we will complete the transaction in the second half of 2015. 
We look forward to realizing the strategic and financial benefits inherent in this combination to create greater value for our combined shareholders. I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the current macro headwinds facing the industry. In fact, as we continue to analyze the potential value-creation opportunities of the combination, we believe the transaction is even more compelling today than when we announced it. 
I would also like to congratulate the Baker Hughes employees for delivering on an outstanding quarter with record financial results. This is clear evidence to me of the capabilities of this organization and their continued focus on supporting their customers during this period of transition.
So all in all, 2014 was a historic year for Halliburton as we stayed focused on our returns, executed on key strategies around unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our strategies have worked, are working and we intend to stay the course.
Now let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Later, Christian will cover our fourth quarter results. 
Obviously, commodity pricing has dropped dramatically over the last several months with oil prices now at levels not seen since early 2009. The North America rig count and activity levels held up through most of the fourth quarter as customers executed against the remainder of their 2014 budgets. 
However, over the last 60 days, U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs or close to 15%. Capital expenditure budgets from our customers remain fluid, but so far, on average, have been reduced 25% to 30% as they adjust their spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in commodity prices. As a result, we expect activity declines for North America land to accelerate further in the first quarter, impacting all of the key liquids basins. 
What is creating even more uncertainty for the service industry is that many customers have continued to revise down their capital budgets through further capital reduction announcements. This makes it difficult to size your business in today's U.S. market, in particular, because it is such a fast-moving target. 
So while we did not experience price weakness during the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over the past several weeks and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines. 
Now we expect pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles and therefore believe our decremental margins should be lower. That is because our margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by our focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor input costs recovered more quickly, not through net pricing increases. This up cycle did not last long enough for us to see the kinds of net pricing that would have enabled margins to recover to historically strong levels. Therefore, less pricing erosion will be needed to eventually reduce service capacity if market weakness persists.
Based on our experience in previous downturns, we expect it will take a couple of quarters to see how the interplay of pricing declines, volume reductions and equipment efficiency deterioration plays out relative to our ability to lower labor and input costs and to rightsize the organization and therefore reach equilibrium in the market. The first quarter of any severe downturn is almost always the most challenging quarter to predict because pricing concessions usually impact our results in real time. Volume declines can be erratic as customers' rig plans are uncertain and can change daily. Then there is typically a delay in realizing input cost savings from our suppliers. There's 2 reasons for this: one, discussions with vendors are dependent on them truly believing we have a reduction in ongoing activity levels before we can have the kinds of tough renegotiation that results in significant input cost reductions; second, there's a timing issue as to the expenses that flow through inventory like sand, proppant, chemicals and cement. It takes a while to see lower input pricing fully reflected in your average inventory cost because you have to work off your higher-priced inventory.  
Next, headcount adjustments don't follow directly from pricing concession as you still need the crews to do the work. Headcount adjustments do, however, follow volume reductions. Therefore, there is a lag in getting labor costs out as activity declines. 
And finally, the impact of a large rig count reduction on 24-hour operations and its inherent efficiency is hard to predict as customers slow down activity in many different ways. But eventually, these moving parts all settle out and we reach some sort of equilibrium. In this environment, we would expect to see most of our margin degradation occurring over the first couple of quarters and more margin stability in the back half of the year.
Now in this very uncertain environment, we believe Halliburton's more efficient crews and differentiated technologies are best suited to outperform. Additionally, being aligned with the right customers, those with assets in the sweet spot of their reservoir, becomes more important as we expect to see those customers continue to work through the cycle. But we have to be real about it. The North America market is going to see volatility and pain for a few quarters. However, in this scenario, I like our chances.
Now moving to international. We started to see the impact of lower commodity prices during the fourth quarter. Declining oil prices have caused our customers to reduce their budgets and defer several of their new projects, particularly around offshore exploration. In 2015, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions. Middle East/Asia will likely be the most resilient followed by Latin America. And finally, Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to see the sharpest declines.
Let me talk about each individually. Middle East/Asia is expected to be the best-performing region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait are all anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia and Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. 
In Latin America, we currently expect to see unconventional activity levels in Argentina continue to grow, along with the start-up of our new Integrated Asset Management project in Ecuador. However, we believe lower activity levels in Mexico and Colombia will more than offset the higher growth in these markets. 
Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to experience significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In addition, Russia and Norway also experience significant currency weakness. 
So when you net out the international regions, we expect to see year-on-year decline, but we believe we will outperform spending predictions indicated in the third-party surveys that are out there today. 
Later, Jeff will discuss some of the specific actions we are taking to adjust our cost structure to the market conditions. I can tell you that we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will do so. 
I will say that, similar to previous cycles, we will protect our market share and expect to see customers focused on our highly efficient service model. As our customers struggle with cash flows, they will be very focused on optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency and I expect that this will bode very well for Halliburton. 
Our management team has been through previous downturns and we intend to emerge from this cycle a much stronger company on a relative basis. 
During the fourth quarter we took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market changes, and as Jeff will cover in a few minutes, there is likely to be more in the first quarter. 
Now for competitive purposes, we're not going to lay out our detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. However, in the short term, we are putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance, but also to ensure that we are in an optimal position to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. 
The length of any downturn is very difficult to predict, but as you know, we are in a great financial position right now with strong free cash flow. We will make adjustments as activity declines and our intention is to look beyond the cycle and continue to execute our strategic initiatives. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business over a complete business cycle. As I stated, we've been through these before and we know what to do and we will execute on that experience. The bottom line: we have historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns and we have no reason to believe that this downturn will be any different.
Now let me turn it over to Christian to provide more details on our financial performance. Christian?"

It's been awhile, but I'm glad to be back on the call and looking forward to be working with all of you again. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, and later on, let me discuss our financial outlook. 
Total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of $1.4 billion. We achieved record quarterly revenues in both our divisions, and our Middle East/Asia region set a new record for both revenue and operating income. 
From a product line perspective, we had record revenues in the fourth quarter in Production Enhancement, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Artificial Lift and Consulting and Project Management while new operating income records were set by Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Landmark. 
North America revenue was flat sequentially, in line with the average quarterly rig count. Operating income was modestly higher over the same period despite the impact of seasonal fourth quarter, weather and holiday downtime. Fourth quarter margins benefited from the continued rollout of our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives as well as efficiencies we are seeing from recent enhancements to our logistics network. 
Service pricing was stable during the fourth quarter as activity levels remained robust, but are expected to deteriorate in the coming quarters. 
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth, which resulted in a new quarterly record despite the headwinds experienced in our Europe/Africa/CIS region. Operating income came in flat compared to the third quarter. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter and operating income was up 29% over the same period. Our fourth quarter margins came in just under 21% as a result of seasonal year-end software and equipment sales as well as higher integrated project-related activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia. 
Switching to Europe/Africa/CIS, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined 8% and 35%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter as we experienced significant reduction in activity levels in the North Sea, Russia and Angola. Declining oil prices and project economics caused our customers to reduce activity levels and defer several of their new projects. Russia and Norway results were also significantly affected by currency weakness. 
In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially, while operating income declined 4% compared to the previous quarter. The revenue increase was the result of year-end software sales, increased artificial lift activity in Venezuela and higher activity levels across the majority of our product lines in Colombia. Operating income was negatively impacted during the quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints in Mexico. 
Now I'll address some additional financial items. As a result of the market decline that has primarily impacted our international business, we incurred $129 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, consisting of severance-related costs as well as asset write-offs. The majority of these adjustments related to our Eastern Hemisphere business. 
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter excluding $17 million in costs related to the Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million, excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2015.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27%, which was lower than expected as a result of Congress approving the federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit in late December. As we go forward in 2015, we're expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. 
Currently, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be essentially in line with 2014 and expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.4 billion for the year. 
I know this may surprise some a few, but let me lay out our approach. As Dave mentioned, our objective is to look beyond the cycle and continue to invest in certain strategic technology such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older, more costly equipment. As we have previously discussed, our Q10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy that will enable us to lower operators' costs while, at the same time, protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. As you know, we manufacture our own equipment, which gives us the utmost flexibility in this market and can adjust our spend accordingly based on our visibility. 
Turning to our operational outlook. The severity of activity decline in the coming quarters continues to be unclear, preventing us from providing specific guidance. But let me give you some thoughts around the first quarter of 2015. 
For the first quarter of 2015, our results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that we've seen in previous years. Landmark, completions and direct sales activities typically fall off in the first quarter as those businesses benefit historically from customer's year-end budgets. 
Our business will also be impacted by weather-related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia. In the first quarter of 2014, this seasonality impacted our results by approximately 22%. However, this year, we believe the decline will be exacerbated by the macro headwinds currently faced by the industry. 
In North America, the U.S. rig count is already down 9% from the fourth quarter average and the rate of decline has accelerated in the last 2 weeks. We expect to see activity levels to continue to drop throughout the first quarter accompanied by price reductions. 
As Dave mentioned, the beginning of a down cycle is typically the most challenging, but we believe that our sequential decrementals in the first quarter will be less severe than what we have previously experienced in the prior downturn. 
We finished 2014 in a solid financial position. We continue to have the best returns in our peer group. We reduced working capital by 7 days since our Analyst Day and gave back 33% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders in 2014. In 2015, we will continue to focus on working capital returns and we will live within our cash flows. We will also continue to adjust our cost structure and currently anticipate that we will be incurring restructuring charges for severance and other actions that we are contemplating in the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?"
177698,278913870,747132,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it still grows. Demand is forecast",1096,"Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it still grows. Demand is forecast to increase by an estimated 900,000 barrels per day. Keep in mind that steep decline curves are still at work. We estimate the average annual production decline rates for unconventionals in North America are in excess of 30% and much higher in some areas. Depending on the ultimate trajectory of the rig count declines and the backlog of well completions, we believe that North America crude production could begin to respond during the back half of the year. 
Internationally, decline rates have become more pronounced in several key markets over the last couple of years. In areas like Angola, Norway and Russia, historical growth has given way to net production declines in the last year, while decline rates in markets like Mexico and India have actually accelerated. Consequently, we believe that any sustained period of underinvestment due to reduced operator spending should lead to an increase in commodity prices and this largely ignores the possibility of short-term disruptions due to geopolitical issues. So the long-term fundamentals of our business are still strong, but it's clear we're heading into an activity downturn. We can look at previous cycles for insight, and while history doesn't always repeat, sometimes it rhymes.
In North America, we're looking at the rig count decline relative to past downturns. After a plateau through much of the fourth quarter, the rig count has dropped sharply over the last 2 months and is already down 15% from early December. This trajectory is similar to both the 2001-2002 cycle and the 2008-2009 cycle, and in those cases, we experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a 3-quarter period.
Over the past several years, we've taken key steps to reduce our underlying cost profile, steps such as deploying Frac of the Future equipment, streamlining our field operations through Battle Red and vertically integrating portions of logistics network. For these reasons, we are confident that we are better prepared than our competitors to execute through this coming cycle.
In the international markets, our projects and contracts tend to be longer term in nature than in North America. Historically, this has resulted in reduced year-on-year volatility. However, nearly all of our customers are currently reassessing their priorities and looking for efficiencies and even more so in the offshore space. And it's important to note that this group has been quick to react to declining commodity prices with the first moves being made in mid-'14 at sub-$100 oil. Although projects already underway are continuing to move forward, generally speaking, we're seeing significant reductions in new work being tendered and projects that can be delayed are moving to the right. 
As we evaluate service intensity for our international markets, we keep a close eye on revenue per rig, which helps us understand the overall health of the business. Although this metric took a step backwards during the 2009 economic downturn, we've seen consistent improvement over the last 4 years. In fact, we're in a better position now than going into the last cycle. Our 2014 revenue per rig is more than 20% higher than in 2008. For Halliburton, this expansion represents not only the value of technical content in complex wells, but also our ability to expand our footprint in underserved geographies as well as in underutilized product lines. We believe this demonstrates the success of our growth strategies, deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals, and positions us to outperform through the next cycle. 
As Christian said, the midterm outlook is unclear. But whether this cycle ends in a sharp V or takes time to recover, our strategy will be consistent. First things first. We'll control the things we control. We've already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally, and as activity in North America begins to fall more sharply, we will make similar adjustments here as well. Between actions already taken in the fourth quarter and actions we anticipate taking by the end of the first quarter, we expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors. 
We intend to minimize discretionary spending in our operations. As operators have requested price discussions with us, we've opened dialogues with our suppliers around both volume pricing and anticipate reducing our input cost profile. 
We'll continue to manufacture our Frac of the Future equipment and plan to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate the retirement of older fleets, which operate at a higher costs, especially in 24-hour operations. The value we have seen from the rollout of our Q10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations, and despite the current market conditions, we feel it's the right decision for our shareholders to move forward with this initiative. Frac of the Future not only gets the job done with 25% less capital and offers maintenance savings of up to 50%, an optimized Frac of the Future spread running under the right efficiency model can complete a well more than 50% faster than legacy equipment and it does all this with 35% fewer people on location. Frac of the Future represents about 30% of our North American fleet today and we expect that number to be closer to 50% by year end. 
Second, service quality really matters and even more so in this environment. And our ability to execute more efficiently, lowers nonproductive times for our customers and reduces their effective cost per barrel. Due to the nature of the work that we do today, large complex shale wells in North America, increasingly technical offshore work and a growing base of integrated projects on the international stage, we believe that our superior execution and best-in-class technical solutions will allow us to maintain utilization and outperform our peers. 
As a management team, this isn't our first downturn. We're talking to our customers every day and it's safe to say that budget expectations are a moving target. Accordingly we've given ourselves flexibility inside of our capital budget to rightsize quickly to whatever the market gives us. I'm very pleased with our management team and the strategies we have in place and believe that we are well positioned to outperform in the downturn and to ensure that we take advantage of the recovery up cycle and come out a much stronger company.

Whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We have demonstrated this to you for the past several years. Whatever the level of industry activity, we expect to get more than our share of it.

Clearly, there's going to be macro headwinds that would push that at the higher decline rate. If that is the case, then we will basically see a steeper decline in the operating income. As an example, last year, we saw a 300 basis points decline from Q4 to Q1 for our international markets and we expect to see a little bit higher than that this time around.

I know on my experience that you have to invest through these things. You want to keep your business franchise strong, and as Christian indicated, we're looking at basically a flat capital budget for next year. But the reality is, is that a lot of that is going into building out our Q10 pump system because, frankly, you guys would shoot me if I didn't continue to invest in that technology. It's a great technology. It's a differentiating technology. It saves not only customers' money, but it saves us operating costs. So we'd be crazy not to push through with the deployment of that and retire the older assets. The reality is if we did -- if we had pulled back there, our capital expenses for next year likely would be going down.

While the market is certainly tougher out there today, and I will discuss that in a minute, I do want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2014.
First, I'm very proud to say that we delivered industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. We finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion, both of which are new records for the company. Leading the improvement was North America with revenue growth of 16% and profit growth of 23%, followed by the Eastern Hemisphere with revenue and profit growth of 10% and 12%, respectively. 
This was also a record year for both of our divisions where 12 of our 13 product lines set new all-time highs. 
From an operating income perspective, we achieved new full year records in our Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and barite product lines. I highlight this performance because you want to head into any industry downturn starting from an extremely strong financial and operating platform and that certainly is where we are performing today.
And finally, during the fourth quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes. We believe this combination will create a bellwether oilfield services company, a stronger, more diverse organization with an unsurpassed depth and breadth of services. We are excited about this transaction and the benefits it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. Similarly, employees at all levels in both organizations are excited about creating a new industry leader and the opportunities they will have as part of a larger company. 
We've also heard from many of our customers who have expressed enthusiasm about the combination, those who see the broader, cost-effective offerings that we will be able to provide and especially those who are looking for a compelling alternative to their current incumbents in parts of the world where, individually, ourselves and Baker, have only a small footprint. We are continuing to highlight for our customers the benefits this combination will deliver to them. 
We have formed an integration team, led by Mark McCollum, which includes representatives from both companies. Mark and his team have already hit the ground running to develop a day-one strategy and an ongoing integration plan, which we believe will deliver the nearly $2 billion in annual cost synergies we discussed in our previous announcement.
Now I'm not naive how hard it is to put 2 companies together. It's damn hard. But you know Mark and you know his excellent track record on delivering on the commitments that he makes to you, and I am confident that we will achieve our integration goals with him in the lead.
On the regulatory front, we filed the initial Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are proceeding expediently with all the antitrust filings. We continue to expect that we will complete the transaction in the second half of 2015. 
We look forward to realizing the strategic and financial benefits inherent in this combination to create greater value for our combined shareholders. I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the current macro headwinds facing the industry. In fact, as we continue to analyze the potential value-creation opportunities of the combination, we believe the transaction is even more compelling today than when we announced it. 
I would also like to congratulate the Baker Hughes employees for delivering on an outstanding quarter with record financial results. This is clear evidence to me of the capabilities of this organization and their continued focus on supporting their customers during this period of transition.
So all in all, 2014 was a historic year for Halliburton as we stayed focused on our returns, executed on key strategies around unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our strategies have worked, are working and we intend to stay the course.
Now let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Later, Christian will cover our fourth quarter results. 
Obviously, commodity pricing has dropped dramatically over the last several months with oil prices now at levels not seen since early 2009. The North America rig count and activity levels held up through most of the fourth quarter as customers executed against the remainder of their 2014 budgets. 
However, over the last 60 days, U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs or close to 15%. Capital expenditure budgets from our customers remain fluid, but so far, on average, have been reduced 25% to 30% as they adjust their spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in commodity prices. As a result, we expect activity declines for North America land to accelerate further in the first quarter, impacting all of the key liquids basins. 
What is creating even more uncertainty for the service industry is that many customers have continued to revise down their capital budgets through further capital reduction announcements. This makes it difficult to size your business in today's U.S. market, in particular, because it is such a fast-moving target. 
So while we did not experience price weakness during the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over the past several weeks, and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines. 
Now we expect pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles and therefore believe our decremental margins should be lower. That is because our margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by our focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor and input costs recovered more quickly, not through net pricing increases. This up cycle did not last long enough for us to see the kinds of net pricing that would have enabled margins to recover to historically strong levels. Therefore, less pricing erosion will be needed to eventually reduce service capacity if market weakness persists.
Based on our experience in previous downturns, we expect it will take a couple of quarters to see how the interplay of pricing declines, volume reductions and equipment efficiency deterioration plays out relative to our ability to lower labor and input costs and to rightsize the organization and therefore reach an equilibrium in the market. The first quarter of any severe downturn is almost always the most challenging quarter to predict because pricing concessions usually impact our results in real time. Volume declines can be erratic as customers' rig plans are uncertain and can change daily. Then there is typically a delay in realizing input cost savings from our suppliers. There's 2 reasons for this: one, discussions with vendors are dependent on them truly believing we have a reduction in ongoing activity levels before we can have the kinds of tough renegotiation that results in significant input cost reductions; second, there's a timing issue as to the expenses that flow through inventory like sand, proppant, chemicals and cement. It takes a while to see lower input pricing fully reflected in your average inventory cost because you have to work off your higher-priced inventory.  
Next, headcount adjustments don't follow directly from pricing concession as you still need the crews to do the work. Headcount adjustments do, however, follow volume reductions. Therefore, there is a lag in getting labor costs out as activity declines. 
And finally, the impact of a large rig count reduction on 24-hour operations and its inherent efficiency is hard to predict as customers slow down activity in many different ways. But eventually, these moving parts all settle out and we reach some sort of equilibrium. In this environment, we would expect to see most of our margin degradation occurring over the first couple of quarters and more margin stability in the back half of the year.
Now in this very uncertain environment, we believe Halliburton's more efficient crews and differentiated technologies are best suited to outperform. Additionally, being aligned with the right customers, those with assets in the sweet spot of the reservoir, becomes more important as we expect to see those customers continue to work through the cycle. But we have to be real about it. The North America market is going to see volatility and pain for a few quarters. However, in this scenario, I like our chances.
Now moving to international. We started to see the impact of lower commodity prices during the fourth quarter. Declining oil prices have caused our customers to reduce their budgets and defer several of their new projects, particularly around offshore exploration. In 2015, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions. Middle East/Asia will likely be the most resilient, followed by Latin America. And finally, Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to see the sharpest declines.
Let me talk about each individually. Middle East/Asia is expected to be the best-performing region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait are all anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia and Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. 
In Latin America, we currently expect to see unconventional activity levels in Argentina continue to grow, along with the start-up of our new Integrated Asset Management project in Ecuador. However, we believe lower activity levels in Mexico and Colombia will more than offset the higher growth in these markets. 
Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to experience significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In addition, Russia and Norway also are experiencing significant currency weakness. 
So when you net out the international regions, we expect to see year-on-year decline, but we believe we will outperform spending predictions indicated in the third-party surveys that are out there today. 
Later, Jeff will discuss some of the specific actions we are taking to adjust our cost structure to the market conditions. I can tell you that we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will do so. 
I will say that, similar to previous cycles, we will protect our market share and expect to see customers focused on our highly efficient service model. As our customers struggle with cash flows, they will be very focused on optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency and I expect that this will bode very well for Halliburton. 
Our management team has been through previous downturns and we intend to emerge from this cycle a much stronger company on a relative basis. 
During the fourth quarter we took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market changes, and as Jeff will cover in a few minutes, there is likely to be more in the first quarter. 
Now for competitive purposes, we're not going to lay out our detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. However, in the short term, we are putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance, but also to ensure that we are in an optimal position to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. 
The length of any downturn is very difficult to predict, but as you know, we are in a great financial position right now with strong free cash flow. We will make adjustments as activity declines and our intention is to look beyond the cycle and continue to execute our strategic initiatives. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business over a complete business cycle. As I stated, we've been through these cycles before and we know what to do and we will execute on that experience. The bottom line: we have historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns and we have no reason to believe that this downturn will be any different.
Now let me turn it over to Christian to provide more details on our financial performance. Christian?"

It's been awhile, but I'm glad to be back on the call and looking forward to be working with all of you again. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, and later on, let me discuss our financial outlook. 
Total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of $1.4 billion. We achieved record quarterly revenues in both our divisions, and our Middle East/Asia region set a new record for both revenue and operating income. 
From a product line perspective, we had record revenues in the fourth quarter in Production Enhancement, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Artificial Lift and Consulting and Project Management while new operating income records were set by Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Landmark. 
North America revenue was flat sequentially, in line with the average quarterly rig count. Operating income was modestly higher over the same period despite the impact of seasonal fourth quarter weather and holiday downtime. Fourth quarter margins benefited from the continued rollout of our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives as well as efficiencies we are seeing from recent enhancements to our logistics network. 
Service pricing was stable during the fourth quarter as activity levels remained robust, but are expected to deteriorate in the coming quarters. 
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth, which resulted in a new quarterly record despite the headwinds experienced in our Europe/Africa/CIS region. Operating income came in flat compared to the third quarter. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter and operating income was up 29% over the same period. Our fourth quarter margins came in just under 21% as a result of seasonal year-end software and equipment sales as well as higher integrated project-related activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia. 
Switching to Europe/Africa/CIS, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined 8% and 35%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter, as we experienced significant reduction in activity levels in the North Sea, Russia and Angola. Declining oil prices and project economics caused our customers to reduce activity levels and defer several of their new projects. Russia and Norway results were also significantly affected by currency weakness. 
In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially, while operating income declined 4% compared to the previous quarter. The revenue increase was the result of year-end software sales, increased artificial lift activity in Venezuela and higher activity levels across the majority of our product lines in Colombia. Operating income was negatively impacted during the quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints in Mexico. 
Now I'll address some additional financial items. As a result of the market decline that has primarily impacted our international business, we incurred $129 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, consisting of severance-related costs as well as asset write-offs. The majority of these adjustments related to our Eastern Hemisphere business. 
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter excluding $17 million in costs related to the Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million, excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2015.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27%, which was lower than expected as a result of Congress approving the federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit in late December. As we go forward in 2015, we're expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. 
Currently, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be essentially in line with 2014 and expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.4 billion for the year. 
I know this may surprise some of you, but let me lay out our approach. As Dave mentioned, our objective is to look beyond the cycle and continue to invest in certain strategic technology such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older, more costly equipment. As we have previously discussed, our Q10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy that will enable us to lower operators' costs while, at the same time, protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. As you know, we manufacture our own equipment, which gives us the utmost flexibility in this market and can adjust our spend accordingly based on our visibility. 
Turning to our operational outlook. The severity of activity decline in the coming quarters continues to be unclear, preventing us from providing specific guidance. But let me give you some thoughts around the first quarter of 2015. 
For the first quarter of 2015, our results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that we've seen in previous years. Landmark, completions and direct sales activities typically fall off in the first quarter as those businesses benefit historically from customer's year-end budgets. 
Our business will also be impacted by weather-related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia. In the first quarter of 2014, this seasonality impacted our results by approximately 22%. However, this year, we believe the decline will be exacerbated by the macro headwinds currently faced by the industry. 
In North America, the U.S. rig count is already down 9% from the fourth quarter average, and the rate of decline has accelerated in the last 2 weeks. We expect to see activity levels continue to drop throughout the first quarter accompanied by price reductions. 
As Dave mentioned, the beginning of a down cycle is typically the most challenging, but we believe that our sequential decrementals in the first quarter will be less severe than what we have previously experienced in the prior downturn. 
We finished 2014 in a solid financial position. We continue to have the best returns in our peer group. We reduced working capital by 7 days since our Analyst Day and gave back 33% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders in 2014. In 2015, we will continue to focus on working capital returns and we will live within our cash flows. We will also continue to adjust our cost structure and currently anticipate that we will be incurring restructuring charges for severance and other actions that we are contemplating in the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?"

Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it's still growth. Demand is foreca",1096,"Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it's still growth. Demand is forecast to increase by an estimated 900,000 barrels per day. Keep in mind that steep decline curves are still at work. We estimate the average annual production decline rates for unconventionals in North America are in excess of 30% and much higher in some areas. Depending on the ultimate trajectory of the rig count declines and the backlog of well completions, we believe that North America crude production could begin to respond during the back half of the year. 
Internationally, decline rates have become more pronounced in several key markets over the last couple of years. In areas like Angola, Norway and Russia, historical growth has given way to net production declines in the last year, while decline rates in markets like Mexico and India have actually accelerated. Consequently, we believe that any sustained period of underinvestment due to reduced operator spending should lead to an increase in commodity prices and this largely ignores the possibility of short-term disruptions due to geopolitical issues. So the long-term fundamentals of our business are still strong, but it's clear we're heading into an activity downturn. We can look at previous cycles for insight, and while history doesn't always repeat, sometimes it rhymes.
In North America, we're looking at the rig count decline relative to past downturns. After a plateau through much of the fourth quarter, the rig count has dropped sharply over the last 2 months and is already down 15% from early December. This trajectory is similar to both the 2001-2002 cycle and the 2008-2009 cycle, and in those cases, we experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a 3-quarter period.
Over the past several years, we've taken key steps to reduce our underlying cost profile, steps such as deploying Frac of the Future equipment, streamlining our field operations through Battle Red and vertically integrating portions of logistics network. For these reasons, we are confident that we are better prepared than our competitors to execute through this coming cycle.
In the international markets, our projects and contracts tend to be longer term in nature than in North America. Historically, this has resulted in reduced year-on-year volatility. However, nearly all of our customers are currently reassessing their priorities and looking for efficiencies and even more so in the offshore space. And it's important to note that this group has been quick to react to declining commodity prices with the first moves being made in mid-'14 at sub-$100 oil. Although projects already underway are continuing to move forward, generally speaking, we're seeing significant reductions in new work being tendered, and projects that can be delayed are moving to the right. 
As we evaluate service intensity for our international markets, we keep a close eye on revenue per rig, which helps us understand the overall health of the business. Although this metric took a step backwards during the 2009 economic downturn, we've seen consistent improvement over the last 4 years. In fact, we're in a better position now than going into the last cycle. Our 2014 revenue per rig is more than 20% higher than in 2008. For Halliburton, this expansion represents not only the value of technical content in complex wells, but also our ability to expand our footprint in underserved geographies as well as in underutilized product lines. We believe this demonstrates the success of our growth strategies, deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals, and positions us to outperform through the next cycle. 
As Christian said, the midterm outlook is unclear. But whether this cycle ends in a sharp V or takes time to recover, our strategy will be consistent. First things first. We'll control the things we control. We've already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally, and as activity in North America begins to fall more sharply, we will make similar adjustments here as well. Between actions already taken in the fourth quarter and actions we anticipate taking by the end of the first quarter, we expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors. 
We intend to minimize discretionary spending in our operations. As operators have requested price discussions with us, we've opened dialogues with our suppliers around both volume pricing and anticipate reducing our input cost profile. 
We'll continue to manufacture our Frac of the Future equipment and plan to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate the retirement of older fleets, which operate at a higher cost, especially in 24-hour operations. The value we have seen from the rollout of our Q10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations, and despite the current market conditions, we feel it's the right decision for our shareholders to move forward with this initiative. Frac of the Future not only gets the job done with 25% less capital and offers maintenance savings of up to 50%, an optimized Frac of the Future spread running under the right efficiency model can complete a well more than 50% faster than legacy equipment and it does all this with 35% fewer people on location. Frac of the Future represents about 30% of our North American fleet today and we expect that number to be closer to 50% by year end. 
Second, service quality really matters and even more so in this environment. And our ability to execute more efficiently lowers nonproductive times for our customers and reduces their effective cost per barrel. Due to the nature of the work that we do today, large complex shale wells in North America, increasingly technical offshore work and a growing base of integrated projects on the international stage, we believe that our superior execution and best-in-class technical solutions will allow us to maintain utilization and outperform our peers. 
As a management team, this isn't our first downturn. We're talking to our customers every day and it's safe to say that budget expectations are a moving target. Accordingly we've given ourselves flexibility inside of our capital budget to rightsize quickly to whatever the market gives us. I'm very pleased with our management team and the strategies we have in place and believe that we are well positioned to outperform in the downturn and to ensure that we take advantage of the recovery up cycle and come out a much stronger company.

But the reality is, is that a lot of that is going into building out our Q10 pump system because, frankly, you guys would shoot me if I didn't continue to invest in that technology. It's a great technology. It's a differentiating technology. It saves not only customers' money, but it saves us operating costs. So we'd be crazy not to push through with the deployment of that and retire the older assets. The reality is if we did -- if we had pulled back there, our capital expenses for next year likely would be going down.

That said, we are working with our customers around efficiency approaches, how can we lower total cost of operations for them and this really gets back to our basic strategy, which is around reducing uncertainty and increasing reliability in operations. And we've made terrific gains in nonproductive time over the last couple of years and that's a differentiator for us."

177698,283133477,790429,"Halliburton Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2015",2015-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry, which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodit",1988,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry, which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodity prices. 
For Halliburton, total company revenue of $7.1 billion was a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 relative to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count, once again, representing industry-leading revenue performance. Operating income declined 28% year-over-year to approximately $700 million, driven by North America and Europe/Africa/CIS. The industry experienced unprecedented decline in the North America drilling activity during the first quarter, which significantly impacted our financial results. 
U.S. rig count has dropped approximately 50% from the peak in late November and we're still seeing activity falloff week to week, although the pace of decline has slowed. Looking back over the last several major cycles, the speed of this downturn has been historically high. Because of the lack of available work, driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity and available equipment, chasing the work that remains, this is an extremely competitive market. We're seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and a significant amount of service capacity is looking for work. 
Service company behavior has fallen in really into 1 in 3 buckets. First, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors; second, those who've decided that cover and fixed cost is no longer important and therefore, will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss; and third, those that are basically working at a price, which covers only their cash costs. Now ultimately, neither model 2 or 3 is sustainable and we believe capacity adjustments are likely in a market like this. 
We're not going to call the bottom. But historically, it's taken rig count 3 quarters to move from peak to trough. Once we see activity stabilize, the healing process can begin, but it takes time. Our input cost can then start to catch up with service pricing declines and our efficiency programs and well solutions can start driving margins upwards. Now what is not unique about this downturn is that customer, service company and supplier behavior is pretty much as you would expect. What is unique is the speed at which this is happening. We believe that the operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners and so will the vendors who work with us to get through it.
Outside of North America, the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market, but were not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. The international rig count is down 9% from the peak last July and we're seeing customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets due to the lower cash flows available to operators, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs and are asking oil service companies, engineering companies and fabricators to offer solutions, including pricing concessions. We're working with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. 
As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions this year with full year international spending reflecting a midteens reduction. We still expect Middle East/Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is experiencing significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In particular, the offshore markets are facing extremely challenging economics. We've already seen significant delays in exploration work in these markets with a number of pending opportunities still at risk as operators work to balance their budgets. And in Latin America, we expect lower activity levels across the region with the largest declines projected in Mexico as a result of budget constraints and Colombia, where operators exercising their programs to live within cash flows. 
In addition, we anticipate lower revenue resulting from the new Venezuelan exchange rate. Now given the near-term headwinds that we're seeing globally, our focus is on controlling what's within our control. First, after taking a hard look at our global operations in the first quarter, we streamlined our business primarily through headcount and asset reductions while not impacting our service delivery model, which resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge, including a complete write-off of our operations in both Libya and Yemen. Christian will provide more details later in the call.
Second, we're continuing to work with our suppliers. As we discussed last quarter, there is a delay in realizing cost savings from our suppliers. Input cost reductions around items like stand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year. We are pleased that many of our key vendors now realize the type of market that we are in and they're working with us to allow us to get our input costs more competitive. We're also looking at consolidating our vendor lists into fewer companies that we can commit more volume to going forward.
Third, we are staying focused on service execution and collaborating with our customers to reduce their well costs. Fourth, we are playing offense. We are focused on the utilization of our deployed assets and we are defending our market share with key customers. And finally and most importantly, we are still a returns-driven organization and where pricing concessions would've pushed returns below an acceptable threshold, we have instead elected to stack equipment, including frac lease. Given the unsustainable prices we've seen some of our competition willing to work for, we would rather save our equipment for better times. 
One other thing I need to point out is that in a typical downturn, we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done, but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year, we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform. We know we have best-in-class service delivery and keeping this platform in peak condition will allow us to realize our transaction synergies post-close. This means that we are not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise. And consequently, we are carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins, it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.
As we've done in previous downturns, we are looking through the cycle and investing capital strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to position ourselves to be able to accelerate out of the downturn when the market recovers. This includes investing in key technologies and capabilities that allow us to deliver our value proposition in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. As I mentioned previously, we are always working closely with customers around the world to help them lower their cost per barrel of oil equivalent. We approach this in 2 ways. 
First, through more efficient, more reliable lower-cost delivery platform; and second, through technology that reduces uncertainty and makes better wells. In terms of efficiency, this is where innovations like our Frac of the Future with its increased reliability and lower cost profile become important differentiators. Our Q10 pump supports our surface efficiencies strategy, which will enable us to lower operators costs while at the same time, protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. This is also where we leverage the scale of our global logistics network and supply chain. 
Now just as important, we're working with our customers to help them make better wells through subsurface insight and custom chemistry. Our CoreVault system is a great example of delivering subsurface insight where we're able to collect multiple core samples during a single trip and preserve 100% of the downhole fluid for analysis. This accelerates our customers reservoir understanding, more precisely locates hydrocarbons and helps them fully understand the economic value of your asset. We're doing this today in every North American basin and have recently expanded into Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Our CYPHER, Seismic-to-Stimulation services gaining traction, helping more customers maximize the value of their unconventional assets. Our CYPHER project account actually increased sequentially even as activity levels declined. The added projects included both existing customers expanding their programs as well as customers new to the CYPHER platform. And finally, custom chemistry, where we are pleased with the expansion of AccessFrac, which helps our customers efficiently and effectively stimulate the entire lateral. In addition to being used and 12 basins around the world, AccessFrac is also seeing significant uptake as a re-frac solution in North America. When deploying our proprietary chemical diversion technology into early unconventional oil wells, we've seen instances where the estimated ultimate recovery has more than doubled. 
There's been a lot of discussion around inventory wells. Operators choosing to drill, but not complete wells and then defer production until commodity prices become more favorable. Third-party estimates put this number around 4,000 wells. As our view, that although inventory wells can exacerbate the short-term activity declines for completions, it essentially defers the revenue opportunity. When our customers decide to increase activity levels, this will be beneficial for Halliburton as they're likely to increase completions and tandem with new well drilling, which could accelerate our rate of recovery during the up cycle. Now before I turn the call over to Christian, I want to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. 
Over the past several months, global demand expectations for 2015 have been consistently revised higher. Not calling for an increase of over 1 million barrels per day including recent upward revisions for both U.S. and Europe. On the supply side, we're all watching U.S. production levels very closely given the volume expansions that took place throughout 2013 and 2014. Recently, monthly production estimates have been encouraging, however, showing significantly lower production growth and actually projecting oil production to be flat to down in the major basins. 
In terms of international production, non-OPEC estimates continue to be trimmed and we see this as an overlooked positive factor. Comparing the IEA forecast exit rate for 2015 against 2014, key non-OPEC contributors are expected to decline with further reduction expected as a result of the declining global rig count, we knew this is ultimately constructive for the prospect of supply demand equilibrium. Whether we reach this point in months or quarters, Halliburton will continue to take the necessary steps to prepare our global franchise for the eventual recovery and outperform our competitors. Further it's our view that North America will continue to be the most adaptable market in terms of addressing well economics through both efficiency models and technology uptake. 
One way to look at it is that the U.S. unconventional business is now the lowest cost, fastest market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today. One thing we've helped our unconventional customers prove over the years is that they are smart, technically savvy and very adaptable companies and I'm confident that this type of market will show that again. As a result, we believe that when the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and then Halliburton will be in best position to lead the way. We've been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we'll execute on that experience.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"

I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014, while operating income declined 28% to approximately $700 million. As expected, we experienced typical first quarter sequential decline in revenue and margins due to the absence of high year-end software and product sales in the fourth quarter as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and the Bakken. The decline this year was obviously exacerbated by the macro headwinds facing the industry.
Now let me compare our geographic results to the first quarter of 2014. In the Eastern Hemisphere, first quarter revenue was essentially flat and operating income increased 3% over prior year despite activity and pricing headwinds. We have consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of revenue growth over the last few years and we expect that this will be true for the first quarter once all of our peers have reported. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 13% and 33%, respectively. This excellent improvement was led by solid growth and integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and India that was partially offset by declines in Malaysia and Australia.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw first quarter revenue and operating income declined 16% and 41%, respectively. Significant activity declines in Angola and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea along with currency and sanction related issues in Russia led to the lower results for the region. Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 22%, respectively, primarily due to higher and conventional drilling in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela. 
Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 9% and 54%, respectively, relative to a 21% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. Lower commodity prices have translated into severe reductions in activity levels throughout the first quarter accompanied by significant price reductions. Primarily as a result of the market declines that is affecting all of our operations globally, we incurred $1.2 billion of charges in the first quarter consisting of asset write-offs including our entire operations in Libya and Yemen, severance related costs, inventory write-downs, impairments of intangible assets and facility closures and other items. Over the last 2 quarters, we reduced our headcount by approximately 9,000 employees, more than 10% of our global headcount. As Jeff indicated, we are continuing to take a hard look at our operations. Additional actions will likely be required in the second quarter, although we expect further charges will be significantly smaller. 
Our Corporate and Other expenses totaled $69 million for the quarter, slightly lower than originally anticipated. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for 2015.
During the quarter, we adopted the new free-floating market exchange rate in Venezuela, resulting in an approximate 200 million foreign currency loss. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 26% due to a higher mix of international earnings and other favorable tax benefits. For the second quarter, we're expecting the effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%.
For capital expenditures, given the severity of the decline in activity levels, we are now reducing our capital spend for the year by $500 million or approximately 15% to $2.8 billion. Because we manufacture our own equipment, we have the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market. Our objective is to look beyond the cycle and we continue to be committed to investing in certain strategic technologies such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older, more costly equipment. Our rolled out strategy related to this initiative is not impacted as a result of our new capital guidance and therefore, we still expect to be approximately 50% converted to the Frac of the Future by year-end.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our second quarter operational outlook. In North America, the average U.S. rig count for the second quarter is already down nearly 30% compared to the first quarter and we expect further activity declines and for pricing to remain under pressure. As a result, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline in the second quarter, but as a reminder, we typically outpaced changes in the average rig count. We also expect margins to dip lower to the mid-single digits with our sequential decrementals improving compared to the first quarter as we begin to see the impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower input costs from our suppliers.
Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, in the second quarter, we are anticipating both revenue and margins to be in line with the first quarter levels as the typical seasonal improvements are expected to be offset by customer budget reductions and pricing concessions. In Latin America, for the second quarter, we expect a revenue decline in the upper teens with low double-digit margins. The main driver of this is our Venezuela operations where revenues are expected to decline by 50% sequentially as a result of the recent currency devaluation. In addition, we expect to see budget constraints in Mexico and reduced activity in Brazil and Colombia.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark for an update on the pending Baker acquisition. Mark?"

It's good to be back on the call and I'm excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we're making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.Let me begin with some of the more recen",629,"Thanks, Christian, and good morning. It's good to be back on the call and I'm excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we're making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.
Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. On March 27, we announced that the transaction was approved by the shareholders of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. We were pleased that nearly 99% of the shares voted at a Halliburton special meeting voted in favor of the proposal and that more than 98% of the shares voted at Baker Hughes special meeting voted in favor of the transaction. These results are a strong vote of confidence from our shareholders and we believe reflect their enthusiasm for the strategic and financial merits of the combination. 
When we announced the transaction last November, we discussed the likelihood of divestitures and our confidence that the combination will be achievable from a regulatory standpoint. On April 7, we announced that we will be marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. The 2014 revenue associated with these businesses was approximately $3.5 billion. We are very pleased with the strong interest that's been expressed in these assets by potential buyers both within the energy industry as well as outside the industry, including a number of very capable financial sponsors. We'll begin the marketing process in the coming weeks. The eventual sale of these businesses is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction. 
We expect there will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time. However, launching the sale of the Drill Bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process. We are continuing to respond to the second information request from the Department of Justice and outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings with the competition authorities and foreign jurisdictions. We believe we remain on track to complete the transaction late in the second half of 2015.
Now turning to integration planning. Since launching the process in early December, we've been focused on developing a comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful integration plan to make the postclosing transition as seamless, efficient and productive as possible, but also to fully capture the financial and strategic benefits of the combination. Working in parallel with the Baker Hughes integration team, we are bringing together the talent and expertise of both companies to build an even stronger combined organization as well as ensure that the planning efforts results in a robust integration plan for each and every functional and operational area of both businesses. We're preparing such that on day 1 after the close, we can immediately begin integration and start capturing the value inherent in this combination and deliver on the estimated synergies. 
Regardless of market conditions and the actions both we and Baker Hughes have taken to date, we continue to target annual pretax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident that we can achieve our synergy objective.
In closing, we remain enthusiastic about and fully commitment to closing this compelling transaction. We're very excited about the benefits this combination will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination will create a bell weather global oil field services company and together with Baker Hughes, we will combine our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of solutions to our customers.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks."

To sum it up, I want to thank the Halliburton team for avoiding distractions and maintaining their focus during the downturn. We're excited about the pending Baker acquisition. We're making great progress and believe we're on track to close late in the second half of this year. It's a tough market out there and we're not going to try to call a recovery. There is just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion. Instead we're focused on the things we can control. Things like rightsizing the business to current activity levels, preparing for the Baker integration by preserving our service delivery platform, collaborating with our customers to address their well costs, protecting market share with key customers, but turning down work when baseline economic thresholds don't make sense. Continuing to work with our supply chain to properly adjust cost to current marketing conditions, we made progress here but there's still more to get. And finally, investing to preserve the long-term value of the franchise. So whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We demonstrated this during previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different.

So don't know when it is, but really it's a guess on when activities stabilizes. In terms of the service delivery platform, the cost that we are keeping in anticipation of the Baker acquisitions. First of all, those costs that we are keeping are global in nature, but it certainly more impactful in the North America. There's several examples of those buckets of costs. One is our footprint, we operate in about 20 districts in North America and the type of downturn that we're seeing, a severe -- as we are seeing, we would consider consolidating some of them. The other one is management organization, so we have a management layer of between the districts and the areas. We would probably have considered collapsing them. And the third, as you know, we've been building our logistics capability in the last few years. The sand plants, where we have transporting facilities in all of the basins or rail car network. We would have probably dismantled portions of it as activity declined, however, we are keeping all that because we're expecting the increased volumes from  Baker and in terms of the margin impact of this, they will probably range between 200 to 300 basis points."

First of all, we continue to target internally a synergy cases beyond the 2. In order to achieve, you've got to reach high and so we're looking at every single thing that we can go after, that's why we remain confident. In the downturn itself, certainly there are actions that are being taken both by Halliburton and Baker Hughes that impact employee counts, facility closures and a lot of other things, some of which you would say would likely would be something that would be in the synergy case itself, but the difference is, is that most of these changes are being done in response to the market downturn. And the question, ultimately comes to okay, when the market comes back, what happens to those costs? In order for the synergy case to be ultimately captured, we've got to make process changes, procedural changes, changes of the way that we do business between the 2 companies, that ultimately captures those synergies, so that when the business does come back, the cost associated with those activities does not. And so that's why the plans that we're making, the integration continue to really drive after the fundamental process and procedural changes behind it to make sure that we secure those synergies not just for the current period, but forever."

We're going to run a process for each business for the 2 -- for the ones that have been announced will run 2 separate processes. We'll run a process over the top of them in case there are buyers that are interested in all of the businesses in combination. But we think by doing it in that way, that gives adequate and complete opportunity for anybody who's interested to participate in the, and to stake their claim. The process themselves generally, will stretch I'm going to guess about 5 months, so it's going to be in the latter part of the summer before, that we'll probably have identified buyers before we can really make any kind of announcements, we're going to have to go back to have conversations with the department of justice and other competition authorities who are looking at this to make sure that the buyers that have been identified will be acceptable to them. Remember that the process is not just divestiture for the sake of getting proceeds, the process here is to make sure that we're maintaining competition in the marketplace. And so they'll have an interest in making sure that we identified buyers are going to be able to make sure that those businesses will be sustainable in the marketplace and be viable competitors once that process is completed."

Now that's against the backdrop of 55,000 wells that were drilled last year. That's one thought and then the second is it's really a limited subset of customers that can even afford to talk about drilled, but uncompleted wells.

It was a challenging quarter for the service industry, which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodit",1988,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry, which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodity prices. 
For Halliburton, total company revenue of $7.1 billion was a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 relative to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count, once again representing industry-leading revenue performance. Operating income declined 28% year-over-year to approximately $700 million, driven by North America and Europe/Africa/CIS. The industry experienced unprecedented decline in the North America drilling activity during the first quarter, which significantly impacted our financial results. U.S. rig count has dropped approximately 50% from the peak in late November and we're still seeing activity fall off week-to-week, although the pace of decline has slowed. 
Looking back over the last several major cycles, the speed of this downturn has been historically high. Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity and available equipment chasing the work that remains, this is an extremely competitive market. We're seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and a significant amount of service capacity is looking for work. Service company behavior has fallen in really into 1 in 3 buckets: first, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors; second, those who've decided that covering fixed costs is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss; and third, those who are basically working at a price, which covers only their cash costs. 
Ultimately, neither model 2 or 3 is sustainable and we believe capacity adjustments are likely in a market like this. We're not going to call the bottom. But historically, it's taken rig count 3 quarters to move from peak to trough. Once we see activity stabilize, the healing process can begin. But it takes time. Our input costs can then start to catch up with service pricing declines and our efficiency programs and well solutions can start driving margins upwards. Now what is not unique about this downturn is that customer, service company and supplier behavior is pretty much as you would expect. What is unique is the speed at which this is happening. We believe that the operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners and so will the vendors who work with us to get through it.
Outside of North America, the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market, but were not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. The international rig count is down 9% from the peak last July and we're seeing customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the lower cash flows available to operators, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs and are asking oil service companies, engineering companies and fabricators to offer solutions, including pricing concessions. We're working with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. 
As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions this year with full year international spending reflecting a midteens reduction. We still expect Middle East/Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia, Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is experiencing significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In particular, the offshore markets are facing extremely challenging economics. We've already seen significant delays in exploration work in these markets with a number of pending opportunities still at risk as operators work to balance their budgets. 
And in Latin America, we expect lower activity levels across the region with the largest declines projected in Mexico as a result of budget constraints, and Colombia, where operators are sizing their programs to live within cash flows. 
In addition, we anticipate lower revenue resulting from the new Venezuelan exchange rate. 
Given the near-term headwinds that we're seeing globally, our focus is on controlling what's within our control. First, after taking a hard look at our global operations in the first quarter, we streamlined our business primarily through headcount and asset reductions while not impacting our service delivery model, which resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge, including a complete write-off of our operations in both Libya and Yemen. Christian will provide more details later in the call.
Second, we're continuing to work with our suppliers. As we discussed last quarter, there's a delay in realizing cost savings from our suppliers. Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year. We are pleased that many of our key vendors now realize the type of market that we are in and they're working with us to allow us to get our input costs more competitive. We're also looking at consolidating our vendor lists into fewer companies that we can commit more volume to going forward.
Third, we are staying focused on service execution and collaborating with our customers to reduce their well costs. 
Fourth, we are playing offense. We are focused on the utilization of our deployed assets and we are defending our market share with key customers. 
And finally and most importantly, we are still a returns-driven organization, and where pricing concessions would have pushed returns below an acceptable threshold, we have instead elected to stack equipment, including frac lease. Given the unsustainable prices we've seen some of our competition willing to work for, we would rather save our equipment for better times. 
One other thing I need to point out is that, in a typical downturn, we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done, but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year, we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform. We know we have best-in-class service delivery and keeping this platform in peak condition will allow us to realize our transaction synergies postclose. This means that we are not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise, and consequently, we are carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins, it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.
As we've done in previous downturns, we are looking through the cycle and investing capital in strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to position ourselves to be able to accelerate out of the downturn when the market recovers. This includes investing in key technologies and capabilities that allow us to deliver our value proposition in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. 
As I mentioned previously, we are always working closely with customers around the world to help them lower their cost per barrel of oil equivalent. We approach this in 2 ways: first, through more efficient, more reliable, lower cost delivery platform; and second, through technology that reduces uncertainty and makes better wells. In terms of efficiency, this is where innovations like our Frac of the Future with its increased reliability and lower cost profile become important differentiators. Our Q10 pump supports our surface efficiencies strategy, which will enable us to lower operators' costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. This is also where we leverage the scale of our global logistics network and supply chain. 
Now just as important, we're working with our customers to help them make better wells through subsurface insight and custom chemistry. Our CoreVault system is a great example of delivering subsurface insight where we're able to collect multiple core samples during a single trip and preserve 100% of the downhole fluid for analysis. This accelerates our customer's reservoir understanding, more precisely locates hydrocarbons and helps them fully understand the economic value of their asset. We're doing this today in every North American basin and have recently expanded into Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Our CYPHER Seismic-to-Stimulation Service is gaining traction, helping more customers maximize the value of their unconventional assets. Our CYPHER project count actually increased sequentially even as activity levels declined. The added projects included both existing customers expanding their programs as well as customers new to the CYPHER platform. 
And finally, custom chemistry where we are pleased with the expansion of AccessFrac, which helps our customers efficiently and effectively stimulate the entire lateral. In addition to being used in 12 basins around the world, AccessFrac is also seeing significant uptake as a re-frac solution in North America. When deploying our proprietary chemical diversion technology into early unconventional oil wells, we've seen instances where the estimated ultimate recovery has more than doubled. 
There's been a lot of discussion around inventory wells: operators choosing to drill, but not complete wells and then defer production until commodity prices become more favorable. Third-party estimates put this number around 4,000 wells. 
It is our view that although inventory wells can exacerbate the short-term activity declines for completions, it essentially defers the revenue opportunity. When our customers decide to increase activity levels, this will be beneficial for Halliburton as they're likely to increase completions and tandem with new well drilling, which could accelerate our rate of recovery during the up cycle. 
Now before I turn the call over to Christian, I want to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. 
Over the past several months, global demand expectations for 2015 have been consistently revised higher, now calling for an increase of over 1 million barrels per day including recent upward revisions for both U.S. and Europe. On the supply side, we're all watching U.S. production levels very closely given the volume expansions that took place throughout 2013 and 2014. Recently, monthly production estimates have been encouraging, however, showing significantly lower production growth and actually projecting oil production to be flat to down in the major basins. 
In terms of international production, non-OPEC estimates continue to be trimmed and we see this as an overlooked positive factor. Comparing the IEA forecast exit rate for 2015 against 2014, key non-OPEC contributors are expected to decline. With further reduction expected as a result of declining global rig count, we view this as ultimately constructive for the prospect of supply-demand equilibrium. Whether we reach this point in months or quarters, Halliburton will continue to take the necessary steps to prepare our global franchise for the eventual recovery and to outperform our competitors. Further, it's our view that North America will continue to be the most adaptable market in terms of addressing well economics through both efficiency models and technology uptake. One way to look at it is that the U.S. unconventional business is now the lowest cost, fastest to market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today. One thing we've helped our unconventional customers prove over the years is that they are smart, technically savvy and very adaptable companies and I'm confident that this type of market will show that again. 
As a result, we believe that when the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and then Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way. We've been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we'll execute on that experience.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"

I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately",905,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately $700 million. As expected, we experienced typical first quarter sequential decline in revenue and margins due to the absence of high year-end software and product sales in the fourth quarter as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and the Bakken. The decline this year was obviously exacerbated by the macro headwinds facing the industry.
Now let me compare our geographic results to the first quarter of 2014. In the Eastern Hemisphere, first quarter revenue was essentially flat and operating income increased 3% over prior year despite activity and pricing headwinds. We have consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of revenue growth over the last few years and we expect that this will be true for the first quarter once all of our peers have reported. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 13% and 33%, respectively. This excellent improvement was led by solid growth and integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and India that was partially offset by declines in Malaysia and Australia.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw first quarter revenue and operating income declined 16% and 41%, respectively. Significant activity declines in Angola and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea along with currency and sanction-related issues in Russia, led to the lower results for the region. 
Latin America revenue and operating income 
increased by 10% and 22%, respectively, primarily due to higher unconventional drilling in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela. 
Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 9% and 54%, respectively, relative to a 21% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. Lower commodity prices have translated into severe reductions in activity levels throughout the first quarter accompanied by significant price reductions. 
Primarily as a result of the market decline that is affecting all of our operations globally, we incurred $1.2 billion of charges in the first quarter consisting of asset write-offs including our entire operations in Libya and Yemen, severance-related costs, inventory write-downs, impairments of intangible assets and facility closures and other items. Over the last 2 quarters, we have reduced our headcount by approximately 9,000 employees, more than 10% of our global headcount. As Jeff indicated, we are continuing to take a hard look at our operations. Additional actions will likely be required in the second quarter, although we expect further charges will be significantly smaller. 
Our Corporate and Other expenses totaled $69 million for the quarter, slightly lower than originally anticipated. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for 2015.
During the quarter, we adopted the new free-floating market exchange rate in Venezuela, resulting in an approximate $200 million foreign currency loss. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 26% due to a higher mix of international earnings and other favorable tax benefits. For the second quarter, we are expecting the effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%.
For capital expenditures, given the severity of the decline in activity levels, we are now reducing our capital spend for the year by $500 million or approximately 15% to $2.8 billion. Because we manufacture our own equipment, we have the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market. Our objective is to look beyond the cycle, and we continue to be committed to investing in certain strategic technologies such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older, more costly equipment. Our rollout strategy related to this initiative is not impacted as a result of our new capital guidance, and therefore, we still expect to be approximately 50% converted to the Frac of the Future by year-end.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our second quarter operational outlook. In North America, the average U.S. rig count for the second quarter is already down nearly 30% compared to the first quarter and we expect further activity declines and for pricing to remain under pressure. As a result, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline in the second quarter. But as a reminder, we typically outpace changes in the average rig count. We also expect margins to drift lower to the mid-single digits with our sequential decrementals improving compared to the first quarter as we begin to see the impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower input costs from our suppliers.
Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we are anticipating both revenue and margins to be in line with the first quarter levels as the typical seasonal improvements are expected to be offset by customer budget reductions and pricing concessions. In Latin America, for the second quarter, we expect a revenue decline in the upper teens with low double-digit margins. The main driver of this is our Venezuela operations where revenues are expected to decline by 50% sequentially as a result of the recent currency devaluation. In addition, we expect to see budget constraints in Mexico and reduced activity in Brazil and Colombia.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark for an update on the pending Baker acquisition. Mark?"

It's good to be back on the call and I'm excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we're making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.
Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. On March 27, we announced that the transaction was approved by the shareholders of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. We were pleased that nearly 99% of the shares voted at a Halliburton special meeting voted in favor of the proposal and that more than 98% of the shares voted at Baker Hughes special meeting voted in favor of the transaction. These results are a strong vote of confidence from our shareholders and we believe reflect their enthusiasm for the strategic and financial merits of the combination. 
When we announced the transaction last November, we discussed the likelihood of divestitures and our confidence that the combination will be achievable from a regulatory standpoint. On April 7, we announced that we will be marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. The 2014 revenue associated with these businesses was approximately $3.5 billion. We are very pleased with the strong interest that's been expressed in these assets by potential buyers both within the energy industry as well as outside the industry, including a number of very capable financial sponsors. We'll begin the marketing process in the coming weeks. The eventual sale of these businesses is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction. 
We expect there will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time. However, launching the sale of the Drill Bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process. We are continuing to respond to the second information request from the Department of Justice, and outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings with the competition authorities in foreign jurisdictions. We believe we remain on track to complete the transaction late in the second half of 2015.
Now turning to integration planning. Since launching the process in early December, we've been focused on developing a comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful integration plan to make the postclosing transition as seamless, efficient and productive as possible, but also to fully capture the financial and strategic benefits of the combination. Working in parallel with the Baker Hughes integration team, we are bringing together the talent and expertise of both companies to build an even stronger combined organization as well as ensure that the planning efforts results in a robust integration plan for each and every functional and operational area of both businesses. We're preparing such that on day 1 after the close, we can immediately begin the integration and start capturing the value inherent in this combination and deliver on the estimated synergies. 
Regardless of market conditions and the actions both we and Baker Hughes have taken to date, we continue to target annual pretax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident that we can achieve our synergy objective.
In closing, we remain enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We're very excited about the benefits this combination will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination will create a bellwether global oil field services company, and together with Baker Hughes, we will combine our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of solutions to our customers.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks."

It's a tough market out there and we're not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion. Instead, we're focused on the things we can control, things like rightsizing the business to current activity levels; preparing for the Baker integration by preserving our service delivery platform; collaborating with our customers to address their well costs; protecting market share with key customers, but turning down work when baseline economic thresholds don't make sense; continuing to work with our supply chain to properly adjust costs to current marketing conditions, we've made progress here but there's still more to get; and finally, investing to preserve the long-term value of the franchise.

You have 2 questions, one is what happens in the North American margins in the second half of the year. We're not going to provide guidance, as Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks, the healing process starts when activity stabilizes and then pricing stabilizes and then we'll see the benefits of the adjustments in cost structure that we've taken. So don't know when it is, but really it's a guess on when activity stabilizes. In terms of the service delivery platform, the costs that we are keeping in anticipation of the Baker acquisitions, first of all, those costs that we are keeping are global in nature, but it certainly more impactful in North America. There are several examples of those buckets of costs. One is our footprint, we operate in about 20 districts in North America. And with the type of downturn that we're seeing, as severe as we are seeing, we would consider consolidating some of them. The other one is management organization, so we have a management layer of between the districts and the areas. We would probably have considered collapsing them. And the third, as you know, we've been building our logistics capability in the last few years: sand plants, we have transloading facilities in all of the basins, our rail car network. We would have probably dismantled portions of it as activity declined, however, we are keeping all those because we're expecting the increased volumes from  Baker. And in terms of the margin impact of this, I can say we'd probably range between 200 to 300 basis points."

We can't get after any of the integration actions until the closing happens. But I think to address your first question, there are a couple of things to note. First of all, we continue to target internally synergy cases beyond the two. I mean, in order to achieve, too, you've got to reach high and so we're looking at every single thing that we can go after, that's why we remain confident. In the downturn itself, certainly there are actions that are being taken both by Halliburton and Baker Hughes that impact employee counts, facility closures and a lot of other things, some of which you will say would likely would be something that would be in the synergy case itself. But the difference is, is that most of these changes are being done in response to the market downturn. And the question ultimately comes to, okay, when the market comes back, what happens to those costs? In order for the synergy case to be ultimately captured, we've got to make process changes, procedural changes, changes to the way that we do business between the 2 companies that ultimately captures those synergies. So that when the business does come back, the costs associated with those activities does not. And so that's why the plans that we're making, the integration, continue to really drive after the fundamental process and procedural changes behind it to make sure that we secure those synergies not just for the current period, but forever."

The processes themselves generally will stretch, I'm going to guess, about 5 months. So it's going to be in the latter part of the summer before -- that we'll probably have identified buyers before we can really make any kind of announcements. We're going to have to go back to have conversations with the Department of Justice and other competition authorities who are looking at this to make sure that the buyers that have been identified will be acceptable to them. Remember that the process is not just divestiture for the sake of getting proceeds. The process here is to make sure that we're maintaining competition in the marketplace and so they'll have an interest in making sure that the identified buyers are going to be able to make sure that those businesses will be sustainable in the marketplace and be viable competitors once that process is completed."

So that's one thought. And then the second is it's really a limited subset of customers that can even afford to talk about drilled, but uncompleted wells, at least as a practice.

It was a challenging quarter for the service industry, which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodit",1989,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry, which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodity prices. 
For Halliburton, total company revenue of $7.1 billion was a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 relative to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count, once again representing industry-leading revenue performance. Operating income declined 28% year-over-year to approximately $700 million, driven by North America and Europe/Africa/CIS. The industry experienced unprecedented decline in the North America drilling activity during the first quarter, which significantly impacted our financial results. U.S. rig count has dropped approximately 50% from the peak in late November and we're still seeing activity fall off week-to-week, although the pace of decline has slowed. 
Looking back over the last several major cycles, the speed of this downturn has been historically high. Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity in available equipment chasing the work that remains, this is an extremely competitive market. We're seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and a significant amount of service capacity is looking for work. Service company behavior has fallen in really into 1 of 3 buckets: first, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors; second, those who've decided that covering fixed cost is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss; and third, those who are basically working at a price, which covers only their cash costs. 
Ultimately, neither model 2 or 3 is sustainable and we believe capacity adjustments are likely in a market like this. We're not going to call the bottom. But historically, it's taken rig count 3 quarters to move from peak to trough. Once we see activity stabilize, the healing process can begin. But it takes time. Our input costs can then start to catch up with service pricing declines in our efficiency programs and well solutions can start driving margins upwards. Now what is not unique about this downturn is that customer, service company and supplier behavior is pretty much as you would expect. What is unique is the speed at which this is happening. We believe that the operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners and so will the vendors who work with us to get through it.
Outside of North America, the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market, but were not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. The international rig count is down 9% from the peak last July and we're seeing customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the lower cash flows available to operators, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs and are asking oil service companies, engineering companies and fabricators to offer solutions, including pricing concessions. We're working with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. 
As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions this year with full year international spending reflecting a midteens reduction. We still expect Middle East/Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia, Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is experiencing significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In particular, the offshore markets are facing extremely challenging economics. We've already seen significant delays in exploration work in these markets with a number of pending opportunities still at risk as operators work to balance their budgets. 
And in Latin America, we expect lower activity levels across the region, with the largest declines projected in Mexico as a result of budget constraints, and Colombia, where operators are sizing their programs to live within cash flows.  In addition, we anticipate lower revenue resulting from the new Venezuelan exchange rate. 
Given the near-term headwinds that we're seeing globally, our focus is on controlling what's within our control. First, after taking a hard look at our global operations in the first quarter, we streamlined our business primarily through headcount and asset reductions while not impacting our service delivery model, which resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge, including a complete write-off of our operations in both Libya and Yemen. Christian will provide more details later in the call.
Second, we're continuing to work with our suppliers. As we discussed last quarter, there's a delay in realizing cost savings from our suppliers. Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year. We are pleased that many of our key vendors now realize the type of market that we are in and they're working with us to allow us to get our input costs more competitive. We're also looking at consolidating our vendor lists into fewer companies that we can commit more volume to going forward.
Third, we are staying focused on service execution and collaborating with our customers to reduce their well costs. Fourth, we are playing offense. We are focused on the utilization of our deployed assets and we are defending our market share with key customers.  And finally and most importantly, we are still a returns-driven organization, and where pricing concessions would have pushed returns below an acceptable threshold, we have instead elected to stack equipment, including frac fleets. Given the unsustainable prices we've seen some of our competition willing to work for, we would rather save our equipment for better times. 
One other thing I need to point out is that, in a typical downturn, we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done, but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year, we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform. We know we have best-in-class service delivery and keeping this platform in peak condition will allow us to realize our transaction synergies post close. This means that we are not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise, and consequently, we are carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins, it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.
As we've done in previous downturns, we are looking through the cycle and investing capital in strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to position ourselves to be able to accelerate out of the downturn when the market recovers. This includes investing in key technologies and capabilities that allow us to deliver our value proposition in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. 
As I mentioned previously, we are always working closely with customers around the world to help them lower their cost per barrel of oil equivalent. We approach this in 2 ways: first, through more efficient, more reliable, lower cost delivery platform; and second, through technology that reduces uncertainty and makes better wells. In terms of efficiency, this is where innovations like our Frac of the Future, with its increased reliability and lower cost profile, become important differentiators. Our Q10 pump supports our surface efficiencies strategy, which will enable us to lower operators' costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. This is also where we leverage the scale of our global logistics network and supply chain. 
Now just as important, we're working with our customers to help them make better wells through subsurface insight and custom chemistry. Our CoreVault system is a great example of delivering subsurface insight where we're able to collect multiple core samples during a single trip and preserve 100% of the downhole fluid for analysis. This accelerates our customers' reservoir understanding, more precisely locates hydrocarbons and helps them fully understand the economic value of their asset. We're doing this today in every North American basin and have recently expanded into Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Our CYPHER Seismic-to-Stimulation Service is gaining traction, helping more customers maximize the value of their unconventional assets. Our CYPHER project count actually increased sequentially even as activity levels declined. The added projects included both existing customers expanding their programs as well as customers new to the CYPHER platform. And finally, custom chemistry where we are pleased with the expansion of AccessFrac, which helps our customers efficiently and effectively stimulate the entire lateral. In addition to being used in 12 basins around the world, AccessFrac is also seeing significant uptake as a re-frac solution in North America. 
When deploying our proprietary chemical diversion technology into early unconventional oil wells, we've seen instances where the estimated ultimate recovery has more than doubled.  There's been a lot of discussion around inventory wells: operators choosing to drill, but not complete wells and then defer production until commodity prices become more favorable. Third-party estimates put this number around 4,000 wells. And it's our view that although inventory wells can exacerbate the short-term activity declines for completions, it essentially defers the revenue opportunity. When our customers decide to increase activity levels, this will be beneficial for Halliburton as they're likely to increase completions and tandem with new well drilling, which could accelerate our rate of recovery during the up cycle. 
Now before I turn the call over to Christian, I want to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. Over the past several months, global demand expectations for 2015 have been consistently revised higher, now calling for an increase of over 1 million barrels per day including recent upward revisions for both U.S. and Europe. On the supply side, we're all watching U.S. production levels very closely given the volume expansions that took place throughout 2013 and 2014. Recently, monthly production estimates have been encouraging, however, showing significantly lower production growth and actually projecting oil production to be flat to down in the major basins. 
In terms of international production, non-OPEC estimates continue to be trimmed and we see this as an overlooked positive factor. Comparing the IEA forecast exit rate for 2015 against 2014, key non-OPEC contributors are expected to decline. With further reduction expected as a result of declining global rig count, we view this as ultimately constructive for the prospect of supply-demand equilibrium. Whether we reach this point in months or quarters, Halliburton will continue to take the necessary steps to prepare our global franchise for the eventual recovery and to outperform our competitors. Further, it's our view that North America will continue to be the most adaptable market in terms of addressing well economics through both efficiency models and technology uptake. 
One way to look at it is that the U.S. unconventional business is now the lowest cost, fastest to market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today. One thing we've helped our unconventional customers prove over the years is that they are smart, technically savvy and very adaptable companies and I'm confident that this type of market will show that again.  As a result, we believe that when the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way. We've been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we'll execute on that experience.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"

I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately",905,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately $700 million. As expected, we experienced typical first quarter sequential decline in revenue and margins due to the absence of high year-end software and product sales in the fourth quarter as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and the Bakken. The decline this year was obviously exacerbated by the macro headwinds facing the industry.
Now let me compare our geographic results to the first quarter of 2014. In the Eastern Hemisphere, first quarter revenue was essentially flat and operating income increased 3% over prior year despite activity and pricing headwinds. We have consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of revenue growth over the last few years and we expect that this will be true for the first quarter once all of our peers have reported. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 13% and 33%, respectively. This excellent improvement was led by solid growth and integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and India that was partially offset by declines in Malaysia and Australia.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw first quarter revenue and operating income declined 16% and 41%, respectively. Significant activity declines in Angola and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea along with currency and sanction-related issues in Russia, led to the lower results for the region. Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 22%, respectively, primarily due to higher unconventional drilling in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela. 
Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 9% and 54%, respectively, relative to a 21% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. Lower commodity prices have translated into severe reductions in activity levels throughout the first quarter accompanied by significant price reductions. 
Primarily as a result of the market decline that is affecting all of our operations globally, we incurred $1.2 billion of charges in the first quarter consisting of asset write-offs including our entire operations in Libya and Yemen, severance-related costs, inventory write-downs, impairments of intangible assets and facility closures and other items. Over the last 2 quarters, we have reduced our headcount by approximately 9,000 employees, more than 10% of our global headcount. As Jeff indicated, we are continuing to take a hard look at our operations. Additional actions will likely be recorded in the second quarter, although we expect further charges will be significantly smaller. 
Our Corporate and Other expenses totaled $69 million for the quarter, slightly lower than originally anticipated. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for 2015. During the quarter, we adopted the new free-floating market exchange rate in Venezuela, resulting in an approximate $200 million foreign currency loss. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 26% due to a higher mix of international earnings and other favorable tax benefits. For the second quarter, we are expecting the effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%.
For capital expenditures, given the severity of the decline in activity levels, we are now reducing our capital spend for the year by $500 million or approximately 15% to $2.8 billion. Because we manufacture our own equipment, we have the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market. Our objective is to look beyond the cycle, and we continue to be committed to investing in certain strategic technologies such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older, more costly equipment. Our rollout strategy related to this initiative is not impacted as a result of our new capital guidance, and therefore, we still expect to be approximately 50% converted to the Frac of the Future by year-end.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our second quarter operational outlook. In North America, the average U.S. rig count for the second quarter is already down nearly 30% compared to the first quarter and we expect further activity declines and for pricing to remain under pressure. As a result, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline in the second quarter. But as a reminder, we typically outpace changes in the average rig count. We also expect margins to drift lower to the mid-single digits with our sequential decrementals improving compared to the first quarter as we begin to see the impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower input costs from our suppliers.
Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we are anticipating both revenue and margins to be in line with the first quarter levels as the typical seasonal improvements are expected to be offset by customer budget reductions and pricing concessions. In Latin America, for the second quarter, we expect a revenue decline in the upper teens with low double-digit margins. The main driver of this is our Venezuela operations where revenues are expected to decline by 50% sequentially as a result of the recent currency devaluation. In addition, we expect to see budget constraints in Mexico and reduced activity in Brazil and Colombia.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark for an update on the pending Baker acquisition. Mark?"

It's good to be back on the call and I'm excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we're making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.Let me begin with some of the more recen",629,"Thanks, Christian, and good morning. It's good to be back on the call and I'm excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we're making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.
Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. On March 27, we announced that the transaction was approved by the shareholders of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. We were pleased that nearly 99% of the shares voted at a Halliburton special meeting voted in favor of the proposal and that more than 98% of the shares voted at Baker Hughes special meeting voted in favor of the transaction. These results are a strong vote of confidence from our shareholders and we believe reflect their enthusiasm for the strategic and financial merits of the combination. 
When we announced the transaction last November, we discussed the likelihood of divestitures and our confidence that the combination will be achievable from a regulatory standpoint. On April 7, we announced that we will be marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. The 2014 revenue associated with these businesses was approximately $3.5 billion. We are very pleased with the strong interest that's been expressed in these assets by potential buyers both within the energy industry as well as outside the industry, including a number of very capable financial sponsors. We'll begin the marketing process in the coming weeks. The eventual sale of these businesses is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction. 
We expect there will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time. However, launching the sale of the Drill Bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process. We are continuing to respond to the second information request from the Department of Justice, and outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings with the competition authorities in foreign jurisdictions. We believe we remain on track to complete the transaction late in the second half of 2015.
Now turning to integration planning. Since launching the process in early December, we've been focused on developing a comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful integration plan to make the post-closing transition as seamless, efficient and productive as possible, but also to fully capture the financial and strategic benefits of the combination. Working in parallel with the Baker Hughes integration team, we are bringing together the talent and expertise of both companies to build an even stronger combined organization as well as ensure that the planning efforts results in a robust integration plan for each and every functional and operational area of both businesses. We're preparing such that on day 1 after the close, we can immediately begin the integration and start capturing the value inherent in this combination and deliver on the estimated synergies.  Regardless of market conditions and the actions both we and Baker Hughes have taken to date, we continue to target annual pretax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident that we can achieve our synergy objective.
In closing, we remain enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We're very excited about the benefits this combination will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination will create a bellwether global oil field services company, and together with Baker Hughes, we will combine our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of solutions to our customers.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks."

To sum it up, I want to thank the Halliburton team for avoiding distractions and maintaining their focus during the downturn. We're excited about the pending Baker acquisition. We're making great progress and believe we're on track to close late in the second half of this year. 
It's a tough market out there and we're not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion. Instead, we're focused on the things we can control, things like rightsizing the business to current activity levels; preparing for the Baker integration by preserving our service delivery platform; collaborating with our customers to address their well costs; protecting market share with key customers, but turning down work when baseline economic thresholds don't make sense; continuing to work with our supply chain to properly adjust costs to current marketing conditions, we've made progress here but there's still more to get; and finally, investing to preserve the long-term value of the franchise. So whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We've demonstrated this during previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different.

You have 2 questions, one is what happens to North American margins in second half of the year. We're not going to provide guidance, as Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks, the healing process starts when activity stabilizes and then pricing stabilizes and then we'll see the benefits of the adjustments in cost structure that we've taken. So don't know what it is, but really it's a guess on when activity stabilizes. In terms of the service delivery platform, the costs that we are keeping in anticipation of the Baker acquisition, first of all, those costs that we are keeping are global in nature, but it certainly more impactful in North America. There are several examples of those buckets of costs. One is our footprint, we operate in about 20 districts in North America. And with the type of downturn that we're seeing, as severe as we are seeing, we would consider consolidating some of them. The other one is management organization, so we have a management layer of between the districts and the areas. We would probably have considered collapsing them. And the third, as you know, we've been building our logistics capability in the last few years: sand plants, we have transloading facilities in all of the basins, a rail car network. We would have probably dismantled portions of it as activity declined, however, we are keeping all those because we're expecting the increased volumes from Baker. And in terms of the margin impact of this, I can say we'd probably range between 200 to 300 basis points."

We can't get after any of the integration actions until the closing happens. But I think to address your first question, there are a couple things to note. First of all, we continue to target internally a synergy case that's beyond the $2 billion. I mean, in order to achieve $2 billion, you've got to reach high and so we're looking at every single thing that we can go after, and that's why we remain confident. In the downturn itself, certainly there are actions that are being taken both by Halliburton and Baker Hughes that impact employee counts, facility closures and a lot of other things, some of which you would say likely would be something that would be in the synergy case itself. But the difference is, is that most of these changes are being done in response to the market downturn. And the question ultimately comes to, okay, when the market comes back, what happens to those costs? In order for the synergy case to be ultimately captured, we've got to make process changes, procedural changes, changes to the way that we do business between the 2 companies that ultimately captures those synergies. So that when the business does come back, the cost associated with those activities does not. And so that's why the plans that we're making, the integration, continue to really drive after the fundamental process and procedural changes behind it to make sure that we secure those synergies not just for the current period, but forever."

So I don't think they've given -- concluded around the timing, though it would certainly be at a point in time that they see commodity prices rising as opposed to where they are. And I think around the dock inventory, it's worth a couple of comments. And first, it represents, we think, about 4,000 wells. That's against the backdrop of 55,000 wells that were drilled last year. So that's one thought. And then the second is it's really a limited subset of customers that can even afford to talk about drilled, but uncompleted wells, at least as a practice. So from our standpoint, without precision around the timing, it certainly looks like deferred revenue for Halliburton, and arguably when it occurs, it will accelerate sort of tightening and recovery."

Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of today's call.
During prepared remarks, they will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to ongoing discussions, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters.
Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website.
We have several moving pieces this quarter, so let me walk you through the numbers. As announced in our press release, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, excluding restructuring cost of $0.30 and acquisition-related costs of $0.08. However, as required by generally accepted accounting principles, included in our results was a $0.06 benefit related to the cessation of depreciation expense associated with the assets we are currently marketing in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Excluding the depreciation benefit would've resulted in earnings per share for the quarter of $0.38.
Going forward, the benefit associated with our assets held for sale should be factored into your financial models as this is the only quarter that we intend to disclose it separately.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave."

I'm also very pleased with our Eastern Hemisphere margin expansion, which once again outpaced our primary competitor. We generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. Operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels exacerbated by pricing declines, primarily in North America.
Revenue for North America was down 25% sequentially, significantly outperforming the 40% decline in the average rig count. And while the North American rig count declined 40%, our stage count declined less than 10%. Therefore, we believe that the customer flight quality emerged during the quarter, and this gives us reason to believe that pricing declines may begin to decelerate. And I can tell you our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable in this market. And although we experienced some weather disruptions, we were able to make up this work later in the quarter.
We continue to maintain an infrastructure well beyond current market needs ahead of the Baker transaction, incurring costs which we would have otherwise eliminated. This impacted margins by 300 to 400 basis points in Q2, and decremental margins this quarter were better than previous cycles, which demonstrates that our aggressive cost-reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. 
The U.S. rig count finished the quarter down 55% from the peak in late November that has moved sideways over the last few weeks. Price erosion continued in the second quarter and is likely to remain fluid in the near term. We anticipate margin compression in the third quarter but believe it will be driven more by the full impact of pricing declines that we gave up in the second quarter and from lower activity levels more than continued price erosion. In fact, we believe that service pricing for the industry has fallen to unsustainable levels. Last quarter, we described 3 types of service companies in the market: those making a profit, which weren't very many; those covering cash cost; and those operating at a loss even on a cash basis. 
During the first quarter, Halliburton was one of just a few companies that posted profits in North America, and we expect the second quarter has been even more challenging for those of us in the industry. As a result, we believe many of the smaller service companies are now operating below cash breakeven levels, which leads to the conclusion that pricing cannot stay at these levels for an extended period.
Now looking ahead, we could begin to see a modest uptick in activity during the second half of this year, which could include increased refract activity, which Jeff Miller will detail later. However, we are not expecting a meaningful activity increase until sometime in 2016, depending on the pace of production declines and where commodity prices settle out in the coming quarters. Therefore, what we are continuing to do is manage our cost, service our customers that are engaged in this flight quality and prepare for the Baker transaction.
Now outside North America, I'm very happy with where our international business is today. Our full year outlook for our international businesses remains unchanged. We still estimate a midteens decline in total international customer spend compared to last year. However, we expect to outpace the total market and believe our revenue decline will be less severe. We also anticipate our third quarter Eastern Hemisphere margins will be in the upper teens.
Now let me provide a little bit of international and regional color. In the Middle East/Asia, we see a solid and stable business as project awards across the Middle East are moving forward. Europe/Africa/CIS is challenged today with the North Sea, Russia and Angola markets being the most vulnerable. And in Latin America, operators are struggling with their cash flows. 
Although the international markets are more resilient than North America, they are certainly not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. We did experience some pricing declines in the first half of the year but negotiations are continuing, and we will not see lower pricing fully built into our run rate until the second half of the year. In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. 
The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same. We are continuing to employ a 2-pronged approach. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. To do this, we continue to invest in key technologies, build out capital equipment and prepare for our pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. 
The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn, joined upon our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input cost, eliminating discretionary spending, managing our business within our cash flows and protecting our market position.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the significant progress we are making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. During the quarter, we began marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. In early July, we received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses, all of which included prices, and we are very pleased with the prices and the response. Because of the high level of interest we received, we are limiting the number of bidders for the second round to only the strongest responses. We expect to complete the auction process sometime this fall, with the closing of the divestitures being concurrent with the closing of the larger transaction. 
We have also recently provided a proposal for additional divestitures to various competition authorities around the world. In aggregate, the total divestitures being considered are still within the scope of those contemplated by us at the time that we announced the transaction. 
On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ. Timing agreements are often entered into in connection with large complex transactions and provide the DOJ additional time to review responses to its second request. We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of the November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DOJ's second request. 
I am pleased to say that Baker Hughes did certify substantial compliance on July 14, and we expect to do so shortly. 
Outside of the U.S.A. we continue to make progress with the required filings in foreign jurisdictions. Specific to the European Union, we expect to submit our filings later this month, which will start the formal review process. We are fully committed to our target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement does provide that closing can be extended into 2016 if necessary.
As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion regardless of market conditions or any cost-reduction actions taken by either company to that date. 
In closing, we are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil services company, combining our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.
Now let me turn the call back over to Christian, who will provide you some details on our financial results. Christian?"

During the second quarter, we announced our decision to divest our Drill Bits and Drilling MWD LWD businesses. These businesses were classified as assets held for sale in the second quarter, and we seized the associated depreciation and amortization for these assets, resulting in an approximate $0.06 benefit to the quarter. We've included a table in our earnings release quantifying the second quarter profit uplift by geography. To provide better transparency of our current operational trends, the sequential comparisons in my comments today have been adjusted to exclude the special items indicated in our earnings release as well as the benefit of the lower depreciation, meaning both the first and second quarter results reflect the full depreciation burden in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison.
Now let me provide a comparison of our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.9 billion represented a 16% decline while operating income declined 18% to $570 million. [ph] North America led the decline as a result of lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure across all of our product lines.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, second quarter revenue declined by 3% while operating income increased 17%, representing a 300 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter levels despite activity and pricing headwinds.
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% while operating income showed a modest improvement. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were offset by improved profitability in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. We are pleased with the progress of operations in Iraq, where margins reached double digits for the first time, which we expect to sustain for the full year.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw second quarter revenue come in flat, with operating income increasing by 69%. Seasonal activity improvements in Eurasia and Norway, along with higher simulation activity in Completion Tools sales in both Algeria and Angola, drove the improvement for the quarter offsetting weaker activity levels in the U.K. and Egypt. 
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 19% and 21%, respectively, driven by Venezuela, primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate. Partially offsetting this decline was improved profitability in Brazil, resulting from the recently re-tendered Directional Drilling contract. 
Moving to North America. Revenue and operating income declined 25% and 59%, respectively, relative to a 40% reduction in the North American rig count. Lower customer budgets translated into additional reductions in activity levels throughout the second quarter, accompanied by further significant price reductions across all product lines. Our decrementals in the second quarter were 19%, about half of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2009.
During the second quarter, we took additional actions to adjust the cost structure due to the continued decline in the global activity levels. As a result, we incurred in additional after-tax restructuring charge of $258 million in the second quarter, consisting primarily of severance-related costs and asset write-offs. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have now reduced our global headcount by over 16%. We continue to evaluate our operations, and we'll make further adjustments as required to adjust to market conditions. 
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the third quarter will be approximately $75 million, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the remainder of 2015.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 26% and is expected to be between 26% and 27% for the remainder of the year.
We continue to focus on cash flow generation. And given the continued decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital spend for the year by another $200 million to $2.6 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our third quarter operations outlook. My guidance commentary will include the benefit of our lower depreciation and amortization run rate from assets held for sale. 
Starting with the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. We expect to see a full quarter impact of price reductions, which will affect our third quarter results. We currently expect a low to mid-single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins declining modestly into the upper teens. For Latin America, we also anticipate a modest decline in the third quarter for both revenues and margins.
In North America, if we extrapolate the current rig count forward, it suggests that the average rig count for the third quarter should decline by at least 5% compared to the prior quarter. This, in combination with a full quarter impact of lower pricing, leads us to believe that revenues and margins in the third quarter will be under pressure. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles where we typically see at least a 1 quarter lag when the market is transitioning towards the bottom. Based on our visibility today, we're currently expecting a low single digit decline in sequential revenues with margins also drifting modestly lower.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company, and our guys are flat out executing right now. 
Internationally, we continue to make progress with our mature field strategy. During the quarter, we completed a successful in-field drilling program in Malaysia while mobilizing for projects in Iraq and Russia. In Mexico, we completed drilling the first well using rigs from our joint venture with Trinidad Drilling, setting a new drilling record for South Mexico Mesozoic basin. We're seeing strong interest from our clients tendering new activity, and the global pipeline of opportunities that we're evaluating continues to be in excess of $35 billion.[ph] 
The deepwater economics were challenged at $100 a barrel and are clearly challenged in the current commodity price environment, which is precisely why we are focused on technology that both delivers better production and reduces the structural cost of drilling wells. This generally means removing complete activities from the work stream. A terrific example of this is how Landmark's decision space software allows clients to reduce drilling base by integrating with well construction design. And the reason Deepwater project this integration reduced drilling time by 15 days by eliminating 1 entire directional build face. 
In another case, the president of another large client was quoted at a recent conference saying that his company reduced his seismic survey data analysis time by 80% through working with Landmark. The point is that Landmark is making a meaningful contribution to our strategy to lower the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our clients by eliminating activities and reducing structural costs while also delivering more productive wells.
Another example of technology driving efficiency was the delivery of 3 lower tertiary completions in the Gulf of Mexico using our enhanced single-trip multizone Packer system. The is proving to consistently reduce rig time in these high-cost environments.
Turning to North America land. The industry saw a sharp 40% sequential decline in the average rig count during the second quarter. Against this backdrop, let me provide a few data points around Halliburton's operations in the quarter. North America revenue was down 25%. Our stage count was down less than 10%. Average profit per well increased 7% sequentially. And finally, approximately 85% of our active fleet continues to work on a ""24 hour a day"" operations. We believe these factors clearly indicate why operators prefer to work with a more reliable service provider like Halliburton for more complex completions.
So now that the rig count appears to be scraping along the bottom, what happens next? The exact timing is difficult to predict, but the previous cycles would point us to the following progression of how the story should play out as we move forward. First, activity stabilizing means that healing process can begin with respect to pricing and margins. This will then allow our input cost savings to catch up, and our efficiency programs and well solutions can begin driving margins up. Price improvement will then be a challenge until we see capacity tightening in the market. Therefore, any margin improvement will likely be the result of lowering our cost base. Restocking nominal amount of equipment during the quarter and expect to put this equipment back to work when the economics justify doing so. We currently estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of industry capacity has been idle, although our percentage stack is significantly lower. 
What's unique about this cycle is how service intensity has evolved since 2013. Over the last 2 years, average job size has essentially doubled, and at the same time, both average pump rates and pressures are also up. On the plus side, bigger jobs mean more revenues and better equipment utilization for us. The downside is we believe larger completions are taking their toll on pumping equipment. In fact, these factors point to higher equipment attrition rates for the industry. 
Now this is precisely why we continue to invest in our service efficiency strategy at Halliburton. Close to 40% of our pressure pumping fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future with a target to reach 50% by year end. Our customers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our units, and we are pleased with the progress in updating our fleet to this more cost-effective model. 
In addition, the downturn has allowed Halliburton to retool and improve our maintenance and value-engineering processes. The result is that in spite of increasing service intensity, our maintenance cost on a per-unit basis is trending down while our service quality and efficiency are the best in company history, differentiating us from our competitors. And while the market has been myopically focused on service pricing, we know that ultimately, it will be lower cost per barrel equivalent that will carry today. 
So to this end, in addition to service efficiency, we continue to deliver technology to help our customers reduce the structural cost of their wells. For example, the Illusion dissolving frac plug, which we launched in the second quarter, will ultimately eliminate the requirement for coiled tubing to plugs. The frac plug provides high-performance isolation during plug-in perf operations and functions like a normal plug, meaning it does not require any balls, baffles or any sort of special casing design. When dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open to maximize production. 
And I'm pleased to see the growing customer interest in using technology for better well placement and better perforation efficiency. An example of this is our proprietary frac insight solution, which gathers the necessary logging data but does it in a case environment, meaning it does not consume valuable rig time required by open hole solutions. In a joint study with a large customer in the Eagle Ford, frac insight data eliminated pumping of unnecessary outer zone treatments, which helped reduced stimulation costs by over 35% and significantly improved the cost per BOE equation for our customer. 
Let me spend a minute on re-frac technology in the market. We've been involved in refrac operations for decades and have executed at least twice as many as any other service provider. Although relatively small today, we believe this market has significant potential in the coming years. So why are our customers interested? Early horizontal wells were arguably under stimulated, and stages per well are up more than 30% and profit per well is up more than double since 2010. What's changed is 2 key components of technology: First is our diversion chemistry that more effectively stimulates wells, and then second is our diagnostic technology to validate those results. 
Diversion technology, like Halliburton's AccessFrac, more effectively stimulates the entire lateral through better profit placement creates greater complexity within the formation and helps mitigate well-bashing scenarios. Thus far, through our candidate selection process and design, AccessFrac contributes an average of 80% increase and estimated ultimate recovery for our refrac clients while greatly improving the predictability of results. More importantly, AccessFrac is equally effective as a solution on new wells, improving cluster efficiency and delivering 20% to 25% production increases for our customers compared to offset wells. AccessFrac is becoming a standard process for a growing portion of our clients and is delivering better production and EURs.
Our suite of fiber option diagnostic tools deployed either as a permanent installation or tubing allows us to monitor individual stage results and validate the treatment performance of our refrac solutions. This means that we can demonstrate that our diversion technology an equally critical delivery process together dramatically increase stimulated clusters along the lateral, thereby, maximizing our customers production and EUR. 
Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future. There's an opportunity to address the needs of operators to increase their production and expected ultimate recovery from the tens of thousands of unconventional wells drilled over the last several years, and we anticipate that customers will begin to dedicate a percentage of their annual spend refrac operations.
Because of our confidence in our technology and ability to lead this market, we've laid the groundwork to execute large-scale refrac operations through alternative business arrangements. To this end, we're pleased to announce that we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with Blackrock to provide a funding mechanism specifically for re frac projects, up to a $0.5 billion in capital over the next 3 years. 
We're pleased to work with a tremendous partner like Blackrock. This arrangement allows Halliburton to focus on candidate selection, execution and generating best-in-class returns while allowing Blackrock to pursue innovative opportunities with their clients. 
We've seen it before. Our customers and unconventionals are highly adaptable, and they are actively seeking the surface efficiencies, downhole technologies and business arrangements that will make the economics work. When the recovery does come, it's our belief that North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside. And when that happens, we are confident that Halliburton will be the best position to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle. 
I'd like now to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks."

Or how do you see that first step in pricing playing out given how depressed pricing is and given how much idle capacity there is? Should it normalize a little bit quicker because there's so much stack capacity deplore investing in their fleets? Or Is it going to take as long as it has also prior and up cycles?"

Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to ongoing discussions, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters.
Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website.
We have several moving pieces this quarter, so let me help you walk through the numbers. As announced in our press release, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44 excluding restructuring cost of $0.30 and acquisition-related costs of $0.08. 
However, as required by generally accepted accounting principles, included in our results was a $0.06 benefit related to the cessation of depreciation expense associated with the assets we are currently marketing in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Excluding the depreciation benefit would have resulted in earnings per share for the quarter of $0.38.
Going forward, the benefit associated with our assets held for sale should be factored into your financial models as this is the only quarter that we intend to disclose it separately.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave."

The services industry obviously experienced another challenging quarter with lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressures across the globe as our customers continued to respond to the impact of red",1372,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. The services industry obviously experienced another challenging quarter with lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressures across the globe as our customers continued to respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices. Considering the difficult headwinds that worked against us, I am very pleased with our overall financial results for the second quarter.
Now let me cover some headlines. First, total company revenue of $5.9 billion declined 16% sequentially compared to a 26% decline in the worldwide rig count. I'm also very pleased with our Eastern Hemisphere margin expansion, which, once again, outpaced our primary competitor. We generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. Operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels, exacerbated by pricing declines primarily in North America.
Revenue for North America was down 25% sequentially, significantly outperforming the 40% decline in the average rig count. And while the North American rig count declined 40%, our stage count declined less than 10%. Therefore, we believe that a customer flight to quality emerged during the quarter and this gives us reason to believe that pricing declines may begin to decelerate. And I can tell you our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable in this market. And although we experienced some weather disruptions, we were able to make up this work later in the quarter.
We continue to maintain an infrastructure well beyond current market needs ahead of the Baker transaction, incurring costs which we would have otherwise eliminated. This impacted margins by 300 to 400 basis points in Q2. And decremental margins this quarter were better than previous cycles, which demonstrates that our aggressive cost-reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. 
The U.S. rig count finished the quarter down 55% from the peak in late November that has moved sideways over the last few weeks. Price erosion continued in the second quarter and is likely to remain fluid in the near term. We anticipate margin compression in the third quarter, but believe it will be driven more by the full impact of pricing declines that we gave up in the second quarter and from lower activity levels more than continued price erosion. In fact, we believe that service pricing for the industry has fallen to unsustainable levels. Last quarter, we described 3 types of service companies in the market: those making a profit, which weren't very many; those covering cash costs; and those operating at a loss even on a cash basis. 
During the first quarter, Halliburton was one of just a few companies that posted profits in North America, and we expect the second quarter has been even more challenging for those of us in the industry. As a result, we believe many of the smaller service companies are now operating below cash break-even levels, which leads to the conclusion that pricing cannot stay at these levels for an extended period.
Now looking ahead, we could begin to see a modest uptick in activity during the second half of this year, which could include increased refract activity, which Jeff Miller will detail later. However, we are not expecting a meaningful activity increase until sometime in 2016 depending on the pace of production declines and where commodity prices settle out in the coming quarters. Therefore, what we are continuing to do is manage our costs, service our customers that are engaged in this flight to quality and prepare for the Baker transaction.
Now outside North America, I'm very happy with where our international business is today. Our full year outlook for our international businesses remains unchanged. We still estimate a mid-teens decline in total international customer spend compared to last year. However, we expect to outpace the total market and believe our revenue decline will be less severe. We also anticipate our third quarter Eastern Hemisphere margins will be in the upper teens.
Now let me provide a little bit of international and regional color. In the Middle East/Asia, we see a solid and stable business as project awards across the Middle East are moving forward. Europe/Africa/CIS is challenged today with the North Sea, Russia and Angola markets being the most vulnerable. And in Latin America, operators are struggling with their cash flows. 
Although the international markets are more resilient than North America, they are certainly not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. We did experience some pricing declines in the first half of the year, but negotiations are continuing and we will not see lower pricing fully built into our run rate until the second half of the year. In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. 
The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same: we are continuing to employ a two-pronged approach. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. To do this, we continue to invest in key technologies, build out capital equipment and prepare for our pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. 
The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn, drawing upon our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input costs, eliminating discretionary spending, managing our business within our cash flows and protecting our market position.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the significant progress we are making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. During the quarter, we began marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. In early July, we received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses, all of which included prices, and we are very pleased with the prices and their response. Because of the high level of interest we received, we are limiting the number of bidders for the second round to only the strongest responses. We expect to complete the auction process sometime this fall with the closing of the divestitures being concurrent with the closing of the larger transaction. 
We have also recently provided a proposal for additional divestitures to various competition authorities around the world. In aggregate, the total divestitures being considered are still within the scope of those contemplated by us at the time that we announced the transaction. 
On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ. Timing agreements are often entered into in connection with large, complex transactions and provide the DOJ additional time to review responses to its second request. We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DOJ's second request. I am pleased to say that Baker Hughes did certify substantial compliance on July 14 and we expect to do so shortly. 
Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings in foreign jurisdictions. Specific to the European Union, we expect to submit our filings later this month, which will start the formal review process. 
We are fully committed to our target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement does provide that closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary.
As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion regardless of market conditions or any cost-reduction actions taken by either company to that date. 
In closing, we are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil services company, combining our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.
Now let me turn the call back over to Christian who will provide you some details on our financial results. Christian?"

During the second quarter, we announced our decision to divest our Drill Bits and Drilling, MWD/LWD businesses. These businesses were classified as assets held for sale in the second quarter and we seized the associated depreciation and amortization for these assets, resulting in an approximate $0.06 benefit to the quarter. We've included a table in our earnings release quantifying the second quarter profit uplift by geography. 
To provide better transparency of our current operational trends, the sequential comparisons in my comments today have been adjusted to exclude the special items indicated in our earnings release as well as the benefit of the lower depreciation, meaning both the first and second quarter results reflect the full depreciation burden in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison.
Now let me provide a comparison of our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.9 billion represented a 16% decline while operating income declined 18% to $570 million. North America led the decline as a result of lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure across all of our product lines.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, second quarter revenue declined by 3% while operating income increased 17%, representing a 300 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter levels despite activity and pricing headwinds.
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% while operating income showed a modest improvement. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were offset by improved profitability in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. We are pleased with the progress of operations in Iraq where margins reached double digits for the first time, which we expect to sustain for the full year.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw second quarter revenue come in flat with operating income increasing by 69%. Seasonal activity improvements in Eurasia and Norway, along with higher stimulation activity in Completion Tools sales in both Algeria and Angola, drove the improvement for the quarter offsetting weaker activity levels in the U.K. and Egypt. 
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 19% and 21%, respectively, driven by Venezuela primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate. Partially offsetting this decline was improved profitability in Brazil, resulting from the recently retendered Directional Drilling contract. 
Moving to North America. Revenue and operating income declined 25% and 59%, respectively, relative to a 40% reduction in the North America rig count. Lower customer budgets translated into additional reductions in activity levels throughout the second quarter, accompanied by further significant price reductions across all product lines. Our decrementals in the second quarter were 19%, about half of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2009.
During the second quarter, we took additional actions to adjust the cost structure due to the continued decline in the global activity levels. As a result, we incurred in additional after-tax restructuring charge of $258 million in the second quarter consisting primarily of severance-related costs and asset write-offs. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have now reduced our global headcount by over 16%. We continue to evaluate our operations and we'll make further adjustments as required to adjust to market conditions. 
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the third quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the remainder of 2015.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 26% and is expected to be between 26% and 27% for the remainder of the year.
We continue to focus on cash flow generation, and given the continued decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital spend for the year by another $200 million to $2.6 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our third quarter operations outlook. My guidance commentary will include the benefit of our lower depreciation and amortization run rate from assets held for sale. 
Starting with the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. We expect to see a full quarter impact of price reductions, which will affect our third quarter results. We currently expect a low to mid-single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins declining modestly into the upper teens. 
For Latin America, we also anticipate a modest decline in the third quarter for both revenues and margins.
In North America, if we extrapolate the current rig count forward, it suggests that the average rig count for the third quarter should decline by at least 5% compared to the prior quarter. This, in combination with a full quarter impact of lower pricing, leads us to believe that revenues and margins in the third quarter will be under pressure. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles where we typically see at least a 1-quarter lag when the market is transitioning towards the bottom. Based on our visibility today, we're currently expecting a low single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins also drifting modestly lower.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company and our guys are flat out executing right now. 
Internationally, we continue to make progress with our mature field strategy. During the quarter, we completed a successful in-field drilling program in Malaysia while mobilizing for projects in Iraq and Russia. In Mexico, we completed drilling the first well using rigs from our joint venture with Trinidad Drilling, setting a new drilling record for South Mexico Mesozoic basin. We're seeing strong interests from our clients tendering new activity, and the global pipeline of opportunities that we're evaluating continues to be in excess of $35 billion.
The deepwater economics were challenged at $100 a barrel and are clearly challenged in the current commodity price environment, which is precisely why we are focused on technology that both delivers better production and reduces the structural costs of drilling wells. This generally means removing complete activities from the work stream. A terrific example of this is how Landmark's DecisionSpace software allows clients to reduce drilling days by integrating geological data with well construction design. In a recent deepwater project, this integration reduced drilling time by 15 days by eliminating 1 entire directional build phase. In another case, the president of another large client was quoted at a recent conference saying that his company reduced his seismic survey data analysis time by 80% through working with Landmark. The point is that Landmark is making a meaningful contribution to our strategy to lower the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our clients by eliminating activities and reducing structural costs while also delivering more productive wells.
Another example of technology driving efficiency was the delivery of 3 Lower Tertiary completions in the Gulf of Mexico using our Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone packer system. The ESTMZ is proving to consistently reduce rig time in these high-cost environments.
Turning to North America land. The industry saw a sharp 40% sequential decline in the average rig count during the second quarter. Against this backdrop, let me provide a few data points around Halliburton's operations in the quarter. North America revenue was down 25%. Our stage count was down less than 10%. Average profit per well increased 7% sequentially. And finally, approximately 85% of our active fleet continues to work on a ""24 hour a day"" operations. We believe these factors clearly indicate why operators prefer to work with a more reliable service provider like Halliburton for more complex completions.
So now that the rig count appears to be scraping along the bottom, what happens next? The exact timing is difficult to predict, but the previous cycles would point us to the following progression of how the story should play out as we move forward. First, activity stabilizing means the healing process can begin with respect to pricing and margins. This will then allow our input cost savings to catch up and our efficiency programs and well solutions can begin driving margins up. Price improvement will then be a challenge until we see capacity tightening in the market. Therefore, any margin improvement will likely be the result of lowering our cost base, restacking nominal amount of equipment during the quarter and expect to put this equipment back to work when the economics justify doing so. We currently estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of industry capacity has been idled, although our percentage stack is significantly lower. 
What's unique about this cycle is how service intensity has evolved since 2013. Over the last 2 years, average job size has essentially doubled, and at the same time, both average pump rates and pressures are also up. On the plus side, bigger jobs mean more revenues and better equipment utilization for us. The downside is we believe that larger completions are taking their toll on pumping equipment. In fact, these factors point to higher equipment attrition rates for the industry. 
Now this is precisely why we continue to invest in our service efficiency strategy at Halliburton. Close to 40% of our pressure pumping fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future with a target to reach 50% by year-end. Our customers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our Q10 units and we are pleased with the progress in updating our fleet to this more cost-effective model. 
In addition, the downturn has allowed Halliburton to retool and improve our maintenance and value-engineering processes. The result is that in spite of increasing service intensity, our maintenance cost on a per-unit basis is trending down while our service quality and efficiency are the best in company history, differentiating us from our competitors. And while the market has been myopically focused on service pricing, we know that, ultimately, it will be lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent that will carry the day. 
So to this end, in addition to service efficiency, we continue to deliver technology to help our customers reduce the structural cost of their wells. For example, the Illusion dissolving frac plug, which we launched in the second quarter, will ultimately eliminate the requirement for coiled tubing to mill out plugs. The Illusion frac plug provides high-performance isolation during plug-and-perf operations and functions like a normal plug, meaning it does not require any balls, baffles or any sort of special casing design. When dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open to maximize production. 
And I'm pleased to see the growing customer interest in using technology for better well placement and better perforation efficiency. An example of this is our proprietary FRACINSIGHT solution, which gathers the necessary logging data but does it in a cased-hole environment, meaning it does not consume valuable rig time required by open-hole solutions. In a joint study with a large customer in the Eagle Ford, FRACINSIGHT data eliminated the pumping of unnecessary out-of-zone treatments, which helped reduce stimulation costs by over 35% and significantly improved the cost per BOE equation for our customer. 
Let me spend a minute on refrac technology in the market. We've been involved in refrac operations for decades and have executed at least twice as many as any other service provider. Although relatively small today, we believe this market has significant potential in the coming years. 
So why are customers interested? Early horizontal wells were arguably under-stimulated and stages per well are up more than 30% and profit per well is up more than double since 2010. What's changed is 2 key components of technology: first is our diversion chemistry that more effectively stimulates wells; and then second is our diagnostic technology to validate those results. 
Diversion technology, like Halliburton's AccessFrac, more effectively stimulates the entire lateral through better proppant placement, creates greater complexity within the formation and helps mitigate well-bashing scenarios. Thus far, through our candidate selection process and design, AccessFrac contributes an average of 80% increase and estimated ultimate recovery for our refrac clients while greatly improving the predictability of results. More importantly, AccessFrac is equally effective as a solution on new wells, improving cluster efficiency and delivering 20% to 25% production increases for our customers compared to offset wells. AccessFrac is becoming a standard process for a growing portion of our clients and is delivering better production and EURs.
Our suite of fiber-optic diagnostic tools deployed either as a permanent installation or on coiled tubing allows us to monitor individual stage results and validate the treatment performance of our refrac solutions. This means that we can demonstrate that our diversion technology, an equally critical delivery process, together, dramatically increase stimulated clusters along the lateral, thereby maximizing our customer's production and EUR. 
Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future. There's an opportunity to address the needs of operators to increase their production and expected ultimate recovery from the tens of thousands of unconventional wells drilled over the last several years, and we anticipate that customers will begin to dedicate a percentage of their annual spend to refracturing operations.
Because of our confidence in our technology and ability to lead this market, we've laid the groundwork to execute large-scale refrac operations through alternative business arrangements. To this end, we're pleased to announce that we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with BlackRock to provide a funding mechanism specifically for refrac projects, up to a $0.5 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We're pleased to work with a tremendous partner like BlackRock. This arrangement allows Halliburton to focus on candidate selection, execution and generating best-in-class returns while allowing BlackRock to pursue innovative opportunities with their clients. 
We've seen it before. Our customers in unconventionals are highly adaptable and they're actively seeking the surface efficiencies, downhole technologies and business arrangements that will make the economics work. When the recovery does come, it's our belief that North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside. And when that happens, we are confident that Halliburton will be the best position to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle. 
I'd like now to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks."

As we have said, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable and we are already seeing that by working together, we can figure out a way to have both of us earn returns for our shareholders even in this challenged commodity market.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to ongoing discussions, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website.
We have several moving pieces this quarter, so let me help you walk through the numbers. As announced in our press release, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44 excluding restructuring cost of $0.30 and acquisition-related cost of $0.08. However, as required by generally accepted accounting principles, included in our results was a $0.06 benefit related to the cessation of depreciation expense associated with the assets we are currently marketing in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Excluding the depreciation benefit would have resulted in earnings per share for the quarter of $0.38. Going forward, the benefit associated with our assets held for sale should be factored into your financial models as this is the only quarter that we intend to disclose it separately.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave."

The services industry obviously experienced another challenging quarter with lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressures across the globe as our customers continue to respond to the impact of redu",1371,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. The services industry obviously experienced another challenging quarter with lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressures across the globe as our customers continue to respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices. Considering the difficult headwinds that worked against us, I am very pleased with our overall financial results for the second quarter.
Now let me cover some headlines. First, total company revenue of $5.9 billion declined 16% sequentially compared to a 26% decline in the worldwide rig count. I'm also very pleased with our Eastern Hemisphere margin expansion, which, once again, outpaced our primary competitor. We generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. Operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels, exacerbated by pricing declines primarily in North America.
Revenue for North America was down 25% sequentially, significantly outperforming the 40% decline in the average rig count. And while the North American rig count declined 40%, our stage count declined less than 10%. Therefore, we believe that a customer flight to quality emerged during the quarter and this gives us reason to believe that pricing declines may begin to decelerate. And I can tell you our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable in this market. And although we experienced some weather disruptions, we were able to make up this work later in the quarter. We continue to maintain an infrastructure well beyond current market needs ahead of the Baker transaction, incurring costs which we would have otherwise eliminated. This impacted margins by 300 to 400 basis points in Q2. And decremental margins this quarter were better than previous cycles, which demonstrates that our aggressive cost-reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. 
The U.S. rig count finished the quarter down 55% from the peak in late November, but has moved sideways over the last few weeks. Price erosion continued in the second quarter and is likely to remain fluid in the near term. We anticipate margin compression in the third quarter, but believe it will be driven more by the full impact of pricing declines that we gave up in the second quarter and from lower activity levels more than continued price erosion. In fact, we believe that service pricing for the industry has fallen to unsustainable levels. Last quarter, we described 3 types of service companies in the market: those making a profit, which weren't very many; those covering cash costs; and those operating at a loss even on a cash basis. 
During the first quarter, Halliburton was one of just a few companies that posted profits in North America, and we expect the second quarter has been even more challenging for those of us in the industry. As a result, we believe many of the smaller service companies are now operating below cash breakeven levels, which leads to the conclusion that pricing cannot stay at these levels for an extended period.
Now looking ahead, we could begin to see a modest uptick in activity during the second half of this year, which could include increased refrac activity, which Jeff Miller will detail later. However, we are not expecting a meaningful activity increase until sometime in 2016, depending on the pace of production declines and where commodity prices settle out in the coming quarters. Therefore, what we are continuing to do is manage our costs, service our customers that are engaged in this flight to quality and prepare for the Baker transaction.
Now outside North America, I'm very happy with where our international business is today. Our full year outlook for our international businesses remains unchanged. We still estimate a mid-teens decline in total international customer spend compared to last year. However, we expect to outpace the total market and believe our revenue decline will be less severe. We also anticipate our third quarter Eastern Hemisphere margins will be in the upper teens.
Now let me provide a little bit of international regional color. In the Middle East/Asia, we see a solid and stable business as project awards across the Middle East are moving forward. Europe/Africa/CIS is challenged today with the North Sea, Russia and Angola markets being the most vulnerable. And in Latin America, operators are struggling with their cash flows. Although the international markets are more resilient than North America, they are certainly not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. We did experience some pricing declines in the first half of the year, but negotiations are continuing and we will not see lower pricing fully built into our run rate until the second half of the year. In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. 
The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same: we are continuing to employ a two-pronged approach. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. To do this, we continue to invest in key technologies, build out capital equipment and prepare for our pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn, drawing upon our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input costs, eliminating discretionary spending, managing our business within our cash flows and protecting our market position.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the significant progress we are making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. During the quarter, we began marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. In early July, we received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses, all of which included prices, and we are very pleased with the prices and their response. Because of the high level of interest we received, we are limiting the number of bidders for the second round to only the strongest responses. We expect to complete the auction process sometime this fall, with the closing of the divestitures being concurrent with the closing of the larger transaction. We have also recently provided a proposal for additional divestitures to various competition authorities around the world. In aggregate, the total divestitures being considered are still within the scope of those contemplated by us at the time that we announced the transaction. 
On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ. Timing agreements are often entered into in connection with large, complex transactions and provide the DOJ additional time to review responses to its second request. We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DOJ's second request. I am pleased to say that Baker Hughes did certify substantial compliance on July 14 and we expect to do so shortly. 
Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings in foreign jurisdictions. Specific to the European Union, we expect to submit our filings later this month, which will start the formal review process. We are fully committed to our target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement does provide that closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion regardless of market conditions or any cost-reduction actions taken by either company to that date. 
In closing, we are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil services company, combining our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.
Now let me turn the call back over to Christian who will provide you some details on our financial results. Christian?"
177698,298618827,834664,"Halliburton Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.

During the second quarter, we announced our decision to divest our Drill Bits and Drilling, MWD/LWD businesses. These businesses were classified as assets held for sale in the second quarter and we seized the associated depreciation and amortization for these assets, resulting in an approximate $0.06 benefit to the quarter. We've included a table in our earnings release quantifying the second quarter profit uplift by geography. 
To provide better transparency of our current operational trends, the sequential comparisons in my comments today have been adjusted to exclude the special items indicated in our earnings release as well as the benefit of the lower depreciation, meaning both the first and second quarter results reflect the full depreciation burden in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison.
Now let me provide a comparison of our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.9 billion represented a 16% decline while operating income declined 18% to $570 million. North America led the decline as a result of lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure across all of our product lines. In the Eastern Hemisphere, second quarter revenue declined by 3% while operating income increased 17%, representing a 300 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter levels despite activity and pricing headwinds.
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% while operating income showed a modest improvement. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were offset by improved profitability in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. We are pleased with the progress of operations in Iraq where margins reached double digits for the first time, which we expect to sustain for the full year.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw second quarter revenue come in flat with operating income increasing by 69%. Seasonal activity improvements in Eurasia and Norway, along with higher stimulation activity in Completion Tools sales in both Algeria and Angola, drove the improvement for the quarter offsetting weaker activity levels in the U.K. and Egypt.  Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 19% and 21%, respectively, driven by Venezuela primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate. Partially offsetting this decline was improved profitability in Brazil, resulting from the recently retendered Directional Drilling contract. 
Moving to North America. Revenue and operating income declined 25% and 59%, respectively, relative to a 40% reduction in the North America rig count. Lower customer budgets translated into additional reductions in activity levels throughout the second quarter, accompanied by further significant price reductions across all product lines. Our decrementals in the second quarter were 19%, about half of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2009. 
During the second quarter, we took additional actions to adjust our cost structure due to the continued decline in the global activity levels. As a result, we incurred in additional after-tax restructuring charge of $258 million in the second quarter consisting primarily of severance-related costs and asset write-offs. Since the beginning of the year, we have now reduced our global headcount by over 16%. We continue to evaluate our operations and we'll make further adjustments as required to adjust to market conditions. 
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the third quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the remainder of 2015. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 26% and is expected to be between 26% and 27% for the remainder of the year. We continue to focus on cash flow generation, and given the continued decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital spend for the year by another $200 million to $2.6 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our third quarter operations outlook. My guidance commentary will include the benefit of our lower depreciation and amortization run rate from assets held for sale.  Starting with the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. We expect to see a full quarter impact of price reductions, which will affect our third quarter results. We currently expect a low to mid-single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins declining modestly into the upper teens.  For Latin America, we also anticipate a modest decline in the third quarter for both revenues and margins.
In North America, if we extrapolate the current rig count forward, it suggests that the average rig count for the third quarter should decline by at least 5% compared to the prior quarter. This, in combination with a full quarter impact of lower pricing, leads us to believe that revenues and margins in the third quarter will be under pressure. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles where we typically see at least a 1-quarter lag when the market is transitioning towards the bottom. Based on our visibility today, we're currently expecting a low single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins also drifting modestly lower.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,298618827,834664,"Halliburton Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2015",2015-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Christian, and good morning. I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company and our guys are flat out executing right no",1526,"Thanks, Christian, and good morning. I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company and our guys are flat out executing right now. 
Internationally, we continue to make progress with our mature field strategy. During the quarter, we completed a successful in-field drilling program in Malaysia while mobilizing for projects in Iraq and Russia. In Mexico, we completed drilling the first well using rigs from our joint venture with Trinidad Drilling, setting a new drilling record for South Mexico Mesozoic basin. We're seeing strong interests from our clients tendering new activity, and the global pipeline of opportunities that we're evaluating continues to be in excess of $35 billion.
The deepwater economics were challenged at $100 a barrel and are clearly challenged in the current commodity price environment, which is precisely why we are focused on technology that both delivers better production and reduces the structural cost of drilling wells. This generally means removing complete activities from the work stream. A terrific example of this is how Landmark's DecisionSpace software allows clients to reduce drilling days by integrating geological data with well construction design. In a recent deepwater project, this integration reduced drilling time by 15 days by eliminating 1 entire directional build phase. In another case, the president of another large client was quoted at a recent conference saying that his company reduced its seismic survey data analysis time by 80% through working with Landmark. The point is that Landmark is making a meaningful contribution to our strategy to lower the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our clients by eliminating activities and reducing structural costs while also delivering more productive wells. Another example of technology driving efficiency was the delivery of 3 Lower Tertiary completions in the Gulf of Mexico using our Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone packer system. The ESTMZ is proving to consistently reduce rig time in these high-cost environments.
Turning to North America land. The industry saw a sharp 40% sequential decline in the average rig count during the second quarter. Against this backdrop, let me provide a few data points around Halliburton's operations in the quarter. North America revenue was down 25%. Our stage count was down less than 10%. Average profit per well increased 7% sequentially. And finally, approximately 85% of our active fleet continues to work on a ""24 hour a day"" operations. We believe these factors clearly indicate why operators prefer to work with a more reliable service provider like Halliburton for more complex completions.
So now that the rig count appears to be scraping along the bottom, what happens next? The exact timing is difficult to predict, but the previous cycles would point us to the following progression of how the story should play out as we move forward. First, activity stabilizing means the healing process can begin with respect to pricing and margins. This will then allow our input cost savings to catch up and our efficiency programs and well solutions can begin driving margins up. Price improvement will then be a challenge until we see capacity tightening in the market. Therefore, any margin improvement will likely be the result of lowering our cost base. We stacked a nominal amount of equipment during the quarter and expect to put this equipment back to work when the economics justify doing so. We currently estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of industry capacity has been idled, although our percentage stacked is significantly lower. 
What's unique about this cycle is how service intensity has evolved since 2013. Over the last 2 years, average job size has essentially doubled, and at the same time, both average pump rates and pressures are also up. On the plus side, bigger jobs mean more revenues and better equipment utilization for us. The downside is we believe larger completions are taking their toll on pumping equipment. In fact, these factors point to higher equipment attrition rates for the industry. Now this is precisely why we continue to invest in our service efficiency strategy at Halliburton. Close to 40% of our pressure pumping fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future with a target to reach 50% by year-end. Our customers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our Q10 units and we are pleased with the progress in updating our fleet to this more cost-effective model. 
In addition, the downturn has allowed Halliburton to retool and improve our maintenance and value-engineering processes. The result is that in spite of increasing service intensity, our maintenance cost on a per-unit basis is trending down while our service quality and efficiency are the best in company history, differentiating us from our competitors. And while the market has been myopically focused on service pricing, we know that, ultimately, it will be lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent that will carry the day. 
So to this end, in addition to service efficiency, we continue to deliver technology to help our customers reduce the structural cost of their wells. For example, the Illusion dissolving frac plug, which we launched in the second quarter, will ultimately eliminate the requirement for coiled tubing to mill out plugs. The Illusion frac plug provides high-performance isolation during plug-and-perf operations and functions like a normal plug, meaning it does not require any balls, baffles or any sort of special casing design. When dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open to maximize production. 
And I'm pleased to see the growing customer interest in using technology for better well placement and better perforation efficiency. An example of this is our proprietary FRACINSIGHT solution, which gathers the necessary logging data but does it in a cased-hole environment, meaning it does not consume valuable rig time required by open-hole solutions. In a joint study with a large customer in the Eagle Ford, FRACINSIGHT data eliminated pumping of unnecessary out-of-zone treatments, which helped reduce stimulation costs by over 35% and significantly improved the cost per BOE equation for our customer. 
Let me spend a minute on refrac technology in the market. We've been involved in refrac operations for decades and have executed at least twice as many as any other service provider. Although relatively small today, we believe this market has significant potential in the coming years. So why are customers interested? Early horizontal wells were arguably under-stimulated and stages per well are up more than 30% and profit per well is up more than double since 2010. What's changed is 2 key components of technology: first is our diversion chemistry that more effectively stimulates wells; and then second is our diagnostic technology to validate those results. 
Diversion technology, like Halliburton's AccessFrac, more effectively stimulates the entire lateral through better proppant placement, creates greater complexity within the formation and helps mitigate well-bashing scenarios. Thus far, through our candidate selection process and design, AccessFrac contributes an average of 80% increase in estimated ultimate recovery for our refrac clients while greatly improving the predictability of results. More importantly, AccessFrac is equally effective as a solution on new wells, improving cluster efficiency and delivering 20% to 25% production increases for our customers compared to offset wells. AccessFrac is becoming a standard process for a growing portion of our clients and is delivering better production and EURs.
Our suite of fiber-optic diagnostic tools deployed either as a permanent installation or on coiled tubing allows us to monitor individual stage results and validate the treatment performance of our refrac solutions. This means that we can demonstrate that our diversion technology, an equally critical delivery process, together, dramatically increase stimulated clusters along the lateral, thereby maximizing our customer's production and EUR.  Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future. There's an opportunity to address the needs of operators to increase their production and expected ultimate recovery from the tens of thousands of unconventional wells drilled over the last several years, and we anticipate that customers will begin to dedicate a percentage of their annual spend to refracturing operations.
Because of our confidence in our technology and ability to lead this market, we've laid the groundwork to execute large-scale refrac operations through alternative business arrangements. To this end, we're pleased to announce that we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with BlackRock to provide a funding mechanism specifically for refrac projects, up to $0.5 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We're pleased to work with a tremendous partner like BlackRock. This arrangement allows Halliburton to focus on candidate selection, execution and generating best-in-class returns while allowing BlackRock to pursue innovative opportunities with their clients. 
We've seen it before. Our customers in unconventionals are highly adaptable and they're actively seeking the surface efficiencies, downhole technologies and business arrangements that will make the economics work. When the recovery does come, it's our belief that North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside. And when that happens, we are confident that Halliburton will be the best positioned to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle. 
I'd like now to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks."

As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity price",1196,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices and the pressure that their own shareholders are putting on them. Considering the difficult headwinds that were working against us, I'm actually very pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter, especially for our Eastern Hemisphere operations.
Now let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially, outperforming our largest peer. I'm very pleased with the resilience of our international business where we again outperformed our largest peer on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for both revenue and margins.  This demonstrates once again that we are not getting distracted as we go through the merger process, and I am confident that from what we are seeing in the marketplace, this is the same for Baker Hughes. And despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to maintain operating margins due to a relentless focus on cost management.
As expected, North America revenue and operating income declined further as a result of lower activity levels and pricing pressure. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the peak that we saw last November, our completions-related activity has declined approximately 18% relative to a 58% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn, and it positions us well for when the market recovers.
And finally, we took an additional restructuring charge to reflect current market conditions, so let me remind you as we approach the finish line on the Baker Hughes acquisition, we continue to maintain North American infrastructure well beyond current market needs, incurring a cost which we would have otherwise eliminated. This cost impacted North America margins by approximately 400 basis points in the third quarter.
Now turning to operations. In North America, prices continued to erode during the third quarter, impacting the total services industry profitability, obviously including ourselves. We believe these prices are clearly unsustainable, but as we have been saying all along, pricing cannot stabilize until activity stabilizes. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, visibility is murky at best. Based on current feedback, we believe most operators have exhausted their 2015 budgets and will take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving, therefore, activity levels could drop substantially in the last 5 weeks of the year. In my 22 years in this business, I've never seen a market where we've had less near-term visibility. In reality, we are managing this business on a near-realtime basis, customer by customer, district by district, product line by product line and yes, even crew by crew, but you know me and you know our management team. Nobody knows the North America land market better than us. We are the execution company, and we know what levers to pull to make this market work. 
Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post-Thanksgiving, we expect to see a slower ramp-up beginning in January and improving from their, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle. 
If you pull back and look at the full year 2016 and compare it to 2015, you could envision a similar mirror image, directionally a slow start and then perhaps picking up speed in the second half of the year. Now there obviously are a number of moving parts in North America, but I'm not confident enough yet to call the exact shape of this recovery, but we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. Until then, we will continue to execute on our strategy, and we will be watching the same external data points that you do: what is happening to oil production, what is the rig count doing, what is happening with operators' cash flows and how are redeterminations impacting our customers credit lines. And in addition, we have our own proprietary internal metrics that we will follow. 
We will continue to adjust our cost structure to market conditions. But to me, it does not make sense to reduce cost or infrastructure to reflect expected fourth quarter's reduced activity levels. Instead, we are positioning our North America land business for future success and to ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers. 
Internationally, I remain very happy with where our business is today. The international markets have held up better than North America, but they are not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. We did experience lower prices during the quarter but in anticipation of these reductions, we aggressively went after further cost adjustments. And although we had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency.
Internationally for 2016, we expect to see a continuation of trends of 2015. Land-based activity, including mature fields, should be the most resilient, while we expect offshore to see additional project delays.
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced the second tranche of businesses to be marketed for sale in connection with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and we expect that marketing process to begin shortly. On the first tranche of divestitures, we have now moved into the negotiation process. On the regulatory front, during the quarter, the timing agreement with the DOJ was extended by 3 weeks. And accordingly, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to extend the closing date to December 16. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with completing the required filings and obtaining the necessary approvals. Specific to the European Commission, we are working cooperatively to respond to their information request and expect to resubmit our filing in the near future, which will start the formal review process. Let me be very clear. We remain confident this deal will be approved. We continue to target the 2015 close, but the transaction could move into 2016, which is allowed under the merger agreement. We are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction and achieving our annual cost synergy targets of nearly $2 billion. I want to be clear this $2 billion will be on top of any cost reductions that we've made to date. We're very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders from both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bell weather global oil field services company combining our highly complementary suites of services and products into our comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"

Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to $506 million. North America led the decline as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, third quarter revenue declined by 5%, while operating income margins remained unchanged to second quarter levels. The impact of price negotiations with our customers in the first half has been offset primarily by a proactive reduction in operational costs. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 4% with a similar decline in operating income of 3%. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were partially offset by increased activity in the UAE and Iraq.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw our third quarter revenue declined by 7% with a decrease in operating income of 9%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower activity in Angola and East Africa. Latin America revenue and operating income both declined 4% during the quarter, driven primarily by reduced activity in Mexico. Partially offsetting this decline was improved unconventional activity levels in Argentina. 
Moving to North America, revenue declined 7% with operating income at near breakeven levels. Reduced activity levels throughout U.S. land were accompanied by further price reductions across the business, especially in the pumping-related product lines.
Globally, the continued activity declines and pricing pressures led us to take additional actions to adjust our cost structure. As a result, we incurred an additional restructuring charge of $257 million after tax in the third quarter, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As this market plays out, we will evaluate our operations and make further adjustments as required.
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $58 million for the quarter, and we estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $65 million.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in a bit higher at 29% due to the impact of gains from our foreign currency hedging program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance by an additional $200 million to $2.4 billion for the year. This represents a 27% year-over-year decline. However, our Q10 program remains intact as we derive significant cost savings from its deployment, and the Q10 provides us the ability to adjust the higher completions intensity experienced by the industry.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our operations outlook, starting with our international business. We believe that typical seasonal uptick in year-end sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat to modestly lower compared to the third quarter. 
In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators and a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict. So far, the average horizontal rig count is down a little less than 10% from the third quarter average. If these headwinds play out, we estimate that the fourth quarter average horizontal rig count could drop about 15% to 20% sequentially. We expect our North America revenues and margins to decline, but we anticipate sequential decrementals to be only in the mid-teens due to our cost-reduction efforts.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

To begin, I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our operational teams for once again executing to our playbook. I'm telling you we are not distracted. I particularly like the recognizable performance of our international employees focused on our market in a very difficult market. Now what's on everyone's mind is North America, so let me give you a little more granularity on North America by division. Our drilling-related businesses have been much more resilient than our completions-related businesses. In fact, drilling division margins increased this quarter to 10%, and this is including the 400 basis point impact of the added cost that we're carrying in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Obviously, the most stressed part of our business is pumping. Now this is a business that we know the best. This is the business that recovers the fastest, it's the business that recovers the most sharply, and we know what that path looks like. It looks like this. It looks like staying with the fairway cleaners and the basins that we know, it does not mean chasing every stake. It looks like staying with the customers that are loyal even if that means working at the price that we don't like elaborating on a path forward that lowers our cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and it looks like staying with the overall strategy to focus on long-term returns, meaning we see a path to profitability. This is a very simple solution. But simple does not mean easy. So if you're looking for a silver lining year, the most competitive piece of the business, pumping, is the one that we know the best. It's the business that recovers the fastest and the most sharply, and you can be confident that we have the team that gets it done. 
The last time we reported earnings, oil was in the upper 50s, and the outlook was cautiously optimistic. Since then, we saw oil dropped into the 30s, which I can tell you immediate and visceral reaction from our customer base, and as I described in the conference during the quarter, the rig count followed the oil price down soon thereafter. Now this has caused us to continue to look carefully and strategically at the business and how we're structured to execute. In the short term, we further adjusted our operations. Recent actions we've taken include partnering with our suppliers to find better ways to work together in these tougher times, leveraging our logistics infrastructure including higher rate usage of unit trains and staffing additional equipment during the quarter where we've been unable to make an acceptable return or cannot see a path to acceptable returns and finally, rightsizing the business to reflect current activity levels. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the year, market conditions have forced us to reduce our global headcount by over 21%. Now these are always tough decisions affecting great people, but they are simply decisions that we have to make. Consistent with maintaining our service delivery model to obtain the cost synergy savings in the Baker acquisition, we've taken a bottoms-up look at our service process, including comparing our current structure to previous similarly sized markets. This is an examination of how we work. Those things absolutely required to deliver our value proposition, which also means stripping away everything that is not required. For example, in the third quarter, we eliminated an entire level of management in North America. In my view, this is not a onetime initiative. By clarifying and controlling how we execute, we can retain this efficiency, these cost savings as the market recovers. We have a two-pronged strategy. The first part being to control who we control in the short term, and the second is looking beyond the cycle and preparing for the recovery. Q10's are a great example. The cost savings we derived from these new generation fleets are substantial compared to legacy equipment: 25% less capital on location, 30% less labor on-site and up to 50% less maintenance cost. Q10 spreads now represent close to 50% of our fleet, and we should be near 60% by the end of the year. At the same time, those legacy assets that are still deployed are being strategically placed to maximize our potential in locations or functions that maximize their cost effectiveness. While the industry is seeing average fleet sizes increase by 15% to 20% over the last 2 [ph] years due to rising completions' intensity, our average fleet size has been essentially flat as a result of the more efficiently Q10s. So when coupled with our logistics platform, we believe Halliburton offers the lowest total cost of service to our customers at any point in the cycle. We're pleased with our customer portfolio. Both in North America and on an international basis, we've aligned with customers who have strong balance sheet and assets in the fairway positions in the basins. These are the customers that have better well economics and are continuing to work through the downturn and are engaged in the important cost per barrel discussions. Improving a customer's cost per barrel of oil equivalent is core to our value proposition. This is why we continue to invest in technology and our emphasis is on 2 basic tenets. One is increasing reliability, eliminating moving parts, simplifying designs and helping eliminate nonproductive time at the well site. The second is making better wells. Products like AccessFrac, CoreVault and DecisionSpace help customers identify and assess the sweet spots of the reservoirs and more importantly, these products have seen increased uptake during this downturn. Adoption of DecisionSpace is up double digits from 2014, for example, and the usage of AccessFrac has grown more than 60% over last year. There is no question that this is a challenging market today, but our playbook remains the same. We are looking through the cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers, and we are managing through the downturn by on our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. In the long-term, we anticipate that unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater will offer the most significant growth opportunities. That hasn't changed, although each of these markets faces economic challenges right now. Ultimately, when this market recovers, we believe North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside, and Halliburton is best positions to outperform.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks."

Looking ahead, we're not going to try to call the exact shape of recovery, but we do believe that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be and when that recovery comes, we expect North America will offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way.

Obviously, some of our customers have their share price just crashed, and some pulled back but also to the point where we do believe that maybe they can go back in the market for equity if there is a more optimistic view of where WTI prices. I think the customer discussions are really wait -- we're going to wait and see right now we are going to reload our capital for next year. Some of them are talking about getting back to work as early as January, coming off of Q4 lull, and some I think are going to take a bit of a wait-and-see. But I think very, very few of them and certainly I don't think I've had the single discussion with the customer are going to let themselves get into a position of a meaningful decline in production before they figure out a way to start drilling again. And then there's another group of customers out there that really view that there is a subset of the customer base that will not get access to money, that will see a decline, that have good acreage, and they are going to be absolutely juicy takeover candidates at that point, Brian. So I think it's just we've got a wait and see, redeterminations are going on it looks generally to me like it's a sort of kick the can down the road approach has been taken at this point but that really just pushes the day of reckoning in sort of the first quarter of next year but the reality is that the strong customers are going to survive.

If you go to an offshore kind of a project, the cost is really in the E&C, it's on the day rate on the drilling rig and on the services work that we do is maybe 20% of that. And so the leverage point that customers have gone for there -- and obviously, you all follow the sector -- has been to the dayrates on the drilling contractors and today E&C companies with a discussion with us on services rates, but we're not the cost still a go of the dog on the offshore stuff, it's really on the other guys, and that's where really the pricing leverage has been directed initially."

So it's certainly not going to be the first quarter or 2 of high oil prices before you see a bounce back in the actual contracting for revenue in the offshore.

During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review, today we will not be taking any questions related to regulatory matters.
Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements.
These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. 
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our website.

As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity price",1189,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices and the pressure that their own shareholders are putting on them. Considering the difficult headwinds that were working against us, I'm actually very pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter, especially for our Eastern Hemisphere operations.
Now let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially, outperforming our largest peer. I'm very pleased with the resilience of our international business, where we again outperformed our largest peer on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for both revenue and margins.  This demonstrates once again that we are not getting distracted as we go through the merger process, and I am confident that from what we are seeing in the marketplace, this is the same for Baker Hughes. And despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to maintain operating margins due to a relentless focus on cost management.
As expected, North America revenue and operating income declined further as a result of lower activity levels and pricing pressure. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the peak that we saw last November, our Completions-related activity has declined approximately 18% relative to a 58% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn, and it positions us well for when the market recovers.
And finally, we took an additional restructuring charge to reflect current market conditions. But let me remind you, as we approach the finish line on the Baker Hughes acquisition, we continue to maintain North American infrastructure well beyond current market needs, incurring a cost which we would have otherwise eliminated. This cost impacted North America margins by approximately 400 basis points in the third quarter.
Now turning to operations. In North America, prices continued to erode during the third quarter, impacting the total services industry profitability, obviously, including ourselves. We believe these prices are clearly unsustainable, but as we have been saying all along, pricing cannot stabilize until activity stabilizes. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, visibility is murky at best. Based on current feedback, we believe most operators have exhausted their 2015 budgets and will take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving, therefore, activity levels could drop substantially in the last 5 weeks of the year. In my 22 years in this business, I've never seen a market where we've had less near-term visibility. In reality, we are managing this business on a near-realtime basis, customer-by-customer, district-by-district, product line by product line and yes, even crew-by-crew. But you know me and you know our management team; nobody knows the North America land market better than us. We are the execution company, and we know what levers to pull to make this market work. 
Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post-Thanksgiving, we expect to see a slow ramp-up beginning in January and improving from there, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle. 
If you pull back and look at the full year 2016 and compare it to 2015, you could envision a similar mirror image, directionally a slow start and then perhaps picking up speed in the second half of the year. Now there obviously are a number of moving parts in North America, but I'm not confident enough yet to call the exact shape of this recovery, but we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. Until then, we will continue to execute on our strategy, and we will be watching the same external data points that you do: what is happening to oil production, what is the rig count doing, what is happening with operators' cash flows and how are redeterminations impacting our customers' credit lines. And in addition, we have our own proprietary internal metrics that we will follow. 
We will continue to adjust our cost structure to market conditions. But to me, it does not make sense to reduce cost or infrastructure to reflect expected fourth quarter's reduced activity levels. Instead, we are positioning our North America land business for future success and to ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers. 
Internationally, I remain very happy with where our business is today. The international markets have held up better than North America, but they are not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. We did experience lower prices during the quarter but in anticipation of these reductions, we aggressively went after further cost adjustments. And although we had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency.
Internationally for 2016, we expect to see a continuation of trends from 2015. Land-based activity, including mature fields, should be the most resilient, while we expect offshore to see additional project delays.
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced the second tranche of businesses to be marketed for sale in connection with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and we expect that marketing process to begin shortly. On the first tranche of divestitures, we have now moved into the negotiation process. On the regulatory front, during the quarter, the timing agreement with the DOJ was extended by 3 weeks. And accordingly, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to extend the closing date to December 16. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with completing the required filings and obtaining the necessary approvals. Specific to the European Commission, we are working cooperatively to respond to their information request and expect to resubmit our filing in the near future, which will start the formal review process. Let me be very clear: we remain confident this deal will be approved. We continue to target a 2015 close, but the transaction could move into 2016, which is allowed under the merger agreement. We are enthusiastic about, and fully committed to, closing this compelling transaction and achieving our annual cost synergy target of nearly $2 billion. I want to be clear, this $2 billion will be on top of any cost reductions that we've made to date. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oilfield services company, combining our highly complementary suites of services and products into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"

Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to $506 million. North America led the decline as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, third quarter revenue declined by 5%, while operating income margins remained unchanged to second quarter levels. The impact of price negotiations with our customers in the first half has been offset primarily by a proactive reduction in operational costs. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 4%, with a similar decline in operating income of 3%. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were partially offset by increased activity in the UAE and Iraq.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw third quarter revenue declined by 7%, with a decrease in operating income of 9%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower activity in Angola and East Africa. Latin America revenue and operating income both declined 4% during the quarter, driven primarily by reduced activity in Mexico. Partially offsetting this decline was improved unconventional activity levels in Argentina. 
Moving to North America, revenue declined 7% with operating income at near breakeven levels. Reduced activity levels throughout U.S. land were accompanied by further price reductions across the business, especially in the pumping-related product lines.
Globally, the continued activity declines and pricing pressures led us to take additional actions to adjust our cost structure. As a result, we incurred an additional restructuring charge of $257 million after tax in the third quarter, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As this market plays out, we will evaluate our operations and make further adjustments as required.
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $58 million for the quarter, and we estimate that our Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $65 million.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in a bit higher at 29% due to the impact of gains from our foreign currency hedging program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance by an additional $200 million to $2.4 billion for the year. This represents a 27% year-over-year decline. However, our Q10 program remains intact as we derive significant cost savings from its deployment, and the Q10 provides us the ability to address the higher completions intensity experienced by the industry.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our operations outlook, starting with our international business. We believe that typical seasonal uptick in year-end sales will be minimal this year, as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat to modestly lower compared to the third quarter. 
In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators and a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict. So far, the average horizontal rig count is down a little less than 10% from the third quarter average. If these headwinds play out, we estimate that the fourth quarter average horizontal rig count could drop about 15% to 20% sequentially. We expect our North America revenues and margins to decline, but we anticipate sequential decrementals to be only in the midteens due to our cost-reduction efforts.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

To begin, I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our operational teams for once again executing to our playbook. I'm telling you, we are not distracted. I particularly like to recognize the performance of our international employees for staying dead focused on our business in a very difficult market. 
Now what's on everyone's mind is North America, so let me give you a little more granularity on North America by division. Our Drilling-related businesses have been much more resilient than our Completions-related businesses. In fact, Drilling division margins increased this quarter to 10%, and this is including the 400-basis-point impact of the added costs that we're carrying in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Obviously, the most stressed part of our business is pumping. Now this is the business that we know the best. It's the business that recovers the fastest, it's the business that recovers the most sharply, and we know what that path looks like. 
It looks like this. It looks like staying with the fairway players in the basins that we know; it does not mean chasing every stake. It looks like staying with the customers that are loyal, even if that means working at a price that we don't like, collaborating on a path forward that lowers our cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And it looks like staying with the overall strategy to focus on long-term returns, meaning, we see a path to profitability. This is a very simple solution. But simple does not mean easy. So if you're looking for a silver lining here, the most competitive piece of the business, pumping, is the one that we know the best. It's the business that recovers the fastest and the most sharply, and you can be confident that we have the team that gets it done. 
The last time we reported earnings, oil was in the upper $50s, and the outlook was cautiously optimistic. Since then, we saw oil dropped into the $30s, which I can tell you elicited an immediate and visceral reaction from our customer base. And as I described in a conference during the quarter, the rig count followed the oil price down soon thereafter. Now this has caused us to continue to look carefully and strategically at the business and how we're structured to execute. 
In the short term, we further adjusted our operations. Recent actions we've taken include: partnering with our suppliers to find better ways to work together in these tougher times; leveraging our logistics infrastructure, including higher-rate usage of unit trains; and stacking additional equipment during the quarter where we either were unable to make an acceptable return or cannot see a path to acceptable returns; and finally, rightsizing the business to reflect current activity levels. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the year, market conditions have forced us to reduce our global headcount by over 21%. Now these are always tough decisions affecting great people, but they are simply decisions that we have to make. Consistent with maintaining our service delivery model to obtain the cost synergy savings in the Baker acquisition, we've taken a bottoms-up look at our service processes, including comparing our current structure to previous similarly sized markets. This is an examination of how we work those things absolutely required to deliver our value proposition, which also means stripping away everything that is not required. For example, in the third quarter, we eliminated an entire level of management in North America. In my view, this is not a onetime initiative. By clarifying and controlling how we execute, we can retain this efficiency, these cost savings, as the market recovers. We have a two-pronged strategy. The first part being to control who we control in the short term, and the second is looking beyond the cycle and preparing for the recovery. Q10s are a great example. The cost savings we derived from these new generation fleets are substantial compared to legacy equipment: 25% less capital on location, 30% less labor on-site and up to 50% less maintenance cost. Q10 spreads now represent close to 50% of our fleet, and we should be near 60% by the end of the year. At the same time, those legacy assets that are still deployed are being strategically placed to maximize their potential in locations or functions that maximize their cost effectiveness. While the industry is seeing average fleet sizes increase by 15% to 20% over the last 2 years due to rising completions intensity, our average fleet size has been essentially flat as a result of the more efficient Q10s. So when coupled with our logistics platform, we believe Halliburton offers the lowest total cost of service to our customers at any point in the cycle. We're pleased with our customer portfolio. Both in North America and on an international basis, we've aligned with customers who have strong balance sheets and assets and fairway positions in the basins. These are the customers that have better well economics and are continuing to work through the downturn and are engaged in the important cost per barrel discussions. Improving a customer's cost per barrel of oil equivalent is core to our value proposition. This is why we continue to invest in technology, and our emphasis is on 2 basic tenets. One is increasing reliability, eliminating moving parts, simplifying designs and helping eliminate nonproductive time at the well site. The second is making better wells. Products like AccessFrac, CoreVault and DecisionSpace help customers identify and assess the sweet spots of their reservoirs and, more importantly, these products have seen increased uptake during this downturn. Adoption of DecisionSpace is up double digits from 2014, for example; and the usage of AccessFrac has grown more than 60% over last year. There is no question that this is a challenging market today, but our playbook remains the same. We are looking through the cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers, and we are managing through the downturn by drawing on our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. 
In the long term, we anticipate that unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater will offer the most significant growth opportunities. That hasn't changed, although each of these markets faces economic challenges right now. Ultimately, when this market recovers, we believe North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside, and Halliburton is best positioned to outperform.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks."

And I think one of the things that our customers demonstrate -- and believe me, we love all our customers, if they have cash, they're going to spend it. And so really, it depends on how quickly they want to ramp up. But I do think that as we look at the potentiality of Q1, if there is a slow ramp-up that gets a little better toward the end of the first quarter, I think that could be the bottom from a margin standpoint then at that point in time. And then my comment about sort of the rest of 2016 for North America looking a bit like a mirror image of 2015, if you get off the mark slow in your spend, then I think it really does come a little stronger in the back half of the year, and that gives us some hope at this point in time."

The other factor that we're seeing now is service intensity continues to increase actually on a per-well basis, and so that's, yet again, harder on the equipment that is working. So if we look at what's stacked today, we think about half of that equipment stacked today will not be ultimately serviceable. So that may be in the -- there estimates 4 to 6 million horsepower out of the market in '16, and that's very realistic. If we go back and think about 2013 Q4, we had talked about a 30% or so overhang of equipment then, and that capacity overage narrowed to 5% by the end of Q1 of '14. So that didn't happen in 90 days, that happened throughout that downturn period. So the takeaway is that's exactly why we're committed to Frac of the Future and having equipment in place is able to perform sort of in this environment."

You can argue all the macroeconomics, where is breakeven price point? I think -- there's really actually, I think a different way you need to think about the customer base in North America, especially the independent customer base, and that's essentially with the high decline curves that exist on these unconventional plays. They really are in drill or die mode. So if you go a year without drilling a well and your production starts to turn over, you're going to have to start drilling or you're going to have to take your infrastructure apart that you've built up as a company. So I think that as we get to the end of the year, if these guys have money, they're going to drill it up, and that's just the fact that is. Now oil is at $60. I think the banks will be more comfortable with extending lines of credit with sort of the debt positions that are there, but I think that the real key is going to be the production declines you see. And when these companies get to the point where they have to start drilling or they have to start dismantling their companies, then they're not going to want to do that."

This is really -- we can do that because of the discipline that we have around how we execute process. And as that continue to tighten, we've actually seen into the downturn service quality getting better, not worse. And that's unusual actually going into a market like this. I attribute that to the discipline around execution, and so that then allows us to remove that layer as we -- so that's that thought. If we think about other opportunities, we're constantly evaluating things that we can do to take costs out of our business, and this is in North America and the rest of the world in terms of maintenance process, value-engineering exercises, Kaizen events.

So what we talked about last quarter, probably 1/4 has been -- 1/4 to 1/2 has been absorbed during the current quarter, though, as long as we see pricing -- commodity pricing where it is and delays in terms of activity, I fully expect we will continue to see this. Now, the better discussion that we have with clients is around how to drive efficiency and how to use those things that are in our value proposition around increasing reliability and reducing uncertainty to help lower their overall cost. And I would say I'm pleased that we're having more discussions that look like that with clients as they realize that they reached kind of limits around what's available in the service sector."

So if you go back to a, let's say, U.S. horizontal unconventional well and it costs $1, about $0.70 of that dollar is focused on the completion, particularly the frac. So that's naturally where customers have gone in terms of the pressure to reduce cost. If you go to an offshore kind of a project, the cost is really in the E&C, it's in the day rate on the drilling rig and the services work that we do is maybe 20% of that. And so the leverage point that customers have gone for there, and obviously, you all follow the sector, has been to the day rates on the drilling contractors and to the E&C companies with a discussion with us on services rates, but we're not the sort of cost tail wagging the dog on the offshore stuff, it's really the other guys, and that's where really the pricing leverage has been directed initially."

So it's certainly not going to be the first quarter or 2 of high oil prices before you see a bounce back in the actual contracting for revenue in the offshore. You might see some feed start-up, you might see some pretty engineering start-up, you might see project planning starting up, and all of that would be good because it's a sign that they're thinking about going more and quickly into the deeper water, but it's going to be several quarters, and it really is going to be building confidence back up on the IOCs that the market is there for the long run."

As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity price",1189,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices and the pressure that their own shareholders are putting on them. Considering the difficult headwinds that were working against us, I'm actually very pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter, especially for our Eastern Hemisphere operations.
Now let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially, outperforming our largest peer. I'm very pleased with the resilience of our international business, where we again outperformed our largest peer on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for both revenue and margins.  This demonstrates once again that we are not getting distracted as we go through the merger process, and I am confident that from what we are seeing in the marketplace, this is the same for Baker Hughes. And despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to maintain operating margins due to a relentless focus on cost management.
As expected, North America revenue and operating income declined further as a result of lower activity levels and pricing pressure. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the peak that we saw last November, our Completions-related activity has declined approximately 18% relative to a 58% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn, and it positions us well for when the market recovers.
And finally, we took an additional restructuring charge to reflect current market conditions. But let me remind you, as we approach the finish line on the Baker Hughes acquisition, we continue to maintain North American infrastructure well beyond current market needs, incurring a cost which we would have otherwise eliminated. This cost impacted North America margins by approximately 400 basis points in the third quarter.
Now turning to operations. In North America, prices continued to erode during the third quarter, impacting the total services industry profitability, obviously, including ourselves. We believe these prices are clearly unsustainable, but as we have been saying all along, pricing cannot stabilize until activity stabilizes. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, visibility is murky at best. Based on current feedback, we believe most operators have exhausted their 2015 budgets and will take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving, therefore, activity levels could drop substantially in the last 5 weeks of the year. In my 22 years in this business, I've never seen a market where we've had less near-term visibility. In reality, we are managing this business on a near-realtime basis, customer-by-customer, district-by-district, product line by product line and yes, even crew-by-crew. But you know me and you know our management team; nobody knows the North America land market better than us. We are the execution company, and we know what levers to pull to make this market work. 
Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post-Thanksgiving, we expect to see a slow ramp-up beginning in January and improving from there, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle. If you pull back and look at the full year 2016 and compare it to 2015, you could envision a similar mirror image, directionally a slow start and then perhaps picking up speed in the second half of the year. Now there obviously are a number of moving parts in North America, and I'm not confident enough yet to call the exact shape of this recovery, but we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. 
Until then, we will continue to execute on our strategy, and we will be watching the same external data points that you do: what is happening to oil production, what is the rig count doing, what is happening with operators' cash flows and how are redeterminations impacting our customers' credit lines. And in addition, we have our own proprietary internal metrics that we will follow.  We will continue to adjust our cost structure to market conditions. But to me, it does not make sense to reduce costs or infrastructure to reflect expected fourth quarter's reduced activity levels. Instead, we are positioning our North America land business for future success and to ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers. 
Internationally, I remain very happy with where our business is today. The international markets have held up better than North America, but they are not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. We did experience lower prices during the quarter but in anticipation of these reductions, we aggressively went after further cost adjustments. And although we had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. Internationally for 2016, we expect to see a continuation of trends from 2015. Land-based activity, including mature fields, should be the most resilient, while we expect offshore to see additional project delays.
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced the second tranche of businesses to be marketed for sale in connection with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and we expect that marketing process to begin shortly. On the first tranche of divestitures, we have now moved into the negotiation process. On the regulatory front, during the quarter, the timing agreement with the DOJ was extended by 3 weeks. And accordingly, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to extend the closing date to December 16. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with completing the required filings and obtaining the necessary approvals. Specific to the European Commission, we are working cooperatively to respond to their information request and expect to resubmit our filing in the near future, which will start the formal review process. Let me be very clear: we remain confident this deal will be approved. We continue to target a 2015 close, but the transaction could move into 2016, which is allowed under the merger agreement. 
We are enthusiastic about, and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction and achieving our annual cost synergy target of nearly $2 billion. I want to be clear, this $2 billion will be on top of any cost reductions that we've made to date. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oilfield services company, combining our highly complementary suites of services and products into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers.

Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to $506 million. North",598,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to $506 million. North America led the decline as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, third quarter revenue declined by 5%, while operating income margins remained unchanged to second quarter levels. The impact of price negotiations with our customers in the first half has been offset primarily by a proactive reduction in operational costs. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 4%, with a similar decline in operating income of 3%. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were partially offset by increased activity in the UAE and Iraq. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw third quarter revenue declined by 7%, with a decrease in operating income of 9%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower activity in Angola and East Africa. Latin America revenue and operating income both declined 4% during the quarter, driven primarily by reduced activity in Mexico. Partially offsetting this decline was improved unconventional activity levels in Argentina. Moving to North America, revenue declined 7% with operating income at near breakeven levels. Reduced activity levels throughout U.S. land were accompanied by further price reductions across the business, especially in the pumping-related product lines.
Globally, the continued activity declines and pricing pressures led us to take additional actions to adjust our cost structure. As a result, we incurred an additional restructuring charge of $257 million after tax in the third quarter, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As this market plays out, we will evaluate our operations and make further adjustments as required. Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $58 million for the quarter, and we estimate that our Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in a bit higher at 29% due to the impact of gains from our foreign currency hedging program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance by an additional $200 million to $2.4 billion for the year. This represents a 27% year-over-year decline. However, our Q10 program remains intact as we derive significant cost savings from its deployment, and the Q10 provides us the ability to address the higher completions intensity experienced by the industry.
Finally, let me give you some comments on our operations outlook, starting with our international business. We believe that typical seasonal uptick in year-end sales will be minimal this year, as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat to modestly lower compared to the third quarter. 
In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators and a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict. So far, the average horizontal rig count is down a little less than 10% from the third quarter average. If these headwinds play out, we estimate that the fourth quarter average horizontal rig count could drop about 15% to 20% sequentially. We expect our North America revenues and margins to decline, but we anticipate sequential decrementals to be only in the midteens due to our cost-reduction efforts.

To begin, I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our operational teams for once again executing to our playbook. I am telling you, we are not distracted. I particularly like to recognize the performance of our international employees for staying dead focused on our business in a very difficult market. 
Now what's on everyone's mind is North America, so let me give you a little more granularity on North America by division. Our Drilling-related businesses have been much more resilient than our Completions-related businesses. In fact, Drilling division margins increased this quarter to 10%, and this is including the 400-basis-point impact of the added costs that we're carrying in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Obviously, the most stressed part of our business is pumping. Now this is the business that we know the best. It's the business that recovers the fastest, it's the business that recovers the most sharply, and we know what that path looks like. 
It looks like this. It looks like staying with the fairway players in the basins that we know; it does not mean chasing every stake. It looks like staying with the customers that are loyal, even if that means working at a price that we don't like, collaborating on a path forward that lowers our cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And it looks like staying with the overall strategy to focus on long-term returns, meaning, we see a path to profitability. This is a very simple solution. But simple does not mean easy. So if you're looking for a silver lining here, the most competitive piece of the business, pumping, is the one that we know the best. It's the business that recovers the fastest and the most sharply, and you can be confident that we have the team that gets it done. 
Now, last time we reported earnings, oil was in the upper $50s, and the outlook was cautiously optimistic. Since then, we saw oil dropped into the $30s, which I can tell you elicited an immediate and visceral reaction from our customer base. And as I described in a conference during the quarter, the rig count followed the oil price down soon thereafter. Now this has caused us to continue to look carefully and strategically at the business and how we're structured to execute. 
In the short term, we further adjusted our operations. Recent actions we've taken include: partnering with our suppliers to find better ways to work together in these tougher times; leveraging our logistics infrastructure, including higher-rate usage of unit trains; and stacking additional equipment during the quarter where we either were unable to make an acceptable return or cannot see a path to acceptable returns; and finally, rightsizing the business to reflect current activity levels. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the year, market conditions have forced us to reduce our global headcount by over 21%. Now these are always tough decisions affecting great people, but they are simply decisions that we have to make. 
Consistent with maintaining our service delivery model to obtain the cost synergy savings in the Baker acquisition, we've taken a bottoms-up look at our service processes, including comparing our current structure to previous similarly sized markets. This is an examination of how we work those things absolutely required to deliver our value proposition, which also means stripping away everything that is not required. For example, in the third quarter, we eliminated an entire level of management in North America. In my view, this is not a onetime initiative. By clarifying and controlling how we execute, we can retain this efficiency, these cost savings, as the market recovers. 
We have a two-pronged strategy. The first part being to control what we control in the short term, and the second is looking beyond the cycle and preparing for the recovery. Q10s are a great example. The cost savings we derived from these new generation fleets are substantial compared to legacy equipment: 25% less capital on location, 30% less labor on-site and up to 50% less maintenance cost. Q10 spreads now represent close to 50% of our fleet, and we should be near 60% by the end of the year. At the same time, those legacy assets that are still deployed are being strategically placed to maximize their potential in locations or functions that maximize their cost effectiveness.  While the industry is seeing average fleet sizes increase by 15% to 20% over the last 2 years due to rising completions intensity, our average fleet size has been essentially flat as a result of the more efficient Q10s. 
So when coupled with our logistics platform, we believe Halliburton offers the lowest total cost of service to our customers at any point in the cycle. We're pleased with our customer portfolio. Both in North America and on an international basis, we've aligned with customers who have strong balance sheets and assets and fairway positions in the basins. These are the customers that have better well economics and are continuing to work through the downturn and are engaged in the important cost per barrel discussions. Improving a customer's cost per barrel of oil equivalent is core to our value proposition. This is why we continue to invest in technology, and our emphasis is on 2 basic tenets. One is increasing reliability, eliminating moving parts, simplifying designs and helping eliminate nonproductive time at the well site. The second is making better wells. Products like AccessFrac, CoreVault and DecisionSpace help customers identify and assess the sweet spots of their reservoirs and, more importantly, these products have seen increased uptake during this downturn. Adoption of DecisionSpace is up double digits from 2014, for example; and the usage of AccessFrac has grown more than 60% over last year. There is no question that this is a challenging market today, but our playbook remains the same. We are looking through the cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers, and we are managing through the downturn by drawing on our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. 
In the long term, we anticipate that unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater will offer the most significant growth opportunities. That hasn't changed, although each of these markets faces economic challenges right now. Ultimately, when this market recovers, we believe North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside, and Halliburton is best positioned to outperform.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks."

To sum up, we continue to make progress with the Baker Hughes acquisition, and we are diligently focused on finalizing all regulatory matters, completing the divestiture process and preparing for integration activities after closing the deal. We are managing the downturn by executing our two-pronged strategy, getting down to our purest form of cost while retaining the flexibility to grow in our usual disciplined way as activity levels recover. For the fourth quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty as we approach the holiday season, but we believe that customer budgets will reload in the first quarter and anticipate activity to ramp up in the second half of 2016.
Looking ahead, we're not going to try to call the exact shape of recovery, but we do believe that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. And when that recovery comes, we expect North America will offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way. And finally, there is no doubt that this is going to be a bumpy road, but history would tell you that we have outperformed in these kinds of markets, turning them into a new catalyst for growth. We are the execution company, so you can be sure that whatever the market gives us, we will take it and then take some more.

I think the big question mark is how fast do our customers go back to work once they do reload their budgets, given off what we think will be a relatively low set of rig count volume in the latter part of the quarter, especially in December. So it really depends on the bounce back, but the cash will be there. And I think one of the things that our customers demonstrate -- and believe me, we love all our customers, if they have cash, they're going to spend it. And so really, it depends on how quickly they want to ramp up. But I do think that as we look at the potentiality of Q1, if there's a slow ramp-up that gets a little better toward the end of the first quarter, I think that could be the bottom from a margin standpoint then at that point in time. And then my comment about sort of the rest of 2016 for North America looking a bit like a mirror image of 2015, if you get off the mark slow in your spend, then I think it really does come a little stronger in the back half of the year, and that gives us some hope at this point in time."

If we look at the amount of horsepower that's idled right now, just on the sidelines, about half of it's on the sidelines today in terms of stacked equipment, and that's equipment that's not getting any maintenance and it's being cannibalized for parts. The other factor that we're seeing now is service intensity continues to increase actually on a per-well basis, and so that's, yet again, harder on the equipment that is working. So if we look at what's stacked today, we think about half of that equipment stacked today will not be ultimately serviceable. So that may be in the -- there are estimates 4 to 6 million horsepower out of the market in '16, and that's very realistic. If we go back and think about 2013 Q4, we had talked about a 30% or so overhang of equipment then, and that capacity overage narrowed to 5% by the end of Q1 of '14. So that didn't happen in 90 days, that happened throughout that downturn period.

You can argue all the macroeconomics, where is breakeven price point? I think there's really actually, I think a different way you need to think about the customer base in North America, especially the independent customer base. And that's essentially with the high decline curves that exist on these unconventional plays, they really are in drill or die mode. So if you go a year without drilling a well and your production starts to turn over, you're going to have to start drilling or you're going to have to take your infrastructure apart that you've built up as a company. So I think that as we get to the end of the year, if these guys have money, they're going to drill it up, and that's just the fact that is. Now if oil's at $60, I think the banks will be more comfortable with extending lines of credit with sort of the debt positions that are there, but I think that the real key is going to be the production declines you see. And when these companies get to the point where they have to start drilling or they have to start dismantling their companies, then they're not going to want to do that."

So if you go back to a, let's say, U.S. horizontal unconventional well and it costs $1, about $0.70 of that dollar is focused on the completion, particularly the frac. So that's naturally where customers have gone in terms of the pressure to reduce cost. If you go to an offshore kind of a project, the cost is really in the E&C cost, it's in the day rate on the drilling rig and the services work that we do is maybe 20% of that. And so the leverage point that customers have gone for there, and obviously, you all follow the sector, has been to the day rates on the drilling contractors and to the E&C companies with a discussion with us on services rates, but we're not the sort of cost tail wagging the dog on the offshore stuff.

The NOCs have not pulled back as dramatically as the IOCs have with respect to their deepwater projects. And so the NOCs, I think, will -- if you think about sort of a slow wave up and down, I think that's what you are going to see. But I think that if you look at the economics deepwater development, I believe the IOCs are going to have to be convinced that not only are the prices at a point where these things get at least cash flow in the long run, that they see an upward trajectory in oil prices that they can make a return on these deepwater projects over a period a year. So it's certainly not going to be the first quarter or 2 of high oil prices before you see a bounce back in the actual contracting for revenue in the offshore. You might see some feed start-up, you might see some pre-engineering start-up, you might see project planning starting up, and all of that would be good because it's a sign that they're thinking about going more and quickly into the deeper water, but it is going to be several quarters, and it really is going to be building confidence back up on the IOCs that the market is there for the long run."
