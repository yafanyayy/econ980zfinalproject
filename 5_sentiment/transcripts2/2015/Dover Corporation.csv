Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw a robust",622,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw a robust top line growth at each segment led by Energy and Fluids, resulting in overall growth of 11%, including organic growth of 6%. We also achieved solid volume leverage as 3 of our 4 segments improved margin, excluding restructuring costs. 
From a geographic perspective, we saw solid growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia whereas Latin America continued to be weak. Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. 
In Energy, revenue growth was strong as U.S. drilling and production customer activity was as expected. Our recent acquisition, Accelerated, exceeded our expectations, and the automation in Bearings & Compression markets were solid. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our recent MS acquisition continue to perform well and more than offset European softness in our core printing and coating markets. The industrial platform achieved strong broad-based growth led by outstanding results in our auto-related and waste handling businesses. 
Our Fluids segment once again performed well, where continuing robust market conditions for Fluid Transfer products and improved pump markets resulted in organic growth of 9%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated very strong revenue growth of 8%, where strong Refrigeration performance was supported by shipments of quarter 3 push outs.
Since the end of the third quarter, we have taken actions to strengthen and position our company for 2015, with a focus on our portfolio and cost reduction. We've made the decision to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent, which now have been reported as discontinued operations. While both are strong companies, these actions increase our focus on our core growth markets.
Also, as indicated at our Investor Day in early December, we took decisive actions to adjust our costs and streamline our businesses. We executed well on our restructuring initiatives and completed our planned actions in the fourth quarter. 
Specific to Energy. Though U.S. drilling and production revenue and customer activity has been as strong as expected, we have been proactively reducing cost in anticipation of lower customer activity in 2015. Our acquisition pipeline continues to rebuild though no significant deals are imminent. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and recently put a new standing authorization in place. 
Now let me provide our revenue outlook for 2015, which is unchanged from our Investor Day for Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Their markets have remained healthy, and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. 
As you would expect, the big change to our forecast is in Energy, where the rapid decline in oil prices is significantly impacting Energy CapEx spending and U.S. rig counts. As a result, within Energy, we expect lower revenue in our U.S.-based drilling and production businesses. However, we continue to expect our international oil and gas activity and our Bearings & Compression businesses to grow. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth driven by strong dynamics in our industrial platform and global growth in Printing & Identification. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for our Pumps and Fluid Transfer businesses, supported by increased Safety and Environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new product introductions. 
And lastly, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to grow, driven by our focus on customer service and best-in-class products. We expect to grow our position with many customers in 2015, driven by innovative products like CO2 systems and heat exchangers, to name just a few. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 11%. Organic revenue grew 6%, and growth from acquisitions was 7%, offset by 2% of FX. Adjust",1530,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 11%. Organic revenue grew 6%, and growth from acquisitions was 7%, offset by 2% of FX. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.01, excluding discrete tax benefits. This result includes $0.17 of restructuring and other costs. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 14.8%, 210 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting costs, our overall margin was 17.3%. 
Bookings increased 4% over the prior year to $1.9 billion led by Energy and Engineered Systems. Overall, book to bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog was essentially flat at $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was $390 million for the quarter. For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $787 million, 10% of revenue or 100% conversion of net income. 
Now turning to Slide 4. All segments grew organically in the quarter. Fluids grew 9%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer and pump markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment, driven in part by shipments of Q3 push outs, grew 8%. Engineered Systems grew 5% with strong growth in the industrial platform. Energy was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 7% comprised of 20% in Energy whereas Engineered Systems grew 4%, and Fluids increased 3%. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 2% from the third quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality. Overall Energy grew 8% while Fluids increased 4%. Engineered Systems was down 3% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 13%. Sequential bookings decreased 3%, principally reflecting anticipated lower orders in Refrigeration and the timing of orders in Food Equipment. In all, Engineered Systems grew 5%, and Energy increased 2% on the strength of acquisitions. Fluids declined 2%, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 20%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $550 million increased 20%, and earnings of $105 million decreased 6% from last year. Excluding the combined $19 million impact of Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting costs, earnings increased 11%. 
Overall, as we expected, Energy produced a very good quarter. Strong revenue growth in our drilling and production markets was largely driven by acquisitions, the completion of the U.S. shale projects and solid Middle East activity. Our Bearings & Compression and automation markets remained modestly positive. 
We took restructuring actions in the fourth quarter as well as additional actions to align our cost to anticipated market conditions. We remain proactive and now expect to incur restructuring costs in Energy of $13 million to $15 million in the first quarter. When the first quarter actions are complete, we will have reduced our Energy headcount by approximately 900 or 14% in total. 
Excluding the Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting costs, our adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, slightly exceeding our expectations. Bookings were $535 million, a 21% increase over the prior year, largely reflecting acquisitions. Organic bookings grew 2%. Book to bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where revenue of $592 million was up 6%, and earnings of $93 million increased 7%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 11% to $97 million. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 4% to $248 million, primarily driven by strong digital printing results. Organic revenue grew 1%, where solid equipment sales were partially offset by a softer Europe. FX was a 6% headwind in this platform in the fourth quarter. 
In the industrial platform, revenue grew 8% to $345 million, all of which was organic. Revenue growth was broad-based with particularly strong performance in our auto-related and waste handling businesses. 
Adjusted margin was up 70 basis points to 16.4% on volume leverage, excluding restructuring. Bookings were $623 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 6% to $248 million, driven by acquisitions earlier in the year and generally solid market conditions. Industrial bookings increased 15% to $374 million, reflecting strong broad-based growth. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 1 while industrial's was 1.09. Overall, book to bill was 1.05. 
Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter, where revenue increased 10% to $377 million, and earnings of $63 million were up 14%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 20% to $66 million. 
Revenue was driven by organic growth of 9% and acquisition growth of 3%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets, increased safety environmental regulations and share gains. Pumps was driven by healthy chemical markets and new product introductions. 
Excluding restructuring, adjusted margin was 17.4%, an increase of 140 basis points, resulting from strong leverage on volume. Bookings were $346 million, a decrease of 2%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps. Book to bill was 0.92. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $459 million, up 8% over the prior year. Excluding restructuring of $25 million, earnings improved 19% to $56 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong Refrigeration shipments, supported by Q3 push outs. Excluding restructuring, adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, a 130 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects improved performance in volume leverage. 
Bookings were $368 million, a decrease of 18%, principally reflecting an anticipated reduction in orders in Refrigeration and the timing of orders in Food Equipment. Book to bill was 0.80. 
Now going to the overview slide, #10. Fourth quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $30 million, consistent with expectations and included a $3.6 million pension settlement charge. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding $0.02 of discrete benefits. This rate was lower than in previous forecast and principally impacted by the R&D tax credit and tax benefits related to restructuring actions. Capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. For the full year, we invested $166 million or 2.1% of revenue. 
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $208 million. For the full year, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $601 million. 
Now on Slide 11, which is an update on Energy. As Bob said, a lot has changed in Energy since our Investor Day. As a result, we expect our U.S. drilling and new well production businesses to be significantly impacted by lower commodity costs. We expect this impact to be less but still present in our businesses within U.S. recurring production and automation exposure. Finally, we expect our Bearings & Compression and international oil and gas activity to remain very solid. 
We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 6% to 9%, a reduction of about 15 points from our prior forecast or about $300 million in revenue with organic revenue declining 11% to 14%. The biggest change is in our drilling and production markets, primarily driven by the anticipated reduction in U.S. shale activity. Our automation forecast has changed slightly whereas Bearings & Compression remains unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Now moving to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be positive 1% to negative 2%, principally reflecting our current forecast for Energy as our other 3 segments remain unchanged. Completed acquisitions will now add 2%, down 1 point from our prior expectations. 
We now expect the total impact of FX to be a 2% headwind, 1 point higher than our prior forecast. 
In summary, we expect total year-over-year revenue to be 1% positive to 2% negative. Segment margin is expected to be between 17.6% and 17.9%, excluding restructuring charges. 
Corporate expense will be approximately $125 million, and interest expense should be around $130 million. We expect the full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 30%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now turning to the bridge on Slide 13. Note that in the appendix is information that provides the basis of our 2015 guide. 
In 2015, we expect net restructuring, essentially the non-repeat of Q4 cost netted against Q1 expected cost and other onetime items, to add $0.09 to $0.10. Performance, which includes volume and price productivity, compensation and investment and restructuring benefits, will be in the range of a $0.10 benefit to a $0.06 decline, largely depending on volume. 
The impact of acquisitions already completed will be $0.01 to $0.03. Shares will provide $0.27 to $0.29 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and carryover benefit of our 2014 repurchases. Our share repurchase activity will more than offset the $0.18 dilutive impact of discontinued operations. Interest, corporate and tax rate will have a combined $0.07 to $0.11 impact. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $4.70 to $4.95, reflecting a $0.35 reduction to our prior guidance. 
One last note. As we move sequentially into 2015, our first quarter EPS will be impacted by approximately $17 million to $20 million in Q1 restructuring charges as well as remaining purchase accounting cost. Combined, these items will impact Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

That's Belvac, and I think that almost half of that 20% or 18% year-over-year decline is just associated to the timing of orders at Belvac, and there's nothing wrong with the Belvac business. It will continue to perform quite well. It's just timing of orders. With respect to Hill PHOENIX, Scott, I would tell you that we did another record year in revenue at Hill PHOENIX. I think they had a 2% or 3% organic growth in 2014. We had a year where book to bill again was 1.0 for Hill PHOENIX like it was in 2013. But you see between the 2 years, a very, very different waterfall of quarterly order rates at Hill PHOENIX, and part of what you see in the fourth quarter is anticipated product mix change. I call it a slight product mix change as we go into 2015, and we will expect in 2015 a little bit higher weighting in our business mix towards doors, doors with or pieces with doors and a little bit of a reduced weighting on systems. And part of that is showing up in the fourth quarter order rates. System orders tend to show up anywhere from 1 to 3 months before orders for cases do, and we're -- the fourth quarter order rates reflect that, and it was anticipated."

M&A and Energy, gosh, I would tell you that I'm not speaking for anyone other than Brad and I. M&A activity in the Energy sector in the next 3 or 4 months, I'm going to use your phrase, could be a bit uncomfortable simply because of the uncertainty of the timing, the uncertainty is the depth. And then even after the price of oil does recover and start to find a new normal that's higher than where it is today is what's going to happen with investment activity in the U.S. shale fields, and I think that to me, that's the more larger question. But I think as we get through perhaps not the first quarter. The first quarter is probably not going to give us enough information. I think as we get to the second quarter or into and through the second quarter, I guess that not only us but others in the sector may have a comfort level that's being developed that would allow us to make a decision or 2 on M&A.

On share repurchase activity, don't think that our share repurchase activity in 2015 is a diminishment of our ability to execute on M&A, and Brad can give you a lot more detail on this than I will or I could. But in real simplistic way to look at this, our share repurchase activity in 2015 is going to be funded by divestitures. Said and done. It's not -- we're not increasing anything, any debt on our balance sheet to fund share repurchase activity. We're not using operating cash flow to fund share repurchase activity.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw a robust",622,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw a robust top line growth at each segment led by Energy and Fluids, resulting in overall growth of 11%, including organic growth of 6%. We also achieved solid volume leverage as 3 of our 4 segments improved margin, excluding restructuring cost. 
From a geographic perspective, we saw solid growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia, whereas Latin America continued to be weak. Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. 
In Energy, revenue growth was strong, as U.S. drilling and production customer activity was as expected. Our recent acquisition, Accelerated, exceeded our expectations, and the Automation and Bearings & Compression markets were solid. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our recent MS acquisition continue to perform well and more than offset European softness in our core printing and coating markets. The industrial platform achieved strong broad-based growth led by outstanding results in our auto-related and waste handling businesses. 
Our Fluids segment once again performed well, where continuing robust market conditions for Fluid Transfer products and improved pump markets resulted in organic growth of 9%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated very strong revenue growth of 8%, where strong Refrigeration performance was supported by shipments of quarter 3 push outs.
Since the end of the third quarter, we have taken actions to strengthen and position our company for 2015, with a focus on our portfolio and cost reduction. We've made the decision to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent, which now have been reported as discontinued operations. While both are strong companies, these actions increase our focus on our core growth markets.
Also, as indicated at our Investor Day in early December, we took decisive actions to adjust our cost and streamline our businesses. We executed well on our restructuring initiatives and completed our planned actions in the fourth quarter. 
Specific to Energy, though U.S. drilling and production revenue and customer activity has been as strong as expected, we have been proactively reducing cost in anticipation of lower customer activity in 2015. Our acquisition pipeline continues to rebuild, though no significant deals are imminent. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and recently put a new standing authorization in place. 
Now let me provide our revenue outlook for 2015, which is unchanged from our Investor Day for Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Their markets have remained healthy, and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. 
As you would expect, the big change to our forecast is in Energy, where the rapid decline in oil prices is significantly impacting Energy CapEx spending and U.S. rig counts. As a result, within Energy, we expect lower revenue in our U.S.-based drilling and production businesses. However, we continue to expect our international oil and gas activity and our Bearings & Compression businesses to grow. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth driven by strong dynamics in our industrial platform and global growth in Printing & Identification. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for our Pumps and Fluid Transfer businesses, supported by increased Safety and Environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new product introductions. 
And lastly, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to grow, driven by our focus on customer service and best-in-class products. We expect to grow our position with many customers in 2015, driven by innovative products like CO2 systems and heat exchangers, to name just a few. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Bookings increased 4% over the prior year to $1.9 billion led by Energy and Engineered Systems. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog was essentially flat at $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was $390 million for the quarter. For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $787 million, 10% of revenue or 100% conversion of net income. 
Now turning to Slide 4. All segments grew organically in the quarter. Fluids grew 9%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer and pump markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment, driven in part by shipments of Q3 push outs, grew 8%. Engineered Systems grew 5% with strong growth in the industrial platform. Energy was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 7% comprised of 20% in Energy, whereas Engineered Systems grew 4%, and Fluids increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 2% from the third quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality. Overall Energy grew 8%, while Fluids increased 4%. Engineered Systems was down 3% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 13%. Sequential bookings decreased 3%, principally reflecting anticipated lower orders in Refrigeration and the timing of orders in Food Equipment. In all, Engineered Systems grew 5%, and Energy increased 2% on the strength of acquisitions. Fluids declined 2%, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 20%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $550 million increased 20%, and earnings of $105 million decreased 6% from last year. Excluding the combined $19 million impact of Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings increased 11%.
Overall, as we expected, Energy produced a very good quarter. Strong revenue growth in our drilling and production markets was largely driven by acquisitions, the completion of U.S. shale projects and solid Middle East activity. Our Bearings & Compression and automation markets remained modestly positive.
We took restructuring actions in the fourth quarter, as well as additional actions to align our cost to anticipated market conditions. We remain proactive and now expect to incur restructuring costs in Energy of $13 million to $15 million in the first quarter. When the first quarter actions are complete, we will have reduced our Energy headcount by approximately 900 or 14% in total.
Excluding the Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting costs, our adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, slightly exceeding our expectations. Bookings were $535 million, a 21% increase over the prior year, largely reflecting acquisitions. Organic bookings grew 2%. Book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where revenue of $592 million was up 6%, and earnings of $93 million increased 7%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 11% to $97 million. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 4% to $248 million, primarily driven by strong digital printing results. Organic revenue grew 1%, where solid equipment sales were partially offset by a softer Europe. FX was a 6% headwind in this platform in the fourth quarter. 
In the industrial platform, revenue grew 8% to $345 million, all of which was organic. Revenue growth was broad-based with particularly strong performance in our auto-related and waste handling businesses. 
Adjusted margin was up 70 basis points to 16.4% on volume leverage, excluding restructuring. Bookings were $623 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 6% to $248 million, driven by acquisitions earlier in the year and generally solid market conditions. Industrial bookings increased 15% to $374 million, reflecting strong broad-based growth. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1, while industrial's was 1.09. Overall, book to bill was 1.05. 
Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter, where revenue increased 10% to $377 million, and earnings of $63 million were up 14%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 20% to $66 million.
Revenue was driven by organic growth of 9% and acquisition growth of 3%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets, increased safety environmental regulations and share gains. Pumps was driven by healthy chemical markets and new product introductions.
Excluding restructuring, adjusted margin was 17.4%, an increase of 140 basis points, resulting from strong leverage on volume. Bookings were $346 million, a decrease of 2%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps. Book-to-bill was 0.92.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $459 million, up 8% over the prior year. Excluding restructuring of $25 million, earnings improved 19% to $56 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong Refrigeration shipments, supported by Q3 push outs. Excluding restructuring, adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, a 130 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects improved performance in volume leverage. 
Bookings were $368 million, a decrease of 18%, principally reflecting an anticipated reduction in orders in Refrigeration and the timing of orders in Food Equipment. Book-to-bill was 0.80. 
Now going to the overview slide, #10. Fourth quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $30 million, consistent with expectations and included a $3.6 million pension settlement charge. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding $0.02 of discrete benefits. This rate was lower than in previous forecast and principally impacted by the R&D tax credit and tax benefits related to restructuring actions. Capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. For the full year, we invested $166 million or 2.1% of revenue.
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $208 million. For the full year, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $601 million. 
Now on Slide 11, which is an update on Energy. As Bob said, a lot has changed in Energy since our Investor Day. As a result, we expect our U.S. drilling and new well production businesses to be significantly impacted by lower commodity costs. We expect this impact to be less,, but still present in our businesses within U.S. recurring production and automation exposure. Finally, we expect our Bearings & Compression and international oil and gas activity to remain very solid. 
We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 6% to 9%, a reduction of about 15 points from our prior forecast or about $300 million in revenue with organic revenue declining 11% to 14%. The biggest change is in our drilling and production markets, primarily driven by the anticipated reduction in U.S. shale activity. Our automation forecast has changed slightly, whereas Bearings & Compression remains unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Now moving to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be positive 1% to negative 2%, principally reflecting our current forecast for Energy, as our other 3 segments remain unchanged. Completed acquisitions will now add 2%, down 1 point from our prior expectations. We now expect the total impact of FX to be a 2% headwind, a point higher than our prior forecast. 
In summary, we expect total year-over-year revenue to be 1% positive to 2% negative. Segment margin is expected to be between 17.6% and 17.9%, excluding restructuring charges.
Corporate expense will be approximately $125 million, and interest expense should be around $130 million. We expect the full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 30%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.
Now turning to the bridge on Slide 13. Note that in the appendix is information that provides the basis of our 2015 guide. In 2015, we expect net restructuring, essentially the non-repeat of Q4 cost netted against Q1 expected cost and other onetime items, to add $0.09 to $0.10. Performance, which includes volume and price productivity, compensation and investment and restructuring benefits, will be in the range of a $0.10 benefit to a $0.06 decline, largely depending on volume. 
The impact of acquisitions already completed will be $0.01 to $0.03. Shares will provide $0.27 to $0.29 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and carryover benefit of our 2014 repurchases. Our share repurchase activity will more than offset the $0.18 dilutive impact of discontinued operations. Interest, corporate and tax rate will have a combined $0.07 to $0.11 impact. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $4.70 to $4.95, reflecting a $0.35 reduction to our prior guidance.
One last note. As we move sequentially into 2015, our first quarter EPS will be impacted by approximately $17 million to $20 million in Q1 restructuring charges, as well as remaining purchase accounting costs. Combined, these items will impact Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

First off, I would tell you that, I think Brad commented on this in his prepared remarks, part of that's due to just the timing of orders in our Food Equipment platform. We've got one business in the Food Equipment group that does have very choppy order rates. It's very much of a project business. That's Belvac, and I think that almost half of that 20% or 18% year-over-year decline is just associated to the timing of orders at Belvac, and there's nothing wrong with the Belvac business. It will continue to perform quite well. It's just timing of orders. With respect to Hill PHOENIX, Scott, I would tell you that we had another record year in revenue at Hill PHOENIX. I think they had a 2% or 3% organic growth in 2014. We had a year where book-to-bill again was 1.0 for Hill PHOENIX like it was in 2013. But you see between the 2 years, a very, very different waterfall of quarterly order rates at Hill PHOENIX, and part of what you see in the fourth quarter is an anticipated product mix change. I call it a slight product mix change, as we go into 2015, and we will expect in 2015, a little bit higher weighting in our business mix towards doors, doors with -- or cases with doors and a little bit of a reduced weighting on systems. And part of that is showing up in the fourth quarter order rates. System orders tend to show up anywhere from 1 to 3 months before orders for cases do, and we're -- the fourth quarter order rates reflect that, and it was anticipated."

It is not unusual for us to see that a little bit of I call it 2 to 3 week of inventory management period occur in the fourth quarter. It didn't occur this year.

We were able to bring on new employees quick enough to get them trained, that our customer service activity, which is always the thing we want to pay attention to, our customer service activity levels were quite high, and we did not disappoint customers. And at the end of the day, that's sort of what guides our decisions."

M&A and Energy, gosh, I would tell you that I'm not speaking for anyone other than Brad and I. M&A activity in the Energy sector in the next 3 or 4 months, I'm going to use your phrase, could be a bit uncomfortable, simply because of the uncertainty is the timing, the uncertainty is the depth. And then even after the price of oil does recover and start to find a new normal that's higher than where it is today is what's going to happen with investment activity in the U.S. shale fields, and I think that's the -- that, to me, that's the more larger question. But I think as we get through perhaps not the first quarter, the first quarter is probably not going to give us enough information. I think as we get through the second quarter or into and through the second quarter, I guess that, not only us, but others, in this sector may have a comfort level that's being developed that would allow us to make a decision or 2 on M&A. And if the opportunity is right for us, I'm going to tell you, we're going to look at it. But the comfort level's pretty high for the next 3 to 4 months. On share repurchase activity, don't think that our share repurchase activity in 2015 is a diminishment of our ability to execute on M&A, and Brad can give you a lot more detail on this than I will or I could. But a real simplistic way to look at this, our share repurchase activity in 2015 is going to be funded by divestitures. Said and done. It's not -- we're not increasing anything -- any debt on our balance sheet to fund share repurchase activity. We're not using operating cash flow to fund share repurchase activity. Our -- I closed my prepared comments with our plan is to grow. Well, that's part of our growth agenda. And as opportunities come forward, we will execute."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw a robust",621,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
We finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw a robust top line growth at each segment led by Energy and Fluids, resulting in overall growth of 11%, including organic growth of 6%. We also achieved solid volume leverage as 3 of our 4 segments improved margin, excluding restructuring cost. 
From a geographic perspective, we saw solid growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia, whereas Latin America continued to be weak. Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. 
In Energy, revenue growth was strong, as U.S. drilling and production customer activity was as expected. Our recent acquisition, Accelerated, exceeded our expectations, and the Automation and Bearings & Compression markets were solid. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our recent MS acquisition continued to perform well and more than offset European softness in our core printing and coating markets. The industrial platform achieved strong broad-based growth led by outstanding results in our auto-related and waste handling businesses. 
Our Fluids segment once again performed well, where continuing robust market conditions for Fluid Transfer products and improved pump markets resulted in organic growth of 9%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated very strong revenue growth of 8%, where strong Refrigeration performance was supported by shipments of quarter 3 push-outs.
Since the end of the third quarter, we have taken actions to strengthen and position our company for 2015, with a focus on our portfolio and cost reduction. We've made the decision to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent, which now have been reported as discontinued operations. While both are strong companies, these actions increase our focus on our core growth markets.
Also, as indicated at our Investor Day in early December, we took decisive actions to adjust our cost and streamline our businesses. We executed well on our restructuring initiatives and completed our planned actions in the fourth quarter. 
Specific to Energy, though U.S. drilling and production revenue and customer activity has been as strong as expected, we have been proactively reducing cost in anticipation of lower customer activity in 2015. Our acquisition pipeline continues to rebuild, though no significant deals are imminent. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and recently put a new standing authorization in place. 
Now let me provide our revenue outlook for 2015, which is unchanged from our Investor Day for Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Their markets have remained healthy, and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. 
As you would expect, the big change to our forecast is in Energy, where the rapid decline in oil prices is significantly impacting Energy CapEx spending and U.S. rig counts. As a result, within Energy, we expect lower revenue in our U.S.-based drilling and production businesses. However, we continue to expect our international oil and gas activity and our Bearings & Compression businesses to grow. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth driven by strong dynamics in our industrial platform and global growth in Printing & Identification. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for our Pumps and Fluid Transfer businesses, supported by increased Safety and Environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new product introductions. 
And lastly, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to grow, driven by our focus on customer service and best-in-class products. We expect to grow our position with many customers in 2015, driven by innovative products like CO2 systems and heat exchangers, to name just a few. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 11%. Organic revenue grew 6%, and growth from acquisitions was 7%, offset by 2% of FX. Adjust",1516,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 11%. Organic revenue grew 6%, and growth from acquisitions was 7%, offset by 2% of FX. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.01, excluding discrete tax benefits. This result includes $0.17 of restructuring and other costs.
Segment margin for the quarter was 14.8%, 210 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting costs, our overall margin was 17.3%.
Bookings increased 4% over the prior year to $1.9 billion led by Energy and Engineered Systems. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog was essentially flat at $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was $390 million for the quarter. For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $787 million, 10% of revenue or 100% conversion of net income. 
Now turning to Slide 4. All segments grew organically in the quarter. Fluids grew 9%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer and pump markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment, driven in part by shipments of Q3 push-outs, grew 8%. Engineered Systems grew 5% with strong growth in the industrial platform. Energy was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 7% comprised of 20% in Energy, whereas Engineered Systems grew 4%, and Fluids increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 2% from the third quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality. Overall, Energy grew 8%, while Fluids increased 4%. Engineered Systems was down 3% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 13%. Sequential bookings decreased 3%, principally reflecting anticipated lower orders in Refrigeration and the timing of orders in Food Equipment. In all, Engineered Systems grew 5%, and Energy increased 2% on the strength of acquisitions. Fluids declined 2%, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 20%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $550 million increased 20%, and earnings of $105 million decreased 6% from last year. Excluding the combined $19 million impact of Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings increased 11%.
Overall, as we expected, Energy produced a very good quarter. Strong revenue growth in our drilling and production markets was largely driven by acquisitions, the completion of U.S. shale projects and solid Middle East activity. Our Bearings & Compression and automation markets remained modestly positive.
We took restructuring actions in the fourth quarter, as well as additional actions to align our cost to anticipated market conditions. We remain proactive and now expect to incur restructuring costs in Energy of $13 million to $15 million in the first quarter. When the first quarter actions are complete, we will have reduced our Energy headcount by approximately 900 or 14% in total.
Excluding the Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting costs, our adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, slightly exceeding our expectations. Bookings were $535 million, a 21% increase over the prior year, largely reflecting acquisitions. Organic bookings grew 2%. Book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where revenue of $592 million was up 6%, and earnings of $93 million increased 7%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 11% to $97 million. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 4% to $248 million, primarily driven by strong digital printing results. Organic revenue grew 1%, where solid equipment sales were partially offset by a softer Europe. FX was a 6% headwind in this platform in the fourth quarter. 
In the industrial platform, revenue grew 8% to $345 million, all of which was organic. Revenue growth was broad-based with particularly strong performance in our auto-related and waste handling businesses. 
Adjusted margin was up 70 basis points to 16.4% on volume leverage, excluding restructuring. Bookings were $623 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 6% to $248 million, driven by acquisitions earlier in the year and generally solid market conditions. Industrial bookings increased 15% to $374 million, reflecting strong broad-based growth. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1, while industrial's was 1.09. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.05. 
Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter, where revenue increased 10% to $377 million, and earnings of $63 million were up 14%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 20% to $66 million.
Revenue was driven by organic growth of 9% and acquisition growth of 3%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets, increased safety and environmental regulations and share gains. Pumps was driven by healthy chemical markets and new product introductions.
Excluding restructuring, adjusted margin was 17.4%, an increase of 140 basis points, resulting from strong leverage on volume. Bookings were $346 million, a decrease of 2%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps. Book-to-bill was 0.92.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $459 million, up 8% over the prior year. Excluding restructuring of $25 million, earnings improved 19% to $56 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong Refrigeration shipments, supported by Q3 push-outs. Excluding restructuring, adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, a 130 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects improved performance and volume leverage. 
Bookings were $368 million, a decrease of 18%, principally reflecting an anticipated reduction in orders in Refrigeration and the timing of orders in Food Equipment. Book-to-bill was 0.80. 
Now going to the overview slide, #10. Fourth quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $30 million, consistent with expectations and included a $3.6 million pension settlement charge. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding $0.02 of discrete benefits. This rate was lower than in previous forecasts and principally impacted by the R&D tax credit and tax benefits related to restructuring actions. Capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. For the full year, we invested $166 million or 2.1% of revenue.
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $208 million. For the full year, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $601 million. 
Now on Slide 11, which is an update on Energy. As Bob said, a lot has changed in Energy since our Investor Day. As a result, we expect our U.S. drilling and new well production businesses to be significantly impacted by lower commodity costs. We expect this impact to be less,, but still present in our businesses within U.S. recurring production and automation exposure. Finally, we expect our Bearings & Compression and international oil and gas activity to remain very solid. 
We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 6% to 9%, a reduction of about 15 points from our prior forecast or about $300 million in revenue, with organic revenue declining 11% to 14%. The biggest change is in our drilling and production markets, primarily driven by the anticipated reduction in U.S. shale activity. Our automation forecast has changed slightly, whereas Bearings & Compression remains unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Now moving to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be positive 1% to negative 2%, principally reflecting our current forecast for Energy, as our other 3 segments remain unchanged. Completed acquisitions will now add 2%, down 1 point from our prior expectations. We now expect the total impact of FX to be a 2% headwind, a point higher than our prior forecast. 
In summary, we expect total year-over-year revenue to be 1% positive to 2% negative. Segment margin is expected to be between 17.6% and 17.9%, excluding restructuring charges.
Corporate expense will be approximately $125 million, and interest expense should be around $130 million. We expect the full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 30%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue.
Now turning to the bridge on Slide 13. Note that in the appendix is information that provides the basis of our 2015 guide. In 2015, we expect net restructuring, essentially the non-repeat of Q4 cost netted against Q1 expected cost and other onetime items, to add $0.09 to $0.10. Performance, which includes volume and price, productivity, compensation and investment, and restructuring benefits, will be in the range of a $0.10 benefit to a $0.06 decline, largely depending on volume. 
The impact of acquisitions already completed will be $0.01 to $0.03. Shares will provide $0.27 to $0.29 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and carryover benefit of our 2014 repurchases. Our share repurchase activity will more than offset the $0.18 dilutive impact of discontinued operations. Interest, corporate and tax rate will have a combined $0.07 to $0.11 impact. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $4.70 to $4.95, reflecting a $0.35 reduction to our prior guidance.
One last note. As we move sequentially into 2015, our first quarter EPS will be impacted by approximately $17 million to $20 million in Q1 restructuring charges, as well as remaining purchase accounting costs. Combined, these items will impact Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance. We grew revenue 8% and delivered 10% EPS growth. We focused on lean and productivity initiatives across the organization, and in the fourth quarter, restructured many of our businesses to be better positioned for continued growth and margin expansion.
In 2015, we will continue to execute a strategy that has served us well. This includes investing in geographic expansion, product innovation and providing solutions that increase our customers' cash flow and reduce their cost through productivity. 
Across all 4 segments, our business leaders are focused on executing these initiatives, and I'm confident we'll deliver a solid 2015. We remain focused on growth. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. Now Paul, let's take some questions."

First off, I would tell you that, I think Brad commented on this in his prepared remarks, part of that's due to just the timing of orders in our Food Equipment platform. We've got one business in the Food Equipment group that does have very choppy order rates. It's very much of a project business. That's Belvac, and I think that almost half of that 20% or 18% year-over-year decline is just associated to the timing of orders at Belvac, and there's nothing wrong with the Belvac business. It will continue to perform quite well. It's just the timing of orders. With respect to Hill PHOENIX, Scott, I would tell you that we had another record year in revenue at Hill PHOENIX. I think they had a 2% or 3% organic growth in 2014. We had a year where book-to-bill again was 1.0 for Hill PHOENIX like it was in 2013. But you see between the 2 years, a very, very different waterfall of quarterly order rates at Hill PHOENIX, and part of what you see in the fourth quarter is an anticipated product mix change. I call it a slight product mix change, as we go into 2015, and we will expect in 2015, a little bit higher weighting in our business mix towards doors, doors with -- or cases with doors and a little bit of a reduced weighting on systems. And part of that is showing up in the fourth quarter order rates. System orders tend to show up anywhere from 1 to 3 months before orders for cases do, and we're -- the fourth quarter order rates reflect that, and it was anticipated."

It is possible that this is one of our business units in 2015 that even if we're right on nailing the rig count decline of 28% -- 25% to 30%, even with that, here's one business within artificial lift that could actually outperform our expectations."

So I'm sitting here a little bit uncomfortable trying to take a guess, directionally, but there weren't any surprises, Joe, in the order rates in the fourth quarter. As we moved from the fourth quarter, as we moved from December into January, one of the things that sort of seems to incur every single year, though it's always difficult to predict when we'll deal with it, is a little bit of restocking with some customers, especially around our drilling customers, drill bit customers, and sometimes with our sucker rod customers. It is not unusual for us to see that little bit of I call it 2 to 3 week of inventory management period occur in the fourth quarter. It didn't occur this year. What we did see was it occurring in the first 2 weeks of January. There was some choppiness in the order rates, both with our drill bit customers in the first couple of weeks of January, as well as with our sucker rod customers. We get beyond those first 2 weeks of what I -- what we call the restocking management activity, and order rates have returned to the levels that we have expected here for the first quarter."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our energy-related markets as well as the increasing FX impac",649,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our energy-related markets as well as the increasing FX impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and slower-than-expected activity in our core retail Refrigeration markets. These headwinds caused our first quarter results to be below our expectations. 
We continued to take aggressive restructuring actions to better align our cost to anticipated demand, just as we did in the fourth quarter. 
From a geographic perspective, our non-energy-related U.S. markets moderated while Europe and Asia were solid. Excluding U.S. Energy markets, all regions grew in the quarter. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, our drilling and production businesses were significantly impacted by a sharper-than-anticipated decline in the North American oil and gas markets, resulting in customer de-stocking and lower order activity. 
In response, we took restructuring actions during the quarter to better align our cost base, and we'll continue to pursue appropriate cost reductions going forward. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. 
Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed very well globally. The industrial platform achieved broad-based organic growth led by continued solid results in our waste handling and auto-related businesses. 
Our Fluids segment once again performed well, where continuing strong market conditions for Fluid Transfer products were the primary driver. The majority of our pump markets remain solid though year-over-year comps were impacted by strong project shipments in the first quarter of last year. 
The Refrigeration & Food Equipment market has remained stable. We expected a slow start to the year based on reduced activity from a key retail Refrigeration customer, and volume from other customers has been slower to develop than anticipated. We expect overall customer activity to pick up in the back half of the year. 
Additionally, our glass door business has remained strong. 
Our acquisition pipeline rebuilt nicely in their first quarter and is now quite robust, and I am optimistic that we will close on several acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
In addition, we completed the sale of the business in the first quarter for $185 million and also announced the agreement to sell another for $500 million. We will use the deal proceeds to complete our previously announced $600 million of share repurchases in 2015. 
Now let me address our revised outlook for the year, which is largely unchanged for Engineered Systems and Fluids except for FX. Their markets have remained healthy, and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. 
As you'd expect, North American Energy fundamentals are having the biggest impact on our forecast. As a result, we expect significantly lower revenue in our drilling and production businesses. Several of our other businesses in our Energy segment are less exposed to upstream oil and gas activity, and thus, have been less impacted than our drilling and production business. Overall, we expect the second quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year for Energy. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth in our industrial platform and strong results in Printing & Identification driven by new product introductions and positive market dynamics, largely offset by increased FX headwinds. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for Fluid Transfer and most of our pumps businesses. Our expectations are supported by ongoing safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new pump product introductions, partially offset by the impact of FX. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we now expect a tougher year driven by lower order activity for our cases and systems. We do we expect our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform well and help mitigate the previously mentioned softness. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,290210878,790984,"Dover Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of",1532,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 5% and an FX headwind of 4%. EPS was $0.72, including $0.10 of restructuring. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.5%, 340 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 15.5%. 
Bookings decreased 11% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, reflecting weak Energy macros, softer order rates in Refrigeration and FX impacts. Overall, book to bill finished at 1.02. Our backlog decreased 13% to $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $103 million for the quarter or 6% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 6%, with broad-based growth in both platforms. Fluids grew 2%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer markets, partially offset by tough comps connected to a large order shipped last year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 7% on tough comps in retail Refrigeration and can shaping equipment. As discussed on previous calls, the can shaping business can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but the market remains solid overall. 
Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 24%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 5% comprised of 15% in Energy, 2% in Fluids and 1% in Engineered Systems. FX impacted the total company by 4% as seen on the chart. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting weak drilling and production markets, softer retail Refrigeration activity, the impact of FX and the timing of pump shipments. Overall, Energy decreased 22%. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment decreased 19%, coming off a strong fourth quarter. Fluids was down 10%, and Engineered Systems declined 3%. Sequential bookings decreased 7%. Of note, Energy declined 22% on weak market fundamentals. Engineered Systems was down 8%, principally driven by tough comps in waste handling. Refrigeration & Food Equipment seasonally increased 14% although less than anticipated. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. Energy revenue of $430 million decreased 10%, and earnings of $52 million decreased 56% from last year. Excluding the combined $29 million impact of Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings decreased 32%. 
Energy's results were significantly impacted by a steeper and broader deterioration of the North American oil and gas markets than previously forecasted. The result was reduced E&P CapEx spending and significant customer de-stocking, most notably in our North American drilling and production markets. Solid activity in compression, winches, ESPs and international markets helped to partially offset challenges in our business. 
We took additional restructuring actions in the first quarter to better align our costs. Over the last 2 quarters, we have incurred approximately $25 million in charges in our Energy segment. These actions will provide $45 million in benefits this year. 
In addition, we have taken other cost-reduction actions, which should provide an incremental $30 million in savings. Excluding the Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, our adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, reflecting lower volume and modest price decline, offset by the benefits of productivity and prior period restructuring. Bookings were $417 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Book to bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where total revenue of $573 million was up 1% overall. Earnings of $88 million increased 6%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 1% overall. Of note, organic revenue grew 8% but was offset by significant FX headwinds. These results were driven by continued strong digital printing activity and solid global markets in our core printing and coating business. 
In the industrial platform, revenue grew 2% to $343 million, including organic growth of 4%, offset by FX headwinds. 
Revenue growth continue to be particularly strong in our waste handling business. Margin was up 70 basis points to 15.4% on volume leverage and productivity. A onetime insurance recovery of $4 million largely offset incremental restructuring charges in the quarter. Bookings were $573 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 3% and a 6% impact from FX. 
Our Printing & Identification bookings decreased 6% to $236 million. However, adjusting for FX, organic bookings were up 3%. 
Industrial bookings decreased 9% to $337 million, largely reflecting the impact of order timing in waste handling and softer markets in our hydraulic cylinder business. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 1.02 while industrials was 0.98. Overall, book to bill was 1. 
Now moving to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 1% to $340 million, and earnings of $55 million declined 6%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX headwinds. 
Our Fluid Transfer businesses continue to benefit from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results were primarily impacted by the timing of large shipments to customers in the plastics and polymers markets. 
Segment margin was 16.1%, a decrease of 70 basis points, largely reflecting product mix. Bookings were $339 million, a decrease of 7%, primarily reflecting a timing of project-related orders within pumps, partially offset by solid Fluid Transfer markets. Book to bill was 1. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $372 million declined 10% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 19% to $36 million. 
Revenue performance in the quarter was essentially as expected. Our results were largely driven by reduced order activity for Refrigeration systems and cases by a key retail customer, which offset solid heat exchanger and commercial food equipment activity. 
Operating margin was 9.7%, a 120 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $420 million, a decrease of 15%, principally reflecting slower-than-anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers. Book to bill was 1.13. 
Going to the overview slide, #10. First quarter net interest expense was $32 million, in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $35 million, up $4 million from last year and consistent with expectations. 
Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 29%, essentially in line with our revised full year forecast. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the quarter. 
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $200 million. As previously communicated, we will repurchase a total of 600 million in shares this year. 
Now on to Slide 11, which is an update on Energy. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 16% to 18%, a reduction of about 10 points from our prior forecast or about $200 million in revenue, with organic revenue declining 24% to 26%. The biggest change is in our drilling and production and automation markets, and although less exposed, our bearings and compression forecast has also been revised to reflect general Energy market conditions.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be down 4% to 6%. Our expected organic revenue will decrease 2% to 4%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 2%. We now expect the total impact of FX to be approximately a 4% headwind. 
Segment margin is estimated to be between 16.8% and 17.3%, excluding restructuring costs. Corporate expense remains at approximately $125 million, and interest expense should be around $127 million. 
We now expect full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast has been reduced to a negative 24% to 26%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 1% to 3%. Energy Systems -- Engineered Systems and fluid organic forecast are essentially unchanged. 
Turning to 2015 bridge on Slide 13. In 2015, we now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be a $0.01 impact to a $0.02 benefit. Performance, largely driven by volume but also including items such as price productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.47 to $0.58. 
Within this estimate, our restructuring benefits of $0.31 to $0.33. The benefit of acquisitions already completed will be $0.04 to $0.06. Shares will provide $0.23 to $0.24 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and the carryover impact of our 2014 repurchases. 
Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in a range of a $0.02 impact to a $0.01 benefit. In total, we now expect EPS to be $4.20 to $4.40, inclusive of $0.15 to $0.18 of restructuring costs. The incremental $0.05 to $0.08 of restructuring costs will mostly impact the second quarter. 
Regarding the second quarter, we expect revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially, largely driven by seasonal increase in Refrigeration & Food Equipment and a sequential decline in Energy. 
With that, I'll turn it back -- the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces. We will remain focused on growth investment as well as investment in productivity initiatives, including supply chain optimization and shared infrastructure. 
As I look beyond the current environment in Energy, I am excited about Dover's position. We have structurally improved our cost base while at the same time, continued to invest in product development and innovation. These internal initiatives, when combined with value-creating acquisitions, give me confidence that we will not only leverage volume improvements but also deliver very strong performance.

So Q2 margins we're really not going to get into discussion on that, I mean, but as far as the year is concerned on Energy, we would see the margins continue to improve throughout the year as those restructuring benefits begin to take hold. As we said, Q2 will be impacted by further Energy restructuring costs. By the time we exit, we would expect our decrementals in energy to significantly improved. So the first quarter, the decrementals were about 39%. I would see decrementals into the second quarter slightly higher, let's say 2 points higher than that, about 41% on Energy. And then for the year, we would see decrementals in our Energy business slightly below 40%. We had previously thought that would be somewhere between 30% and 35%, but Nigel, the steepness of the curve in a downturn has been significant. So getting the cost out and holding to those lower decrementals is a challenge right now."

Now that's not the second half. I'm saying exit the year. So I'm really speaking to the fourth quarter. And I think we have a lot of confidence, not just here with Brad and myself but with the business team leaders that we can do that within Energy. Refrigeration, I'm -- I've been sort of restrained in talking about this over the past year, but I need to take the Refrigeration story back to about this time last year, the April, May time last year. And we received notice from Walmart, who has been a very, very significant and good customer for Dover and for Hill PHOENIX and for Anthony for several years that in their new global bid, we were not going to participate in the next cycle for their large-format stores. That is starting to show up in our first quarter, first half 2015 full year revenue in order activity. Nigel, the impact of that, it's -- first of all, it's not all of the business that we enjoy and appreciate with Walmart. I think last year, we did about $300 million with Walmart, but it does have an impact on this year's revenue load with Walmart up about $100 million. We have known that since last spring. We weren't -- we were not sure of the timing of the cutover or the transition, and we've been working pretty feverishly within the business to backfill and to capture additional market share from other national and regional accounts. And we feel good with that progress, but the impact in 2015 on our Refrigeration segment is about a $100 million reduction with Walmart activity, and we feel that we have back filled that with about $60 million to $70 million of new business that we have captured year-to-date though it's not showing up in our order rates."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our energy-related markets as well as the increasing FX impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and slower-than-expected activity in our core retail Refrigeration markets. These headwinds caused our first quarter results to be below our expectations. 
We continued to take aggressive restructuring actions to better align our cost to anticipated demand, just as we did in the fourth quarter. 
From a geographic perspective, our non-energy-related U.S. markets moderated, while Europe and Asia were solid. Excluding U.S. Energy markets, all regions grew in the quarter. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, our drilling and production businesses were significantly impacted by a sharper-than-anticipated decline in the North American oil and gas markets, resulting in customer de-stocking and lower order activity. 
In response, we took restructuring actions during the quarter to better align our cost base, and we'll continue to pursue appropriate cost reductions going forward. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. 
Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed very well globally. The industrial platform achieved broad-based organic growth, led by continued solid results in our waste handling and auto-related businesses. 
Our Fluids segment once again performed well, where continuing strong market conditions for Fluid Transfer products were the primary driver. The majority of our pump markets remained solid, though year-over-year comps were impacted by strong project shipments in the first quarter of last year. 
The Refrigeration & Food Equipment market has remained stable. We expected a slow start to the year based on reduced activity from a key retail Refrigeration customer, and volume from other customers has been slower to develop than anticipated. We expect overall customer activity to pick up in the back half of the year. Additionally, our glass door business has remained strong. 
Our acquisition pipeline rebuilt nicely in their first quarter and is now quite robust, and I am optimistic that we will close on several acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
In addition, we completed the sale of the business in the first quarter for $185 million and also announced the agreement to sell another for $500 million. We will use the deal proceeds to complete our previously announced $600 million of share repurchases in 2015. 
Now let me address our revised outlook for the year, which is largely unchanged for Engineered Systems and Fluids, except for FX. Their markets have remained healthy, and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. 
As you'd expect, North American Energy fundamentals are having the biggest impact on our forecast. As a result, we expect significantly lower revenue in our drilling and production businesses. Several of our other businesses in our Energy segment are less exposed to upstream oil and gas activity, and thus, have been less impacted than our drilling and production business. Overall, we expect the second quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year for Energy. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth in our industrial platform and strong results in Printing & Identification, driven by new product introductions and positive market dynamics, largely offset by increased FX headwinds. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for Fluid Transfer and most of our pumps businesses. Our expectations are supported by ongoing safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new pump product introductions, partially offset by the impact of FX. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we now expect a tougher year driven by lower order activity for our cases and systems. We do expect our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform well and help mitigate the previously mentioned softness. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of",1530,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 5% and an FX headwind of 4%. EPS was $0.72, including $0.10 of restructuring. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.5%, 340 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 15.5%.
Bookings decreased 11% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, reflecting weak Energy macros, softer order rates in Refrigeration and FX impacts. Overall, book to bill finished at 1.02. Our backlog decreased 13% to $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $103 million for the quarter or 6% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 6%, with broad-based growth in both platforms. Fluids grew 2%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer markets, partially offset by tough comps connected to a large order shipped last year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 7% on tough comps in retail Refrigeration and can-shaping equipment. As discussed on previous calls, the can-shaping business can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but the market remains solid overall. 
Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 24%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 5% comprised of 15% in Energy, 2% in Fluids and 1% in Engineered Systems. FX impacted the total company by 4% as seen on the chart. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting weak drilling and production markets, softer retail Refrigeration activity, the impact of FX and the timing of pump shipments. Overall, Energy decreased 22%. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment decreased 19%, coming off a strong fourth quarter. Fluids was down 10%, and Engineered Systems declined 3%. Sequential bookings decreased 7%. Of note, Energy declined 22% on weak market fundamentals. Engineered Systems was down 8%, principally driven by tough comps in waste handling. Refrigeration & Food Equipment seasonally increased 14% although less than anticipated. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. Energy revenue of $430 million decreased 10%, and earnings of $52 million decreased 56% from last year. Excluding the combined $29 million impact of Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings decreased 32%. 
Energy's results were significantly impacted by a steeper and broader deterioration of the North American oil and gas markets than previously forecasted. The result was reduced E&P CapEx spending and significant customer destocking, most notably in our North American drilling and production markets. Solid activity in compression, winches, ESPs and international markets helped to partially offset challenges in our business. 
We took additional restructuring actions in the first quarter to better align our costs. Over the last 2 quarters, we have incurred approximately $25 million in charges in our Energy segment. These actions will provide $45 million in benefits this year. 
In addition, we have taken other cost-reduction actions, which should provide an incremental $30 million in savings. Excluding the Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, our adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, reflecting lower volume and modest price declines, offset by the benefits of productivity and prior-period restructuring. Bookings were $417 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Book to bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where total revenue of $573 million was up 1% overall. Earnings of $88 million increased 6%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 1% overall. Of note, organic revenue grew 8%, but was offset by significant FX headwinds. These results were driven by continued strong digital printing activity and solid global markets in our core printing and coating business. In the industrial platform, revenue grew 2% to $343 million, including organic growth of 4%, offset by FX headwinds.
Revenue growth continued to be particularly strong in our waste handling business. Margin was up 70 basis points to 15.4% on volume leverage and productivity. A onetime insurance recovery of $4 million largely offset incremental restructuring charges in the quarter. Bookings were $573 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 3% and a 6% impact from FX. 
Our Printing & Identification bookings decreased 6% to $236 million. However, adjusting for FX, organic bookings were up 3%. Industrial bookings decreased 9% to $337 million, largely reflecting the impact of order timing in waste handling and softer markets in a hydraulic cylinder business. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 1.02, while industrials was 0.98. Overall, book to bill was 1. 
Now moving to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 1% to $340 million, and earnings of $55 million declined 6%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX headwinds.
Our Fluid Transfer businesses continue to benefit from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results were primarily impacted by the timing of large shipments to customers in the plastics and polymers markets. 
Segment margin was 16.1%, a decrease of 70 basis points, largely reflecting product mix. Bookings were $339 million, a decrease of 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps, partially offset by solid Fluid Transfer markets. Book to bill was 1.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $372 million declined 10% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 19% to $36 million. 
Revenue performance in the quarter was essentially as expected. Our results were largely driven by reduced order activity for Refrigeration systems and cases by a key retail customer, which offset solid heat exchanger and commercial food equipment activity. 
Operating margin was 9.7%, a 120 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $420 million, a decrease of 15%, principally reflecting slower-than-anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers. Book to bill was 1.13. 
Going to the overview slide, #10. First quarter net interest expense was $32 million, in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $35 million, up $4 million from last year and consistent with expectations. 
Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 29%, essentially in line with our revised full year forecast. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the quarter. 
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $200 million. As previously communicated, we will repurchase a total of 600 million in shares this year. 
Now on to Slide 11, which is an update on Energy. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 16% to 18%, a reduction of about 10 points from our prior forecast or about $200 million in revenue, with organic revenue declining 24% to 26%. The biggest change is in our drilling and production and automation markets, and although less exposed, our bearings and compression forecast has also been revised to reflect general Energy market conditions.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be down 4% to 6%. Our expected organic revenue will decrease 2% to 4%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 2%. We now expect the total impact of FX to be approximately a 4% headwind. 
Segment margin is estimated to be between 16.8% and 17.3%, excluding restructuring costs. Corporate expense remains at approximately $125 million, and interest expense should be around $127 million. 
We now expect full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast has been reduced to a negative 24% to 26%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 1% to 3%. Energy Systems -- Engineered Systems and fluid organic forecast are essentially unchanged. 
Turning to 2015 bridge on Slide 13. In 2015, we now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be a $0.01 impact to a $0.02 benefit. Performance, largely driven by volume, but also including items such as price productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.47 to $0.58. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.31 to $0.33. 
The benefit of acquisitions already completed will be $0.04 to $0.06. Shares will provide $0.23 to $0.24 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and the carryover impact of our 2014 repurchases. 
Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of a $0.02 impact to a $0.01 benefit. In total, we now expect EPS to be $4.20 to $4.40, inclusive of $0.15 to $0.18 of restructuring costs. The incremental $0.05 to $0.08 of restructuring costs will mostly impact the second quarter. 
Regarding the second quarter, we expect revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially, largely driven by a seasonal increase in Refrigeration & Food Equipment and a sequential decline in Energy. 
With that, I'll turn it back -- the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

We continued to focus on lean and productivity initiatives across the organizations. Through all our actions, we have better positioned Dover for both the current demand environment and for margin enhancement over the longer term. 
With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces. We will remain focused on growth investment as well as investment in productivity initiatives, including supply chain optimization and shared infrastructure. 
As I look beyond the current environment in Energy, I am excited about Dover's position. We have structurally improved our cost base, while at the same time, continued to invest in product development and innovation. These internal initiatives, when combined with value-creating acquisitions, give me confidence that we will not only leverage volume improvements, but also deliver very strong performance. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.

So you're asking about -- okay. So Q2 margins, we're really not going to get into a discussion on that, I mean, but as far as the year is concerned on Energy, we would see the margins continue to improve throughout the year as those restructuring benefits begin to take hold. As we said, Q2 will be impacted by further Energy restructuring costs. By the time we exit, we would expect our decrementals in energy to significantly improved. So the first quarter, the decrementals were about 39%. I would see decrementals into the second quarter slightly higher, let's say 2 points higher than that, about 41% on Energy. And then for the year, we would see decrementals in our Energy business slightly below 40%. We had previously thought that would be somewhere between 30% and 35%, but Nigel, the steepness of the curve in the downturn has been significant. So getting the cost out and holding to those lower decrementals is a challenge right now."

I will tell you that, with everything we're working on, with all of the cost takeouts that the teams are working on, with all of the product development activity that the teams are working on and the opportunities that they think they have in front of them here over the next 2 to 3 months, our objective is to exit the year with something very, very close to a 20% operating margin. Now that's not the second half. I'm saying exit the year. So I'm really speaking to the fourth quarter. And I think we have a lot of confidence, not just here with Brad and myself, but with the business team leaders that we can do that within Energy. Refrigeration, I'm -- I've been sort of restrained in talking about this over the past year, but I need to take the Refrigeration story back to about this time last year, the April, May time last year. And we received notice from Walmart, who has been a very, very significant and good customer for Dover and for Hill PHOENIX and for Anthony for several years that in their new global bid, we were not going to participate in the next cycle for their large-format stores. That is starting to show up in our first quarter, first half 2015 full year revenue in order activity. Nigel, the impact of that, it's -- first off, it's not all of the business that we enjoy and appreciate with Walmart. I think last year, we did about $300 million with Walmart, but it does have an impact on this year's revenue load with Walmart up about $100 million. We have known that since last spring. We weren't -- we were not sure of the timing of the cutover or the transition, and we've been working pretty feverishly within the business to backfill and to capture additional market share from other national and regional accounts. And we feel good with that progress, but the impact in 2015 on our Refrigeration segment is about a $100 million reduction with Walmart activity, and we feel that we have back filled that with about $60 million to $70 million of new business that we have captured year-to-date, though it's not showing up in our order rates."

Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our energy-related markets as well as the increasing FX impac",648,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our energy-related markets as well as the increasing FX impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and slower-than-expected activity in our core retail Refrigeration markets. These headwinds caused our first quarter results to be below our expectations. 
We continued to take aggressive restructuring actions to better align our cost to anticipated demand, just as we did in the fourth quarter. 
From a geographic perspective, our non-energy-related U.S. markets moderated, while Europe and Asia were solid. Excluding U.S. Energy markets, all regions grew in the quarter. 
Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, our drilling and production businesses were significantly impacted by a sharper-than-anticipated decline in the North American oil and gas markets, resulting in customer de-stocking and lower order activity. 
In response, we took restructuring actions during the quarter to better align our cost base, and we'll continue to pursue appropriate cost reductions going forward. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. 
Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed very well globally. The industrial platform achieved broad-based organic growth, led by continued solid results in our waste handling and auto-related businesses. 
Our Fluids segment once again performed well, where continuing strong market conditions for Fluid Transfer products were the primary driver. The majority of our pump markets remained solid, though year-over-year comps were impacted by strong project shipments in the first quarter of last year. 
The Refrigeration & Food Equipment market has remained stable. We expected a slow start to the year based on reduced activity from a key retail Refrigeration customer, and volume from other customers has been slower to develop than anticipated. We expect overall customer activity to pick up in the back half of the year. Additionally, our glass door business has remained strong. 
Our acquisition pipeline rebuilt nicely in their first quarter and is now quite robust, and I am optimistic that we will close on several acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
In addition, we completed the sale of the business in the first quarter for $185 million and also announced the agreement to sell another for $500 million. We will use the deal proceeds to complete our previously announced $600 million of share repurchases in 2015. 
Now let me address our revised outlook for the year, which is largely unchanged for Engineered Systems and Fluids, except for FX. Their markets have remained healthy, and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. 
As you'd expect, North American Energy fundamentals are having the biggest impact on our forecast. As a result, we expect significantly lower revenue in our drilling and production businesses. Several of our other businesses in our Energy segment are less exposed to upstream oil and gas activity, and thus, have been less impacted than our drilling and production business. Overall, we expect the second quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year for Energy. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth in our industrial platform and strong results in Printing & Identification, driven by new product introductions and positive market dynamics, largely offset by increased FX headwinds. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for Fluid Transfer and most of our pumps businesses. Our expectations are supported by ongoing safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new pump product introductions, partially offset by the impact of FX. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we now expect a tougher year driven by lower order activity for our cases and systems. We do expect our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform well and help mitigate the previously mentioned softness. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,290210878,791408,"Dover Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of",1530,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. 
Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 5% and an FX headwind of 4%. EPS was $0.72, including $0.10 of restructuring. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 13.5%, 340 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 15.5%.
Bookings decreased 11% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, reflecting weak Energy macros, softer order rates in Refrigeration and FX impacts. Overall, book to bill finished at 1.02. Our backlog decreased 13% to $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $103 million for the quarter or 6% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 6%, with broad-based growth in both platforms. Fluids grew 2%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer markets, partially offset by tough comps connected to a large order shipped last year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 7% on tough comps in retail Refrigeration and can-shaping equipment. As discussed on previous calls, the can-shaping business can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but the market remains solid overall. 
Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 24%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 5% comprised of 15% in Energy, 2% in Fluids and 1% in Engineered Systems. FX impacted the total company by 4% as seen on the chart. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue decreased 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting weak drilling and production markets, softer retail Refrigeration activity, the impact of FX and the timing of pump shipments. Overall, Energy decreased 22%. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment decreased 19%, coming off a strong fourth quarter. Fluids was down 10%, and Engineered Systems declined 3%. Sequential bookings decreased 7%. Of note, Energy declined 22% on weak market fundamentals. Engineered Systems was down 8%, principally driven by tough comps in waste handling. Refrigeration & Food Equipment seasonally increased 14% although less than anticipated. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. Energy revenue of $430 million decreased 10%, and earnings of $52 million decreased 56% from last year. Excluding the combined $29 million impact of Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings decreased 32%. 
Energy's results were significantly impacted by a steeper and broader deterioration of the North American oil and gas markets than previously forecasted. The result was reduced E&P CapEx spending and significant customer destocking, most notably in our North American drilling and production markets. Solid activity in compression, winches, ESPs and international markets helped to partially offset challenges in our business. 
We took additional restructuring actions in the first quarter to better align our costs. Over the last 2 quarters, we have incurred approximately $25 million in charges in our Energy segment. These actions will provide $45 million in benefits this year. 
In addition, we have taken other cost-reduction actions, which should provide an incremental $30 million in savings. Excluding the Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, our adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, reflecting lower volume and modest price declines, offset by the benefits of productivity and prior-period restructuring. Bookings were $417 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Book to bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where total revenue of $573 million was up 1% overall. Earnings of $88 million increased 6%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 1% overall. Of note, organic revenue grew 8%, but was offset by significant FX headwinds. These results were driven by continued strong digital printing activity and solid global markets in our core printing and coating business. In the industrial platform, revenue grew 2% to $343 million, including organic growth of 4%, offset by FX headwinds.
Revenue growth continued to be particularly strong in our waste handling business. Margin was up 70 basis points to 15.4% on volume leverage and productivity. A onetime insurance recovery of $4 million largely offset incremental restructuring charges in the quarter. Bookings were $573 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 3% and a 6% impact from FX. 
Our Printing & Identification bookings decreased 6% to $236 million. However, adjusting for FX, organic bookings were up 3%. Industrial bookings decreased 9% to $337 million, largely reflecting the impact of order timing in waste handling and softer markets in a hydraulic cylinder business. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 1.02, while industrials was 0.98. Overall, book to bill was 1. 
Now moving to Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 1% to $340 million, and earnings of $55 million declined 6%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX headwinds.
Our Fluid Transfer businesses continue to benefit from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results were primarily impacted by the timing of large shipments to customers in the plastics and polymers markets. 
Segment margin was 16.1%, a decrease of 70 basis points, largely reflecting product mix. Bookings were $339 million, a decrease of 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps, partially offset by solid Fluid Transfer markets. Book to bill was 1.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $372 million declined 10% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 19% to $36 million. 
Revenue performance in the quarter was essentially as expected. Our results were largely driven by reduced order activity for Refrigeration systems and cases by a key retail customer, which offset solid heat exchanger and commercial food equipment activity. 
Operating margin was 9.7%, a 120 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $420 million, a decrease of 15%, principally reflecting slower-than-anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers. Book to bill was 1.13. 
Going to the overview slide, #10. First quarter net interest expense was $32 million, in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $35 million, up $4 million from last year and consistent with expectations. 
Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 29%, essentially in line with our revised full year forecast. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the quarter. 
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $200 million. As previously communicated, we will repurchase a total of $600 million in shares this year. 
Now on to Slide 11, which is an update on Energy. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 16% to 18%, a reduction of about 10 points from our prior forecast or about $200 million in revenue, with organic revenue declining 24% to 26%. The biggest change is in our drilling and production and automation markets, and although less exposed, our bearings and compression forecast has also been revised to reflect general Energy market conditions.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be down 4% to 6%. Our expected organic revenue will decrease 2% to 4%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 2%. We now expect the total impact of FX to be approximately a 4% headwind. 
Segment margin is estimated to be between 16.8% and 17.3%, excluding restructuring costs. Corporate expense remains at approximately $125 million, and interest expense should be around $127 million. 
We now expect full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast has been reduced to a negative 24% to 26%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 1% to 3%. Energy Systems -- Engineered Systems and fluid organic forecast are essentially unchanged. 
Turning to 2015 bridge on Slide 13. In 2015, we now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be a $0.01 impact to a $0.02 benefit. Performance, largely driven by volume, but also including items such as price productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.47 to $0.58. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.31 to $0.33. 
The benefit of acquisitions already completed will be $0.04 to $0.06. Shares will provide $0.23 to $0.24 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and the carryover impact of our 2014 repurchases. 
Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of a $0.02 impact to a $0.01 benefit. In total, we now expect EPS to be $4.20 to $4.40, inclusive of $0.15 to $0.18 of restructuring costs. The incremental $0.05 to $0.08 of restructuring costs will mostly impact the second quarter. 
Regarding the second quarter, we expect revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially, largely driven by a seasonal increase in Refrigeration & Food Equipment and a sequential decline in Energy. 
With that, I'll turn it back -- the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

We continued to focus on lean and productivity initiatives across the organizations. Through all our actions, we have better positioned Dover for both the current demand environment and for margin enhancement over the longer term. 
With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces. We will remain focused on growth investment as well as investment in productivity initiatives, including supply chain optimization and shared infrastructure. 
As I look beyond the current environment in Energy, I am excited about Dover's position. We have structurally improved our cost base, while at the same time, continued to invest in product development and innovation. These internal initiatives, when combined with value-creating acquisitions, give me confidence that we will not only leverage volume improvements, but also deliver very strong performance. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. 
Now Paul, let's take some questions."

So Q2 margins, we're really not going to get into a discussion on that, I mean, but as far as the year is concerned on Energy, we would see the margins continue to improve throughout the year as those restructuring benefits begin to take hold. As we said, Q2 will be impacted by further Energy restructuring costs. By the time we exit, we would expect our decrementals in energy to significantly improve. So the first quarter, the decrementals were about 39%. I would see decrementals into the second quarter slightly higher, let's say 2 points higher than that, about 41% on Energy. And then for the year, we would see decrementals in our Energy business slightly below 40%. We had previously thought that would be somewhere between 30% and 35%, but Nigel, the steepness of the curve in the downturn has been significant. So getting the cost out and holding to those lower decrementals is a challenge right now."

Now that's not the second half. I'm saying exit the year. So I'm really speaking to the fourth quarter. And I think we have a lot of confidence, not just here with Brad and myself, but with the business team leaders that we can do that within Energy. Refrigeration, I'm -- I've been sort of restrained in talking about this over the past year, but I need to take the Refrigeration story back to about this time last year, the April, May time last year. And we received notice from Walmart, who has been a very, very significant and good customer for Dover and for Hill PHOENIX and for Anthony for several years that in their new global bid, we were not going to participate in the next cycle for their large-format stores. That is starting to show up in our first quarter, first half 2015 full year revenue in order activity. Nigel, the impact of that, it's -- first off, it's not all of the business that we enjoy and appreciate with Walmart. I think last year, we did about $300 million with Walmart, but it does have an impact on this year's revenue load with Walmart up about $100 million. We have known that since last spring. We weren't -- we were not sure of the timing of the cutover or the transition, and we've been working pretty feverishly within the business to backfill and to capture additional market share from other national and regional accounts. And we feel good with that progress, but the impact in 2015 on our Refrigeration segment is about a $100 million reduction with Walmart activity, and we feel that we have back filled that with about $60 million to $70 million of new business that we have captured year-to-date, though it's not showing up in our order rates."

I don't have the exact number, but I do know it's like 15.5% of our employee base that existed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In the early days, and I will label that as the fourth quarter, most of those headcount reductions, I would say were -- well, it's not all hourly, but it was really related to reducing output capacity that we were anticipating. So let's call it variable type of activity, and we've seen a much healthier, heavier load here in the first quarter on SG&A. The one thing we haven't touched yet, and I want to emphasize this, I want to emphasize both parts of that statement. We haven't touched and then yet is product development and R&D, and we've -- we have been, I have been, we've all been rather loath to reduce the ongoing product development and innovation work we're doing within these key businesses. As I've mentioned earlier, if we see rig count pierce the 900 level and drop significantly below that, then I would say we start to look at some other cost decisions that up until now, I have, we have been reluctant to pursue."

And that 10%, it's about half in the -- about half in North America and about half outside of North America. We have seen a little bit of that decline especially within our pumps businesses in the first quarter. We think we have that decline appropriately sized and anticipated for the balance of the year, and -- but even with that, we see strong growth potential in some of our other markets and verticals, and we've got a fairly healthy organic growth rate, not just for Fluid Transfer, but for the entire segment for the year.

I've shared with you what our objective is as we exit the year on margins for Energy, and I've told you what our objective is for the year on margins for Fluids. We continue to make very, very good progress within the businesses and the segment within Engineered Systems on margin improvement, and this has been a significant discussion with the leadership teams within Refrigeration & Food Equipment to improve the margins. And you'll see a little bit of an improvement in margins with Refrigeration & Food Equipment this year. I think we have more to do, and I would like to think as we go through 2015 and '16, you will see us execute on that objective on margin improvements within Refrigeration and at the pricing level that was being offered or I would maybe more appropriate put it at the pricing level that this order activity, this award was led at, we just found it unattractive."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Let me begin by saying that the Energy markets have been more challenging than we anticipated, and the impact on our results have been quite significant. I do believe we are taking the right actions to address the current environment, and I am confident we will improve our performance in the coming quarters. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. We faced tough markets in the second quarter, which included diminished demand and significant inventory reductions in our North American Energy markets. We also saw reduced activity tied to customer capital spending in retail Refrigeration and oil and gas-related pump markets. 
Regarding our industrial platform, the U.S. was very solid, partially offset by some softness in Asia and Europe. These factors more than offset the cost-containment actions we've been able to achieve, and the very solid results we're seeing in Engineered Systems and Fluids. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. activity declined, largely driven by our exposure to oil and gas markets. Our Asian activity also declined on tough comps in food equipment and reduced industrial capital spending in China. Overall, Europe remains solid and grew organically in the quarter. 
Now some specific segment comments. In Energy, our drilling and production and automation businesses were significantly impacted by the severe North American oil and gas market declines. We also saw some weakness in Energy-related bearings markets while our Compression business held up well. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses again performed well, and the industrial platform achieved overall organic growth of 3%, led by solid results in our waste handling business. 
Our Fluids segment had a strong quarter, where market conditions for Fluid Transfer products were solid, and we had strong shipments in our project-related pumps businesses. Fluids segment margin performance was excellent at 20%. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail Refrigeration results were soft. We expected activity to replace previously lost volume to be more robust at this stage of the year. I am encouraged that bookings improved at Hill PHOENIX as we move through the quarter. 
Additionally, our glass door business performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the second quarter, and we have the opportunity to close on several bolt-on acquisitions in the second half of the year. 
Now let me address our revised outlook for the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the weak second quarter and continuing low demand levels in the second half. 
On a positive note, we believe we are at the very beginning of a change in direction for our drilling business. Specifically, we saw drilling bookings stabilize and slightly improve off a low base as we exited the quarter. In addition, we have been actively expanding our customer base and select product categories and gaining business with new products and technologies. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate growth across both platforms. In Printing & Identification, we continue to win business globally, and organic growth should remain very healthy. In the industrial platform, we expect second half organic revenue growth to remain solid, quite similar to the first half supported by strong U.S. markets. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for Fluid Transfer and most of our pumps businesses, and margin will remain strong in the second half. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we have lowered our forecast due to reduced expectations at Hill PHOENIX. However, we do anticipate our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform quite well in the back half. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of",1318,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 4% and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $0.97, including $0.01 of restructuring. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, 300 basis points below last year. Bookings decreased 14% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting weak Energy macros and softer capital spending in retail Refrigeration, oil and gas-exposed pump markets and our industrial businesses in Engineered Systems. Overall, book to bill finished at 0.98. Our backlog decreased 17% to $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $175 million or 10% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Fluids organic revenue grew 6%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer markets. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 3%, reflecting solid growth in both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 12% on slower spending by our retail Refrigeration customers and tough comps in our can shaping equipment. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 34%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 4% while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the first quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality, largely offset by Energy. 
Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 20%, and Engineered Systems and Fluids were both up 3%. Energy decreased 15%. 
As we discussed earlier, the decline into the second quarter in Energy was steeper than expected. Sequential bookings decreased 1%. Of note, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 16% as we began to see orders for Hill PHOENIX improve as we exited the second quarter. Engineered Systems and Fluids both declined 2% while Energy declined 17%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $366 million decreased 24%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $41 million. Energy's results were impacted by the steep deterioration in oil and gas markets, most notably in our North American drilling and production and in our automation markets, where we continue to be impacted by diminished demand and significant customer destocking. However, international activity continues to be an area of opportunity for us and held up well in the quarter. 
We incurred an additional $3 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter and expect to take another $6 million to $7 million in charges in Q3 to further reduce our costs. Excluding the Q2 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 12%, reflecting significantly lower volume and price decline, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and prior period restructuring. 
In 2015, we expect to take almost $90 million of cost out of this segment, the majority of it permanent to better position us for the future. Bookings were $345 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $593 million declined 3% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 9% overall. Organic revenue grew 4%, driven by solid global markets for our core printing and coding business. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was essentially flat at $363 million and includes organic growth of 3%, driven by growth in our vehicle service and waste handling businesses, partially offset by softness in Asia and European industrial markets. Margin declined 30 basis points to 16.3%, primarily on business mix and the impact of FX. Bookings were $560 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 2% and a 6% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 3% while industrial bookings decreased 5% on softness in Asia and Europe. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98 while industrials was 0.93. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Now on Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue increased 2% to $352 million, and earnings of $70 million increased 11%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX. 
Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results reflect strong shipments of project-related orders and favorable cost. 
Segment margin of 20%, an increase of 180 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Bookings were $334 million, a decrease of 11% overall or 9% organically. This result primarily reflects softness in our oil and gas-related markets within pumps and the timing of project-related orders. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $448 million declined 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 23% to $66 million. Revenue performance was impacted by reduced volume from a key retail Refrigeration customer as well as lower-than-expected shipments to other retail customers. Also impacting results were tough comps in our can shaping business. 
Operating margin was 14.7%, a 160 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $487 million, a decrease of 10%, principally reflecting slower-than-anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers, partially offset by robust food equipment orders. Book-to-bill was 1.09, supporting an anticipated better second half. 
Going to the overview now on Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $20 million, down $9 million from last year, reflecting broad cost management initiatives and reduced compensation expense. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 29.3%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million and have repurchased 500 million year-to-date. As previously communicated, we expect to repurchase a total of 600 million this year. 
Moving to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 8% to 9%. We expect organic revenue to decrease 7% to 8%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 3%. We continue to expect the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be between 16.1% and 16.4%, excluding restructuring cost. 
Our full year corporate expense forecast is down $9 million to $116 million, reflecting flow-through of the second quarter reductions. Interest expense should remain around $127 million. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 29%. 
CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be around 11% of revenue. From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now negative 31% to 32%, a reduction of around 6 points from our prior guidance. Within this estimate, all 3 end markets have been revised downward to reflect general North American market conditions. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 6% to 8%, a reduction of 5 points, reflecting slower customer volume from retail Refrigeration. Engineered Systems and Fluid growth rates have both been trimmed 1 point off the top end for reasons previously outlined. 
Turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be negative $0.02 to flat. Lower performance largely driven by volume declines, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.92 to 1 dollar. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.36 to $0.38. 
Acquisitions already completed will be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive. Share reduction will add $0.20 to $0.21. Interest corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.75 to $3.90, inclusive of $0.17 to $0.19 of restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

We clearly have faced some tough market conditions in the first half, which will largely continue for the balance of the year. Our teams have managed well for this environment, and I'm confident they'll continue to do so. 
As I look forward, I see opportunities for improvement at each segment, which should result in better performance in the back half of the year and into 2016. 
For example, within Energy, I expect drilling destocking to dissipate. We are also aggressively pursuing share gains and expanding our international presence. 
I am pleased we've been able to grow our share in select product categories over the last year in the face of tough markets and that we're actively getting on many international tenders. I expect Engineered Systems to show growth in both platforms, and I'm encouraged by a big recent win for waste hauling equipment as well as in large Navy contract we just secured. 
Fluids has demonstrated very solid growth in Fluid Transfer, which should continue. On the pump side, we continue to grow in international markets as evidenced by an important plastics we were just awarded in China. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, I anticipate a better second half on improved order activity at Hill PHOENIX. Our food equipment businesses will also have an improved second half, boosted by stronger project shipments and new equipment rollouts for a couple of key restaurant customers. 
With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces, and I expect us to complete some acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.

Not a lot has changed. In our drilling products, it's still going to average for the year about 5%, and that's what we saw in the second quarter, a little bit more aggressive actions that we've taken along with some of the customer demands in rods, and that's probably averaging about 10%. Don't see it being much different during the second half of the year, and the net impact for the segment for the entire year, I would tell you, it's still within the range we've been sharing with you for the past couple of calls, which is 3% to 6%, 4% to 6% in that range."

But in terms of Energy, I pointed out at my prepared remarks that we expect to take $90 million of cost out this year. Steve, there's 2 pieces to that. There's a piece that's funded through restructuring. There's a piece that's just day-to-day initiatives around structure that doesn't cost us effort.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Let me begin by saying that the Energy markets have been more challenging than we anticipated, and the impact on our results have been quite significant. I do believe we are taking the right actions to address the current environment, and I am confident we will improve our performance in the coming quarters. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. We faced tough markets in the second quarter, which included diminished demand and significant inventory reductions in our North American energy markets. We also saw reduced activity tied to customer capital spending in retail refrigeration and oil and gas-related pump markets. 
Regarding our industrial platform, the U.S. was very solid, partially offset by some softness in Asia and Europe. These factors more than offset the cost-containment actions we've been able to achieve and the very solid results we're seeing in Engineered Systems and Fluids. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. activity declined, largely driven by our exposure to oil and gas markets. Our Asian activity also declined on tough comps in food equipment and reduced industrial capital spending in China. Overall, Europe remains solid and grew organically in the quarter. 
Now some specific segment comments. In Energy, our drilling and production and automation businesses were significantly impacted by the severe North American oil and gas market declines. We also saw some weakness in Energy-related bearings [ph] markets, while our compression business held up well. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses again performed well, and the industrial platform achieved overall organic growth of 3%, led by solid results in our waste handling business. 
Our Fluids segment had a strong quarter, where market conditions for Fluid Transfer products were solid, and we had strong shipments in our project-related pumps businesses. Fluids segment margin performance was excellent at 20%. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results were soft. We expected activity to replace previously lost volume to be more robust at this stage of the year. I am encouraged that bookings improved at Hill PHOENIX as we move through the quarter. 
Additionally, our glass door business performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. 
Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the second quarter, and we had the opportunity to close on several bolt-on acquisitions in the second half of the year. 
Now let me address our revised outlook for the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the weak second quarter and continuing low demand levels in the second half. 
On a positive note, we believe we are at the very beginning of a change in direction for our drilling business. Specifically, we saw drilling bookings stabilize and slightly improve off a low base as we exited the quarter. In addition, we have been actively expanding our customer base in select product categories and gaining business with new products in technology. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate growth across both platforms. In Printing & Identification, we continue to win business globally, and organic growth should remain very healthy. In the industrial platform, we expect second half organic revenue growth to remain solid, quite similar to the first half, supported by strong U.S. markets. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for Fluid Transfer and most of our pumps businesses, and margin will remain strong in the second half. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we have lowered our forecast due to reduced expectations at Hill PHOENIX. However, we do anticipate our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform quite well in the back half. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of",1317,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 4% and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $0.97, including $0.01 of restructuring. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, 300 basis points below last year. Bookings decreased 14% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting weak Energy macros and softer capital spending in retail refrigeration, oil and gas-exposed pump markets and our industrial businesses in Engineered Systems. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.98. Our backlog decreased 17% to $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $175 million or 10% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Fluids organic revenue grew 6%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer markets. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 3%, reflecting solid growth in both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 12% on slower spending by our retail refrigeration customers and tough comps in our can shaping equipment. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 34%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 4% while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the first quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality, largely offset by Energy. 
Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 20% and Engineered Systems and Fluids were both up 3%. Energy decreased 15%. 
As we discussed earlier, the decline into the second quarter in Energy was deeper than expected. Sequential bookings decreased 1%. Of note, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 16% as we began to see orders for Hill PHOENIX improve as we exited the second quarter. Engineered Systems and Fluids both declined 2% while Energy declined 17%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $366 million decreased 24%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $41 million. Energy's results were impacted by the steep deterioration in oil and gas markets, most notably in our North American drilling and production and in our automation markets, where we continue to be impacted by diminished demand and significant customer de-stocking. However, international activity continues to be an area of opportunity for us and held up well in the quarter. 
We incurred an additional $3 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter and expect to take another $6 million to $7 million in charges in Q3 to further reduce our costs. Excluding the Q2 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 12%, reflecting significantly lower volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and prior period restructuring. 
In 2015, we expect to take almost $90 million of cost out of this segment, a majority of it permanent, to better position us for the future. Bookings were $345 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $593 million declined 3% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 9% overall. Organic revenue grew 4%, driven by solid global markets for our core printing and coding business. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was essentially flat at $363 million and includes organic growth of 3%, driven by growth in our vehicle service and waste handling businesses, partially offset by softness in Asia and European industrial markets. Margin declined 30 basis points to 16.3%, primarily on business mix and the impact of FX. Bookings were $560 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 2% and a 6% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 3% while industrial bookings decreased 5% on softness in Asia and Europe. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98 while industrials was 0.93. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Now on Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue increased 2% to $352 million, and earnings of $70 million increased 11%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX. 
Our Fluid Transfer business has benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results reflect strong shipments of project-related orders and favorable comps. 
Segment margin of 20%, an increase of 180 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Bookings were $334 million, a decrease of 11% overall or 9% organically. This result primarily reflects softness in our oil and gas-related markets within pumps and the timing of project-related orders. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $448 million declined 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 23% to $66 million. Revenue performance was impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer as well as lower-than-expected shipments to other retail customers. Also impacting results were tough comps in our can shaping business. 
Operating margin was 14.7%, a 160 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $487 million, a decrease of 10%, principally reflecting slower-than-anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers, partially offset by robust food equipment orders. Book-to-bill was 1.09, supporting an anticipated better second half. 
Going to the overview now on Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $20 million, down $9 million from last year, reflecting broad cost management initiatives and reduced compensation expense. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 29.3%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million and have repurchased $500 million year-to-date. As previously communicated, we expect to repurchase a total of $600 million this year. 
Moving to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 8% to 9%. We expect organic revenue to decrease 7% to 8%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 3%. We continue to expect the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be between 16.1% and 16.4%, excluding restructuring cost. 
Our full year corporate expense forecast is down $9 million to $116 million, reflecting flow-through of the second quarter reductions. Interest expense should remain around $127 million. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 29%. 
CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be around 11% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now negative 31% to 32%, a reduction of around 6 points from our prior guidance. Within this estimate, all 3 end markets have been revised downward to reflect general North American market conditions. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 6% to 8%, a reduction of 5 points, reflecting slower customer volume in retail refrigeration. Engineered Systems and Fluid growth rates have both been trimmed 1 point off the top end for reasons previously outlined. 
Turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be negative $0.02 to flat. Lower performance, largely driven by volume declines, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.92 to $1. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.36 to $0.38. 
Acquisitions already completed will be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive. Share reduction will add $0.20 to $0.21. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.75 to $3.90, inclusive of $0.17 to $0.19 of restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

We clearly have faced some tough market conditions in the first half, which will largely continue for the balance of the year. Our teams have managed well for this environment, and I'm confident they'll continue to do so. 
As I look forward, I see opportunities for improvement at each segment, which should result in better performance in the back half of the year and into 2016. 
For example, within Energy, I expect drilling de-stocking to dissipate. We are also aggressively pursuing share gains and expanding our international presence. 
I am pleased we've been able to grow our share in select product categories over the last year in the face of tough markets and that we are actively bidding on many international tenders. I expect Engineered Systems to show growth in both platforms, and am encouraged by a big recent win for waste hauling equipment as well as a large Navy contract we just secured. 
Fluids has demonstrated very solid growth in Fluid Transfer, which should continue. On the pump side, we continue to grow in international markets, as evidenced by an important plastic score [ph] we were just awarded in China. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, I anticipate a better second half on improved order activity at Hill PHOENIX. Our food equipment businesses will also have improved second half, boosted by stronger project shipments and new equipment rollouts for a couple of key restaurant customers. 
With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces, and I expect us to complete some acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. 
With that, Paul, let's take some questions."

Just more confidence around that benefit number. But in terms of Energy, I pointed out in my prepared remarks that we expect to take $90 million of cost out this year. Steve, there's 2 pieces to that. There's a piece that's funded through restructuring, there's a piece that's just day-to-day initiatives around structure that doesn't cost us effort -- doesn't cost us money, I should say, plus a lot of effort, but money. And so Energy will take $90 million out. The run rate on that, obviously, is much more significant for the total corporation, I would say, we look for on restructuring, and I'm going to go back to just the restructuring piece, $90 million to $95 million of benefits.

Let me begin by saying that the Energy markets have been more challenging than we anticipated, and the impact on our results have been quite significa",638,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. 
Let me begin by saying that the Energy markets have been more challenging than we anticipated, and the impact on our results have been quite significant. I do believe we are taking the right actions to address the current environment, and I am confident we will improve our performance in the coming quarters. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. We faced tough markets in the second quarter, which included diminished demand and significant inventory reductions in our North American energy markets. We also saw reduced activity tied to customer capital spending in retail refrigeration and oil and gas-related pump markets. 
Regarding our industrial platform, the U.S. was very solid, partially offset by some softness in Asia and Europe. These factors more than offset the cost-containment actions we've been able to achieve and the very solid results we're seeing in Engineered Systems and Fluids. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. activity declined, largely driven by our exposure to oil and gas markets. Our Asian activity also declined on tough comps in food equipment and reduced industrial capital spending in China. Overall, Europe remains solid and grew organically in the quarter. 
Now some specific segment comments. In Energy, our drilling and production and automation businesses were significantly impacted by the severe North American oil and gas market declines. We also saw some weakness in Energy-related bearings [ph] markets, while our compression business held up well. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses again performed well, and the industrial platform achieved overall organic growth of 3%, led by solid results in our waste handling business. 
Our Fluids segment had a strong quarter, where market conditions for Fluid Transfer products were solid, and we had strong shipments in our project-related pumps businesses. Fluids segment margin performance was excellent at 20%. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results were soft. We expected activity to replace previously lost volume to be more robust at this stage of the year. I am encouraged that bookings improved at Hill PHOENIX as we moved through the quarter. 
Additionally, our glass door business performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. 
Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the second quarter, and we had the opportunity to close on several bolt-on acquisitions in the second half of the year. 
Now let me address our revised outlook for the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the weak second quarter and continuing low demand levels in the second half. 
On a positive note, we believe we are at the very beginning of a change in direction for our drilling business. Specifically, we saw drilling bookings stabilize and slightly improve off a low base as we exited the quarter. In addition, we have been actively expanding our customer base in select product categories and gaining business with new products and technology. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate growth across both platforms. In Printing & Identification, we continue to win business globally, and organic growth should remain very healthy. In the industrial platform, we expect second half organic revenue growth to remain solid, quite similar to the first half, supported by strong U.S. markets. 
Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for Fluid Transfer and most of our pumps businesses, and margin will remain strong in the second half. 
Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we have lowered our forecast due to reduced expectations at Hill PHOENIX. However, we do anticipate our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform quite well in the back half. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of",1317,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 4% and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $0.97, including $0.01 of restructuring. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, 300 basis points below last year. Bookings decreased 14% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting weak Energy macros and softer capital spending in retail refrigeration, oil and gas-exposed pump markets and our industrial businesses in Engineered Systems. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.98. Our backlog decreased 17% to $1.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $175 million or 10% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4. Fluids organic revenue grew 6%, benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer markets. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 3%, reflecting solid growth in both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 12% on slower spending by our retail refrigeration customers and tough comps in our can shaping equipment. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 34%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 4% while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the first quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality, largely offset by Energy. 
Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 20% and Engineered Systems and Fluids were both up 3%. Energy decreased 15%. 
As we discussed earlier, the decline into the second quarter in Energy was deeper than expected. Sequential bookings decreased 1%. Of note, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 16% as we began to see orders for Hill PHOENIX improve as we exited the second quarter. Engineered Systems and Fluids both declined 2% while Energy declined 17%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $366 million decreased 24%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $41 million. Energy's results were impacted by the steep deterioration in oil and gas markets, most notably in our North American drilling and production and in our automation markets, where we continue to be impacted by diminished demand and significant customer de-stocking. However, international activity continues to be an area of opportunity for us and held up well in the quarter. 
We incurred an additional $3 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter and expect to take another $6 million to $7 million in charges in Q3 to further reduce our costs. Excluding the Q2 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 12%, reflecting significantly lower volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and prior period restructuring. 
In 2015, we expect to take almost $90 million of cost out of this segment, a majority of it permanent, to better position us for the future. Bookings were $345 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $593 million declined 3% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 9% overall. Organic revenue grew 4%, driven by solid global markets for our core printing and coding business. 
In the industrial platform, revenue was essentially flat at $363 million and includes organic growth of 3%, driven by growth in our vehicle service and waste handling businesses, partially offset by softness in Asia and European industrial markets. Margin declined 30 basis points to 16.3%, primarily on business mix and the impact of FX. Bookings were $560 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 2% and a 6% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 3% while industrial bookings decreased 5% on softness in Asia and Europe. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while industrials was 0.93. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Now on Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue increased 2% to $352 million, and earnings of $70 million increased 11%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX. 
Our Fluid Transfer business has benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results reflect strong shipments of project-related orders and favorable comps. 
Segment margin of 20%, an increase of 180 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Bookings were $334 million, a decrease of 11% overall or 9% organically. This result primarily reflects softness in our oil and gas-related markets within pumps and the timing of project-related orders. Book-to-bill was 0.95. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $448 million declined 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 23% to $66 million. Revenue performance was impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer as well as lower-than-expected shipments to other retail customers. Also impacting results were tough comps in our can shaping business. 
Operating margin was 14.7%, a 160 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $487 million, a decrease of 10%, principally reflecting slower-than-anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers, partially offset by robust food equipment orders. Book-to-bill was 1.09, supporting an anticipated better second half. 
Going to the overview now on Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $20 million, down $9 million from last year, reflecting broad cost management initiatives and reduced compensation expense. 
Our second quarter tax rate was 29.3%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million and have repurchased $500 million year-to-date. As previously communicated, we expect to repurchase a total of $600 million this year. 
Moving to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 8% to 9%. We expect organic revenue to decrease 7% to 8%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 3%. We continue to expect the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be between 16.1% and 16.4%, excluding restructuring cost. 
Our full year corporate expense forecast is down $9 million to $116 million, reflecting flow-through of the second quarter reductions. Interest expense should remain around $127 million. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 29%. 
CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will be around 11% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now negative 31% to 32%, a reduction of around 6 points from our prior guidance. Within this estimate, all 3 end markets have been revised downward to reflect general North American market conditions. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 6% to 8%, a reduction of 5 points, reflecting slower customer volume in retail refrigeration. Engineered Systems and Fluid growth rates have both been trimmed 1 point off the top end for reasons previously outlined. 
Turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be negative $0.02 to flat. Lower performance, largely driven by volume declines, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.92 to $1. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.36 to $0.38. 
Acquisitions already completed will be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive. Share reduction will add $0.20 to $0.21. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.75 to $3.90, inclusive of $0.17 to $0.19 of restructuring costs. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts."

We clearly have faced some tough market conditions in the first half, which will largely continue for the balance of the year. Our teams have managed well for this environment, and I'm confident they'll continue to do so. 
As I look forward, I see opportunities for improvement at each segment, which should result in better performance in the back half of the year and into 2016. 
For example, within Energy, I expect drilling de-stocking to dissipate. We are also aggressively pursuing share gains and expanding our international presence. 
I am pleased we've been able to grow our share in select product categories over the last year in the face of tough markets and that we are actively bidding on many international tenders. I expect Engineered Systems to show growth in both platforms, and am encouraged by a big recent win for waste hauling equipment as well as a large Navy contract we just secured. 
Fluids has demonstrated very solid growth in Fluid Transfer, which should continue. On the pump side, we continue to grow in international markets, as evidenced by an important plastic score [ph] we were just awarded in China. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, I anticipate a better second half on improved order activity at Hill PHOENIX. Our food equipment businesses will also have an improved second half, boosted by stronger project shipments and new equipment rollouts for a couple of key restaurant customers. 
With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces, and I expect us to complete some acquisitions in the back half of the year. 
With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. 
With that, Paul, let's take some questions."

There's a piece that's funded through restructuring, there's a piece that's just day-to-day initiatives around structure that doesn't cost us effort -- doesn't cost us money, I should say.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our team aggressively pursued share gains, cost actions and productivity initiatives, which helped to mitigate the global macro conditions. I was pleased we were able to sign agreements to acquire 2 businesses: JK Group and Gala Industries. These acquisitions are in addition to the previously announced Tokheim deal that are expected to close later this quarter. Each of these companies offer industry-leading products and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. We executed well and were able to post solid results. Of note, the sequential rate of decline moderated significantly in our Energy segment while Refrigeration & Food Equipment's results improved sequentially. Engineered Systems and Fluids continued to perform well. Overall, Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment all posted the same or improved year-over-year margin on lower volume. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy exposure and the tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, U.S. industrial activity was solid. Our Asian and European activities slowed on reduced CapEx spending. 
Now some specific segment comments. In Energy, markets remained tough. However, I was pleased with our third quarter results as we posted an adjusted segment margin of over 15%, a 3-point sequential improvement. Our teams executed well on actions to drive sales as well as on broad cost-reduction activities. As we enter the fourth quarter, we remain focused on winning new business, maintaining appropriate service levels and continuing to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved modest organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed well in North America but were softer in China. European activities slowed, partially due to the timing of order activity, and the Industrial platform modest organic growth was led by solid results in our waste handling business. 
Our Fluids segment had a solid quarter led by our business serving the polymers and plastics market. Fluids segment margin performance was again excellent at over 21%. Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results improved sequentially. 
I am encouraged by some important recent wins for our Hill PHOENIX business, which should set us up for an improved 2016. Our glass door business again performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. 
Our acquisition pipeline matured nicely in the quarter, and as noted earlier, we have signed agreements for 3 important acquisitions since our last earnings call: Tokheim, JK and Gala. While all 3 companies serve different end markets, they all have commonality in that they each complement and expand our presence in key end markets, are highly synergistic and position us to be a more important partner with our customers. 
In the case of Tokheim, we added leading dispenser and systems business to our strong OPW suite of products. Together, we will have the most complete retail fueling solutions available for our customers. 
With JK, we had a high-growth, market-leading consumable ink business to our already strong digital printing equipment offering. Our customers will benefit from the coordination and technology sharing between JK and MS Solutions. 
And with Gala, we will broaden our position serving the polymers and plastics markets. The combination of Maag and Gala will allow us to participate in more applications than the plastics manufacturing process and thus, become an even stronger partner with our customers. 
In total, we are spending about $1 billion on these 3 businesses and acquiring about $500 million in 2016 revenue. Excluding acquisition-related cost, we expect about $0.38 accretion in 2016 from these deals on an operating basis. 
Now looking to the remainder of the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have further adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the recent decline in rig count as well as softer Bearings & Compression markets, driven by slower OEM build rates. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate modest growth in both platforms in the fourth quarter led by strong results in waste handling and digital printing equipment. 
Regarding Fluids, though we anticipate growth to slow in the fourth quarter, we expect Fluid Transfer to remain solid. Overall, we expect to finish the year with segment margin of around 20%, driven by the strong focus on cost management and productivity. 
And finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect normal fourth quarter seasonality off our lower base. However, we do anticipate our glass door, commercial food and can shaping equipment businesses to perform well. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of",1399,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. 
Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 3% and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $1.19 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 17%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for third quarter restructuring of $12 million, margin was 17.6%. 
Restructuring activities were broad-based and came in toward the high end of our prior range. Bookings decreased 12% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting tough oil and gas markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95. 
Our backlog decreased 20% to $1 billion. Free cash flow was strong at $243 million for the quarter or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we now expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 12% of revenue, up 1 point from our prior estimate. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fluids and Engineered Systems both had organic revenue growth of 1%. Fluids benefited from strong project-related shipments. Engineered Systems growth was driven by solid waste handling markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 37%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 3% while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Now turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter, largely driven by expected higher volume in our retail refrigeration markets. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 10%. Fluids was flat while Engineered Systems declined 2%. Energy decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting moderation in the rate of decline following sequential decline of 15% in Q2 and 22% in Q1. 
Sequential bookings decreased 1%, principally driven by normal seasonality of Refrigeration & Food Equipment, partially offset by strong fluid orders. Overall, Fluids grew 7%, resulting from solid Fluid Transfer activity and robust project-related pump orders. Energy grew 2%, and Engineered Systems was up 1% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 12%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $364 million decreased 28%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $49 million. Energy's results continue to be impacted by challenging North American oil and gas markets. Of note, Middle East activity held up well in the quarter, and international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity. 
We incurred an additional $6 million of restructuring cost in the third quarter and are evaluating additional cost actions as we finish the year. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margin was over 15%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. Bookings were $352 million, a 33% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $579 million declined 5% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 1%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $103 million decreased 5%, reflecting principally the impact of FX. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $228 million decreased 11% due to FX. Organic revenue was flat, reflecting North American growth, offset by a softer China and deferred digital equipment order activity in Europe. 
In our Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $351 million, where organic growth was 1%, offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was led by our waste handling and microwave component businesses. We incurred $4 million of restructuring cost in the third quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. 
Excluding the Q3 restructuring cost, our operating margins was a strong 18.5%, reflecting the benefits of productivity and completed restructuring and a positive business mix. Bookings were $565 million, a decrease of 4%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 2%, offset by a 6% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 2%, and Industrial bookings increased 1%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.99 while Industrial was 0.96. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 3% to $352 million while earnings increased 11% to $75 million. Revenue performance was driven by organic and acquisition growth of 1%, respectively, offset by a 5% FX impact. Our Fluid Transfer businesses remain solid while our pumps results reflect strong shipments of plastics-related project orders. 
Segment margin was 21.3%, an increase of 260 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Of note, deal cost related to recent acquisition activity were approximately $2 million in the quarter. 
Bookings were $357 million, an increase of 2% overall or 4% organically. This result primarily reflects strong project orders. Book-to-bill was 1.01. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $492 million declined 7% from the prior year, and earnings decreased 2% to $77 million. As expected, revenue was largely impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can shaping equipment results were improved but were impacted by a delayed shipment at quarter end, which will ship in Q4. 
Operating margin was 15.6%, an 80 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects reduced manufacturing supply chain costs as compared to last year and the benefits of restructuring. Bookings were $431 million, a decrease of 6%, principally reflecting slow order activity from our core Refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 0.87, reflecting normal seasonality. 
Now I'm going to the overview Slide #10. Third quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $26 million, down $2 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Excluding discrete tax benefits, our third quarter tax rate was 27.3%, reflecting the benefits from restructuring international operations. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million and have repurchased $600 million year-to-date, completing our repurchase plan for the year. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 10% to 11%. Within this estimate, organic revenue has been reduced 2 points and is now expected to be down 9% to 10% for the year. We continue to expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 3% and the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. 
Of note, segment margin is expected to be around 16%, excluding restructuring costs. Our full year corporate expense forecast is coming down $9 million to $107 million, reflecting flow-through of the third quarter reduction and a lower run rate. 
Interest expense remains at around $127 million. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, 0.5 points lower than our prior forecast. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will now be around 12% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 33% to 34%, a 2-point reduction from our prior guidance. Engineered Systems organic growth is now expected to be around 3%, within our prior forecast range. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecasted is expected to be down 7% to 8%, essentially unchanged from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluids growth rate has been reduced 3 points to 2% to 3%, driven principally by weak oil and gas markets. 
Turning to the 2015 bridge on Slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be $0.02 higher than our prior forecast and be negative $0.02 to $0.04. Performance largely driven by volume declines and also including $0.02 of deal costs, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits will reduce earnings $1.11 to $1.15. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.45 to $0.50. 
Acquisitions already completed will be about $0.04 accretive. Note that this does not include Tokheim, JK or Gala. Share reduction will add approximately $0.21. Interest, corporate and a lower tax rate will be in a range of $0.08 to $0.09 benefit. 
In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.73 to $3.80 as compared to our prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.90. This range includes approximately $0.20 of restructuring charges, a $0.02 increase from our last forecast and now also includes $0.02 of deal costs and $0.05 related to discrete tax benefits. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

Although we have clearly been impacted by difficult market conditions, I am pleased with the way our teams have responded and executed in this environment. We have done an excellent job pursuing revenue opportunities and winning new customers, and we have positioned our company well through aggressive cost management and productivity projects. 
As I look beyond 2015, I am very excited by the breadth of opportunities across Dover. For example, within Energy, our aggressive pursuit of share gains and expanding our international presence is ongoing as we are currently participating in many foreign tenders. The cost and productivity efforts we have taken throughout the year have permanently reduced the cost structure of the business. 
Engineered Systems should significantly benefit from their continued focus on productivity, especially the shared service initiative and by their addition of JK. I also believe our waste handling business will continue to post strong order rates. 
In Fluids, I anticipate continued strong performance, largely driven by solid results for our businesses serving the retail fueling and polymers and plastics markets. The results will be nicely complemented by the addition of Tokheim and Gala, respectively. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, expected improved performance for Hill PHOENIX will be driven by retail refrigeration customer wins and share gains and continued strong performance by Anthony. Our food equipment businesses should also be solid, boosted by the rollout of new products. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our team aggressively pursued share gains, cost actions and productivity initiatives, which helped to mitigate weak global macro conditions. I was pleased we were able to sign agreements to acquire 2 businesses: JK Group and Gala Industries. These acquisitions are in addition to the previously announced Tokheim deal and are expected to close later this quarter. Each of these companies offer industry-leading products and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. We executed well and were able to post solid results. Of note, the sequential rate of decline moderated significantly in our Energy segment, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment's results improved sequentially. Engineered Systems and Fluids continued to perform well. Overall, Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment all posted the same or improved year-over-year margin on lower volume. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy exposure and the tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, U.S. industrial activity was solid. Our Asian and European activities slowed on reduced CapEx spending. 
Now some specific segment comments. In Energy, markets remained tough. However, I was pleased with our third quarter results as we posted an adjusted segment margin of over 15%, a 3-point sequential improvement. Our teams executed well on actions to drive sales as well as on broad cost-reduction activities. As we enter the fourth quarter, we remain focused on winning new business, maintaining appropriate service levels and continuing to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved modest organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed well in North America but were softer in China. European activities slowed partially due to the timing of order activity, and the Industrial platform modest organic growth was led by solid results in our waste handling business. 
Our Fluids segment had a solid quarter, led by our business serving the polymers and plastics market. Fluids segment margin performance was again excellent at over 21%. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results improved sequentially. I am encouraged by some important recent wins for our Hill PHOENIX business, which should set us up for an improved 2016. Our glass door business again performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. 
Our acquisition pipeline matured nicely in the quarter, and as noted earlier, we have signed agreements for 3 important acquisitions since our last earnings call: Tokheim, JK and Gala. While all 3 companies serve different end markets, they all have commonality in that they each complement and expand our presence in key end markets, are highly synergistic and position us to be a more important partner with our customers. 
In the case of Tokheim, we added leading dispenser and systems business to our strong OPW suite of products. Together, we will have the most complete retail fueling solutions available for our customers. 
With JK, we add a high-growth, market-leading consumable ink business to our already strong digital printing equipment offering. Our customers will benefit from the coordination and technology-sharing between JK and MS Solutions. 
And with Gala, we will broaden our position serving the polymers and plastics markets. The combination of Maag and Gala will allow us to participate in more applications in the plastics manufacturing process and thus, become an even stronger partner with our customers. 
In total, we are spending about $1 billion on these 3 businesses and acquiring about $500 million in 2016 revenue. Excluding acquisition-related cost, we expect about $0.38 accretion in 2016 from these deals on an operating basis. 
Now looking to the remainder of the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have further adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the recent decline in rig count as well as softer bearings and compression markets, driven by slower OEM build rates. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate modest growth in both platforms in the fourth quarter, led by strong results in waste handling and digital printing equipment. 
Regarding Fluids, though we anticipate growth to slow in the fourth quarter, we expect Fluid Transfer to remain solid. Overall, we expect to finish the year with segment margin of around 20%, driven by the strong focus on cost management and productivity. 
And finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect normal fourth quarter seasonality off our lower base. However, we do anticipate our glass door, commercial food and can-shaping equipment businesses to perform well. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%.

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 3% and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $1.19 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 17%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for third quarter restructuring of $12 million, margin was 17.6%.  Restructuring activities were broad-based and came in toward the high end of our prior range. 
Bookings decreased 12% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting tough oil and gas markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95.  Our backlog decreased 20% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $243 million for the quarter or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we now expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 12% of revenue, up 1 point from our prior estimate. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fluids and Engineered Systems both had organic revenue growth of 1%. Fluids benefited from strong project-related shipments. Engineered Systems growth was driven by solid waste handling markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6% primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 37%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 3%, while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Now turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter, largely driven by expected higher volume in our retail refrigeration markets. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 10%. Fluids was flat, while Engineered Systems declined 2%. Energy decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting moderation in the rate of decline following sequential declines of 15% in Q2 and 22% in Q1. 
Sequential bookings decreased 1%, principally driven by normal seasonality of Refrigeration & Food Equipment, partially offset by strong fluid orders. Overall, Fluids grew 7%, resulting from solid Fluid Transfer activity and robust project-related pump orders. Energy grew 2%, and Engineered Systems was up 1%, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 12%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $364 million decreased 28%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $49 million. Energy's results continue to be impacted by challenging North American oil and gas markets. Of note, Middle East activity held up well in the quarter, and international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity. 
We incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs in the third quarter and are evaluating additional cost actions as we finish the year. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margin was over 15%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. Bookings were $352 million, a 33% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $579 million declined 5% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 1%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $103 million decreased 5%, reflecting principally the impact of FX. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $228 million decreased 11% due to FX. Organic revenue was flat, reflecting North American growth, offset by a softer China and deferred digital equipment order activity in Europe. 
In our Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $351 million, where organic growth was 1%, offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was led by our waste handling and microwave component businesses. We incurred $4 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margins was a strong 18.5%, reflecting the benefits of productivity and completed restructuring and a positive business mix. Bookings were $565 million, a decrease of 4%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 2%, offset by a 6% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 2%, and Industrial bookings increased 1%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.99, while Industrial was 0.96. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 3% to $352 million, while earnings increased 11% to $75 million. Revenue performance was driven by organic and acquisition growth of 1%, respectively, offset by a 5% FX impact. Our Fluid Transfer businesses remain solid, while our pumps results reflect strong shipments of plastics-related project orders. Segment margin was 21.3%, an increase of 260 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Of note, deal costs related to recent acquisition activity were approximately $2 million in the quarter. Bookings were $357 million, an increase of 2% overall or 4% organically. This result primarily reflects strong project orders. Book-to-bill was 1.01. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $492 million declined 7% from the prior year, and earnings decreased 2% to $77 million. As expected, revenue was largely impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can-shaping equipment results were improved but were impacted by a delayed shipment at quarter-end, which will ship in Q4.  Operating margin was 15.6%, an 80 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects reduced manufacturing supply chain costs as compared to last year and the benefits of restructuring. Bookings were $431 million, a decrease of 6%, principally reflecting slow order activity from our core refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 0.87, reflecting normal seasonality. 
Now going to the overview Slide #10. Third quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $26 million, down $2 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Excluding discrete tax benefits, our third quarter tax rate was 27.3%, reflecting the benefits from restructuring international operations. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million and have repurchased $600 million year-to-date, completing our repurchase plans for the year. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 10% to 11%. Within this estimate, organic revenue has been reduced 2 points and is now expected to be down 9% to 10% for the year. We continue to expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 3% and the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be around 16%, excluding restructuring costs. 
Our full year corporate expense forecast is coming down $9 million to $107 million, reflecting flow-through of the third quarter reductions and a lower run rate. 
Interest expense remains at around $127 million. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, 0.5 point lower than our prior forecast. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will now be around 12% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 33% to 34%, a 2-point reduction from our prior guidance. Engineered Systems organic growth is now expected to be around 3%, within our prior forecast range. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecasted is expected to be down 7% to 8%, essentially unchanged from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluids growth rate has been reduced 3 points to 2% to 3%, driven principally by weak oil and gas markets. 
Turning to the 2015 bridge on Slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be $0.02 higher than our prior forecast and be negative $0.02 to $0.04. Performance, largely driven by volume declines and also including $0.02 of deal costs, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $1.11 to $1.15. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.45 to $0.50. 
Acquisitions already completed will be about $0.04 accretive. Note that this does not include Tokheim, JK or Gala. Share reduction will add approximately $0.21. Interest, corporate and a lower tax rate will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 benefit. 
In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.73 to $3.80 as compared to our prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.90. This range includes approximately $0.20 of restructuring charges, a $0.02 increase from our last forecast and now also includes $0.02 of deal costs and $0.05 related to discrete tax benefits. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

Although we have clearly been impacted by difficult market conditions, I am pleased with the way our teams have responded and executed in this environment. We have done an excellent job pursuing revenue opportunities and winning new customers, and we have positioned our company well through aggressive cost management and productivity projects. 
As I look beyond 2015, I am very excited by the breadth of opportunities across Dover. For example, within Energy, our aggressive pursuit of share gains and expanding our international presence is ongoing as we are currently participating in many foreign tenders. The cost and productivity efforts we have taken throughout the year have permanently reduced the cost structure of the business. 
Engineered Systems should significantly benefit from their continued focus on productivity, especially the shared service initiative and by their addition of JK. I also believe our waste handling business will continue to post strong order rates. 
In Fluids, I anticipate continued strong performance, largely driven by solid results for our businesses serving the retail fueling and polymers and plastics markets. The results will be nicely complemented by the addition of Tokheim and Gala, respectively. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, expected improved performance for Hill PHOENIX will be driven by retail refrigeration customer wins and share gains and continued strong performance by Anthony. Our food equipment businesses should also be solid, boosted by the rollout of new products. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our team aggressively pursued share gains, cost actions and productivity initiatives, which helped to mitigate weak global macro conditions. I was pleased we were able to sign agreements to acquire 2 businesses: JK Group and Gala Industries. These acquisitions are in addition to the previously announced Tokheim deal and are expected to close later this quarter. Each of these companies offer industry-leading products and significantly complement and expand our market positions. 
Now let me share some comments on the quarter. We executed well and were able to post solid results. Of note, the sequential rate of decline moderated significantly in our Energy segment, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment's results improved sequentially. Engineered Systems and Fluids continued to perform well. Overall, Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment all posted the same or improved year-over-year margin on lower volume. 
From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy exposure and the tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, U.S. industrial activity was solid. Our Asian and European activities slowed on reduced CapEx spending. 
Now some specific segment comments. In Energy, markets remained tough. However, I was pleased with our third quarter results as we posted an adjusted segment margin of over 15%, a 3-point sequential improvement. Our teams executed well on actions to drive sales as well as on broad cost-reduction activities. As we enter the fourth quarter, we remain focused on winning new business, maintaining appropriate service levels and continuing to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. 
In Engineered Systems, we achieved modest organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed well in North America but were softer in China. European activities slowed partially due to the timing of order activity, and the Industrial platform modest organic growth was led by solid results in our waste handling business. 
Our Fluids segment had a solid quarter, led by our business serving the polymers and plastics market. Fluids segment margin performance was again excellent at over 21%. 
Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results improved sequentially. I am encouraged by some important recent wins for our Hill PHOENIX business, which should set us up for an improved 2016. Our glass door business again performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. 
Our acquisition pipeline matured nicely in the quarter, and as noted earlier, we have signed agreements for 3 important acquisitions since our last earnings call: Tokheim, JK and Gala. While all 3 companies serve different end markets, they all have commonality in that they each complement and expand our presence in key end markets, are highly synergistic and position us to be a more important partner with our customers. 
In the case of Tokheim, we added leading dispenser and systems business to our strong OPW suite of products. Together, we will have the most complete retail fueling solutions available for our customers. 
With JK, we add a high-growth, market-leading consumable ink business to our already strong digital printing equipment offering. Our customers will benefit from the coordination and technology-sharing between JK and MS Solutions. 
And with Gala, we will broaden our position serving the polymers and plastics markets. The combination of Maag and Gala will allow us to participate in more applications in the plastics manufacturing process and thus become an even stronger partner with our customers. 
In total, we are spending about $1 billion on these 3 businesses and acquiring about $500 million in 2016 revenue. Excluding acquisition-related cost, we expect about $0.38 accretion in 2016 from these deals on an operating basis. 
Now looking to the remainder of the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have further adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the recent decline in rig count as well as softer bearings and compression markets, driven by slower OEM build rates. 
In Engineered Systems, we anticipate modest growth in both platforms in the fourth quarter, led by strong results in waste handling and digital printing equipment. 
Regarding Fluids, though we anticipate growth to slow in the fourth quarter, we expect Fluid Transfer to remain solid. Overall, we expect to finish the year with segment margin of around 20%, driven by the strong focus on cost management and productivity. 
And finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect normal fourth quarter seasonality off our lower base. However, we do anticipate our glass door, commercial food and can-shaping equipment businesses to perform well. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 3% and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $1.19 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 17%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for third quarter restructuring of $12 million, margin was 17.6%.  Restructuring activities were broad-based and came in toward the high end of our prior range. 
Bookings decreased 12% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting tough oil and gas markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95.  Our backlog decreased 20% to $1 billion. 
Free cash flow was strong at $243 million for the quarter or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we now expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 12% of revenue, up 1 point from our prior estimate. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fluids and Engineered Systems both had organic revenue growth of 1%. Fluids benefited from strong project-related shipments. Engineered Systems growth was driven by solid waste handling markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6% primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 37%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 3%, while FX had a negative 4% impact. 
Now turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter, largely driven by expected higher volume in our retail refrigeration markets. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 10%. Fluids was flat, while Engineered Systems declined 2%. Energy decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting moderation in the rate of decline following sequential declines of 15% in Q2 and 22% in Q1. 
Sequential bookings decreased 1%, principally driven by normal seasonality of Refrigeration & Food Equipment, partially offset by strong fluid orders. Overall, Fluids grew 7%, resulting from solid Fluid Transfer activity and robust project-related pump orders. Energy grew 2%, and Engineered Systems was up 1%, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 12%. 
Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $364 million decreased 28%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $49 million. Energy's results continue to be impacted by challenging North American oil and gas markets. Of note, Middle East activity held up well in the quarter, and international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity. 
We incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs in the third quarter and are evaluating additional cost actions as we finish the year. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margin was over 15%, reflecting volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. Bookings were $352 million, a 33% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97. 
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems revenue of $579 million declined 5% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 1%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $103 million decreased 5%, reflecting principally the impact of FX. 
Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $228 million decreased 11% due to FX. Organic revenue was flat, reflecting North American growth, offset by a softer China and deferred digital equipment order activity in Europe. 
In our Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $351 million, where organic growth was 1%, offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was led by our waste handling and microwave component businesses. We incurred $4 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margins was a strong 18.5%, reflecting the benefits of productivity and completed restructuring and a positive business mix. Bookings were $565 million, a decrease of 4%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 2%, offset by a 6% impact from FX. 
Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 2%, and Industrial bookings increased 1%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.99, while Industrial was 0.96. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 3% to $352 million, while earnings increased 11% to $75 million. Revenue performance was driven by organic and acquisition growth of 1%, respectively, offset by a 5% FX impact. Our Fluid Transfer businesses remain solid, while our pumps results reflect strong shipments of plastics-related project orders. Segment margin was 21.3%, an increase of 260 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Of note, deal costs related to recent acquisition activity were approximately $2 million in the quarter. Bookings were $357 million, an increase of 2% overall or 4% organically. This result primarily reflects strong project orders. Book-to-bill was 1.01. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $492 million declined 7% from the prior year, and earnings decreased 2% to $77 million. As expected, revenue was largely impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid, and our can-shaping equipment results were improved but were impacted by a delayed shipment at quarter-end, which will ship in Q4.  Operating margin was 15.6%, an 80 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects reduced manufacturing supply chain costs as compared to last year and the benefits of restructuring. Bookings were $431 million, a decrease of 6%, principally reflecting slow order activity from our core refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 0.87, reflecting normal seasonality. 
Now going to the overview slide, #10. Third quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $26 million, down $2 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Excluding discrete tax benefits, our third quarter tax rate was 27.3%, reflecting the benefits from restructuring international operations. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million and have repurchased $600 million year-to-date, completing our repurchase plan for the year. 
Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 10% to 11%. Within this estimate, organic revenue has been reduced 2 points and is now expected to be down 9% to 10% for the year. We continue to expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 3% and the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be around 16%, excluding restructuring costs. 
Our full year corporate expense forecast is coming down $9 million to $107 million, reflecting flow-through of the third quarter reductions and a lower run rate. 
Interest expense remains at around $127 million. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, 0.5 point lower than our prior forecast. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full year free cash flow will now be around 12% of revenue. 
From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 33% to 34%, a 2-point reduction from our prior guidance. Engineered Systems organic growth is now expected to be around 3%, within our prior forecast range. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecasted is expected to be down 7% to 8%, essentially unchanged from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluids growth rate has been reduced 3 points to 2% to 3%, driven principally by weak oil and gas markets. 
Turning to the 2015 bridge on Slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be $0.02 higher than our prior forecast and be negative $0.02 to $0.04. Performance, largely driven by volume declines and also including $0.02 of deal costs, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $1.11 to $1.15. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.45 to $0.50. 
Acquisitions already completed will be about $0.04 accretive. Note that this does not include Tokheim, JK or Gala. Share reduction will add approximately $0.21. Interest, corporate and a lower tax rate will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 benefit. 
In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.73 to $3.80 as compared to our prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.90. This range includes approximately $0.20 of restructuring charges, a $0.02 increase from our last forecast and now also includes $0.02 of deal costs and $0.05 related to discrete tax benefits. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

Although we have clearly been impacted by difficult market conditions, I am pleased with the way our teams have responded and executed in this environment. We have done an excellent job pursuing revenue opportunities and winning new customers, and we have positioned our company well through aggressive cost management and productivity projects. 
As I look beyond 2015, I am very excited by the breadth of opportunities across Dover. For example, within Energy, our aggressive pursuit of share gains and expanding our international presence is ongoing as we are currently participating in many foreign tenders. The cost and productivity efforts we have taken throughout the year have permanently reduced the cost structure of the business. 
Engineered Systems should significantly benefit from their continued focus on productivity, especially the shared service initiative and by their addition of JK. I also believe our waste handling business will continue to post strong order rates. 
In Fluids, I anticipate continued strong performance, largely driven by solid results for our businesses serving the retail fueling and polymers and plastics markets. The results will be nicely complemented by the addition of Tokheim and Gala, respectively. 
And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, expected improved performance for Hill PHOENIX will be driven by retail refrigeration customer wins and share gains and continued strong performance by Anthony. Our food equipment businesses should also be solid, boosted by the rollout of new products. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.

And I think that this time allows us to come to grips with a little bit of what we're going to be expecting and planning for in the second half. Now to your question about margin expansion, as we sit here today, we actually see the opportunity in all 4 of our segments to see margin expansion. It will be varied, but I think we can. In our core business, if you exclude the acquisition activity -- and aside from JK, the other 2 acquisitions we've announced do have -- do bring with them much lower margins than what we have as a Dover average. But in our core business for Dover, we do clearly see the opportunity for margin expansion in 2016. You want to add any color to that, Brad?"
