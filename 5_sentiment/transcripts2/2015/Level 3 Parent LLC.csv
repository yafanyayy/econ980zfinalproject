As you can see on Slide 3, 2014 was a solid year for Level 3. I'm pleased with our execution throughout the year and the strong finish from both teams, the standalone Level 3 and tw telecom. 
At the beginning of 2014, we highlighted our focus on profitable revenue growth, improving adjusted EBITDA and generating free cash flow. We made significant progress with respect to those financial metrics. 
I'm also very pleased with the completion of the tw telecom acquisition late last fall. Since the close of the acquisition at the end of October, we've made steady progress against our integration plan. The acquisition is an important step in solidifying our place in the industry as we tied together one of the world's most sophisticated and extensive international networks with one of our nation's premier domestic networks. We are very focused on profitably integrating the organization, products, networks and support systems, and believe these efforts will position us well for 2016 and beyond. 
Integrating quickly and according to our plan is our highest operational priority for the year and we will not lose focus on those efforts. 
Per our usual process, soon it will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, and I will provide additional detail on the integration process and what we're targeting for 2015. After that, we will open the call up to your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

We performed well compared to our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Our focus right now is integrating tw telecom. In addition, we are investing for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Before I dive into the details, I'd like to start on Slide 4 and highlight Level 3's performance on a stand-alone basis for the year. Our Core Network Services revenue for the full year 2014 grew 6.1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis compared to 2.9% growth for the full year 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA grew 19% for the full year 2014 compared to our outlook of 14% to 18% growth. We generated free cash flow of $325 million for the full year 2014 compared to our full year outlook of $250 million to $300 million. Including all acquisition-related expenses, our free cash flow was $261 million for the full year. Additionally, we continue to lower our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is now at 4.4x on a pro forma basis to include tw telecom and excluding acquisition-related expenses. 
Turning to Slide 5. On a constant currency basis, CNS revenue grew 5.1% to $1.497 billion in the fourth quarter. On an as-reported basis, CNS revenue grew 3.7% due to the strength in the dollar. On a regional basis, North America continued to show good growth as CNS revenue grew 6.3% and enterprise CNS revenue grew 11%. In EMEA, for the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 0.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.2% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis or 6.7% on a reported basis. 
In 2015, as we remain focused on profitability and as contracts come to an end with the U.K. government, we expect steeper declines in U.K. government revenue. As of the fourth quarter 2014, revenue for the U.K. government represented approximately 13% of EMEA CNS revenue. For reference, you can find fourth quarter and full year revenue for the U.K. government footnoted in the revenue table on Page 2 of our press release. We plan to disclose U.K. government revenue for every quarter in 2015. 
In Latin America, for the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise revenue grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise growth in the region was a bit weaker this quarter compared to earlier in the year because of a few large disconnects in datacenter services during the quarter. For the fourth quarter, most of CNS revenue grew 7.6% on a constant currency basis or 2.2% on an as-reported basis. 
Both our voice service and other or WVS revenue declined to $137 million in the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year 2014, WVS revenue declined 19% to $582 [ph] million.
Turning to Slide 6. For the fourth quarter 2014, CNS revenue churn was approximately 1.4%. 
Moving ahead to Slide 8. Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA was $470 million. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $448 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a $10 million Latin America tax benefit. For the full year 2014, adjusted EBITDA grew 19% to $1.869 billion from $1.565 billion in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 28.8% in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2013.  Over the course of the full year 2014, we made great progress in expanding adjusted EBITDA margins from 24.8% in 2013 to 28.8% for the full year 2014. The improvement in full year margin was driven by growth in both high-margin CNS revenue and adjusted EBITDA and the benefit of the cost reduction actions taken in the third quarter of 2013. 
On Slide 9. In 2014, capital expenditures were $847 million, representing 13% of total revenue. This was in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 13% of total revenue and included some integration CapEx. As of December 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $580 million. 
Focusing on tw telecom results on a stand-alone basis. As you can see on Slides 10 and 11, tw telecom delivered another quarter of solid growth. Sequential improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by synergies, including executive management headcount reductions, reduced cost from moving tw telecom traffic onto the Level 3 network and generally -- and general salary and benefit savings as all new hires being added to the Level 3 payroll. 
I'd like to note that going forward, we will no longer be providing separate disclosure for tw telecom results. 
Moving to Slide 12. On a pro forma combined basis, total revenue was $2.052 billion for the fourth quarter 2014 and $8.123 billion for the full year 2014. CNS revenue was $1.915 billion in the fourth quarter 2014, growing 5.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 on a constant currency basis. On an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 4.8%. Also, voice and other was $137 million for the fourth quarter with a very small contribution for tw telecom and represents 7% of total revenue. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue in 2015. On a geographic basis for the fourth quarter, about 79% of our CNS revenues from North America, 11% from EMEA and 10% from Latin America. As a combined company, we have approximately 52,000 customers, of which 94% are in the enterprise segment and the remaining 6 are in the wholesale segment. From a revenue perspective, enterprise is 71% of our CNS revenue and wholesale is 29%. 
Turning to revenue results by product group on Slide 13. On a pro forma combined basis for the fourth quarter and all on an as-reported basis, we saw continued strength in our IP and data services group which grew 8.9% and represented 46% of CNS revenue.  Within that group, CDN revenues grew 7.6% and represent about 2% of CNS revenue. Transport and fiber grew 4.5% and represent 30% of CNS revenue. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 1.7% and represents about 5% of CNS revenue. Dark fiber growth was slower this quarter compared to last quarter because of order period back bills collected in the fourth quarter of 2013. Normalizing for those back bills, dark fiber grew 6.4% and transport and fiber grew 5.2%. Voice services was flat year-over-year, representing 16% of CNS revenue. And colocation and data services, which make up 8% of CNS revenue, declined 5.5% driven by some larger -- large customer disconnects in LatAm and EMEA along with negative currency effects. 
Regarding pricing. As we've said for several quarters, we've seen little change in the pricing environment. We remain disciplined on pricing for Internet services as we manage for profitability and transitioned those services from wholesale to enterprise customers. 
Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EBITDA, including acquisition-related expenses, was $469 million for the fourth quarter 2014 and $2.271 billion for the full year 2014. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $625 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $2.443 billion for the full year 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding acquisition-related expenses, was 30.5% for the fourth quarter 2014 and 30.1% for the full year 2014. 
Turning to Slide 15. For the fourth quarter 2014, the combined company spent $100 million on transaction-related expenses and $56 million on integration-related expenses. For the full year, the company spent $112 million on transaction-related expenses and $60 million on integration-related expenses. For 2015, we expect to spend roughly $50 million on EBITDA-affecting integration expenses with some remaining costs in 2016. From a CapEx perspective, we expect about $70 million of integration CapEx this year in 2015 as we invest for common Network Systems and product platforms globally. 
Moving to synergies. During the fourth quarter 2014, we achieved approximately $38 million of our targeted 200 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies, with Network Access cost synergies of $1 million and operating expense synergies of $37 million. Going forward, I'll provide an update on both EBITDA-affecting integration expenses and annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies each quarter. 
Turning to Slide 16. As noted in our earnings release, we completed several Capital Markets transactions over the past few months and will continue to be opportunistic in managing our balance sheet. Related to those transactions, we expect to incur a $40 million charge for the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of this year.  On a combined company basis, we exited the year with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.4x on a pro forma basis and excluding acquisition-related expenses. This compares to 4.8x at the end of 2013 on a stand-alone basis for Level 3. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter with approximately 341 million shares outstanding. On a fully diluted basis, including the remaining 12 million shares associated with the converts that mature in March, our shares outstanding are approximately $358 million. The company's U.S. net operating loss carryforward or NOL balance was approximately $10.3 billion as of the end of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to now focus on our business outlook, which is outlined in this slide and in this morning's press release. While we are not providing overall CNS revenue guidance, I did want to cover what we expect from a regional perspective on a constant currency basis. Our LatAm CNS revenues grew 8.5% in 2014 compared to full year 2013. We expect comparable performance in 2015. EMEA declined 2.2% in 2014. We expect a smaller percentage decline in 2015, driven by better performance in enterprise and wholesale, offset by a more rapid decline in U.K. government revenue. For reference, U.K. government revenue declined 17% in 2014. In North America, our CNS revenue growth will be a little softer than the 6.8% growth we saw for the pro forma combined company performance in the fourth quarter. This was because we had the benefit of incremental growth in 2014, including turning up the Starbucks contract revenue and some large federal contracts that we don't expect this year. With our focus on profitable revenue growth and synergy savings, we expect strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in 2015. Specifically, from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.271 billion from 2014, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 12% to 16% for the full year 2015. In addition, we expect to generate free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million for the full year 2015.  In 2014, Level 3 spent 13% of revenue and CapEx, and tw telecom spent approximately 25%. On a blended basis, that's approximately 15.5%. In 2015, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx, which includes $40 million in capital expenditures synergies and integration-related CapEx of about $70 million. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect CNS revenue to be up slightly on an as-reported basis relative to the pro forma combined company fourth quarter 2014 figure of $1.915 billion. Due to continued underlying growth in CNS revenue offsetting the typical soft sequential comparison from fourth to first quarter revenue. We expect first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA to be up slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $625 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter will be slightly negative due to the payment of annual bonuses in cash for the combined company and higher net cash interest expense of $169 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year and in previous years for Level 3 standalone, we only paid 40% of annual bonuses in cash and the remainder in shares of common stock. 
In summary, 2014 was a good year for the company. In 2015, in addition to free cash flow growth, we're focused on integration, synergies and driving pocketable revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

To achieve our adjusted EBITDA and free cash",951,"Thank you, Sunit. As I noted earlier, 2014 was a good year for Level 3. As we look to 2015, we're confident in our ability to meet the revenues, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook that Sunit described. To achieve our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook and continue driving profitable revenue growth, I'd like to emphasize 3 key priorities: First and foremost is the successful integration of Level 3 and tw telecom. Second is enabling EMEA to live up to its full potential and support the growth we believe we can achieve in that region. Third is to position Level 3 for growth well into the future. 
While we have been, and will continue to be, an inquisitive company, right now, our #1 priority is integrating tw telecom. There are many definitions we could apply to when integration is complete but by my standard, it's a multiyear process and will not be completed in 2015. In broad terms, my definition of completely integrated includes a single set of products for our customers around the globe, a unified sales team capable of selling those products effectively in our target market and our target customer verticals, a network optimized to drive high margin products to high-margin locations, an integrated operational support platform that enables our employees to deliver the best customer experience in the industry and a global workforce acting seamlessly across international borders and diverse languages to meet the global needs of all of our customers.  We've begun initiatives across each of these areas. 
As an example, this week, we completed the go-forward sale structure for the North America sales team combining the best general managers from both companies and aligning these GMs and their teams around the opportunities our global capabilities create. Effective this month, all of our salespeople across the combined company have their go forward assigned customer account. In addition, as announced last year, we have formalized our global account management structure. This organization reporting to Andrew Crouch, is charged with providing a seamless customer experience to our largest multinational customers who buy services across the globe. From a product, network and systems planning perspective, the key to our approach is the word one. One product set, one network, one set of support systems. With several past acquisitions, we've made the decision to keep multiple instances of certain systems, products and even in some cases, duplicate networks. While this approach has several benefits, it created ongoing complexity in the sales, service delivery and service assurance environment. Due to the limited number of acquisitions by tw telecom, their systems environment was much more straightforward compared to Level 3's, especially for the quote-to-service delivery process. We will be scaling those capabilities and working to move the company to a single platform over time. 
In terms of the network, we have interconnected the tw telecom and Level 3 networks and are now beginning efforts to fully integrate them as a single unified network. We're also confident in our ability to deliver the synergy savings we've discussed in previous calls. 
Turning to EMEA. You've heard me say we need to do more to live up to our full potential in that region. I believe we now have the right leader in Andrew Crouch to implement the changes needed and provide the leadership to improve our performance. As many of you know, Andrew was a principal driver of our success in North America. Since taking the helm in November in EMEA, Andrew has moved quickly to make leadership changes and is focusing the team on improving sales, delivering profitable growth and returning the region to the success we've had in the past. 
Before I move on to what we're doing and where we're investing to position the company for the future, I wanted to take a moment to discuss performance and expectations in Latin America. We've had a long history of success and have confidence in the highly capable LatAm team led by Hector Alonzo. For several years in a row, we've seen LatAm delivered double-digit revenue growth. In 2014 and specifically, in the fourth quarter, growth was not a strong, in part due to the economic environment in the region. However, the underlying factors that drive growth in our business have not changed in Latin America. And with finance continue to grow at an extraordinary rate, the need for this capacity and connectivity is global in nature not solely within the region, and as a result, our subsidy systems give us a unique product set not easily matched by our competitors, and we have an outstanding team focused on the opportunities within the region and within each country we serve. 
Turning to future growth. We believe all of the work we're doing around integration is also critical for positioning the company to capitalize on future growth opportunities. One set of services over a combined network with a standard operating environment globally allows us to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers. Whether interconnecting the customers branch locations throughout the world over an Ethernet-based IP VPN, or connecting a corporate data center to cloud service providers via Level 3's cloud connect solutions or using Level 3's advanced DDOS mitigation services to protect the company from Internet attacks, Level 3 is well-positioned to meet the complex networking needs of our customers. We remain focused on meeting the wireline communication needs of our enterprise customers, and I'm confident that as we execute against our integration plans this year, we'll continue to position the company to take market share and further transform the business on an ongoing basis. With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

So I'll start first with the question on EMEA. I think that prior to last year, our enterprise revenue growth in EMEA, excluding U.K. government, had been close to double-digit growth. It was a little softer last year and we see that picking up. We",754,"Sure. So I'll start first with the question on EMEA. I think that prior to last year, our enterprise revenue growth in EMEA, excluding U.K. government, had been close to double-digit growth. It was a little softer last year and we see that picking up. We also had a fairly steep decline in the wholesale business in EMEA last year. We think that is stabilizing in the sense of we won't see that kind of decline in the wholesale segment. So therefore, we expect better performance in enterprise and wholesale. I think the U.K. government revenue, we were hoping at this point, to win new government contracts in the U.K. government. What has actually happened, I think as you probably know from last year, with some of the cellphone tapping events in Europe, what we've seen as a business there is going to U.K. carriers, meaning principally, BT and Vodafone. So last year was a relatively stable for us with respect to U.K. government. Meaning, you saw the year-over-year decline but a lot of that happened in 2013. Over the course of 2014, U.K. government and EMEA are fairly stable. So what we are now seeing in '15 and '16 is those contracts going away, and so that's what's hurting us. So we will see the decline in the U.K. government revenue accelerate a little in 2015, which is why we are going to provide separate disclosure for that. But when you put it all together, the fact that it is a small percent of the CNS revenue in EMEA and with better performance on wholesale and in enterprise, we expect EMEA revenues to decline a little on a constant currency basis but not as much as a 2.2% decline we saw last year. In Latin America, I think that the datacenter business there is lumpier in the sense that we had some big customers there. We had some disconnect, as I said, some in EMEA, but bigger ones in LatAm. So we saw the impact of that in the quarter. We certainly feel our datacenter business and our assets in Latin America premier assets and they should be able to grow that back up again. And as we look at LatAm in general, in spite of the macroeconomic issues that we talked about, other than Venezuela, which I'll quickly touch upon, we expect comparable constant currency growth in LatAm. There continues to be a lot of opportunities, one particularly strong segment in that, as Jeff mentioned, was the sale -- the demand for subsea capacity to Latin America which has been a bright spot. Venezuela, just to touch up on that, I think that, in general, most companies are using the SICAD 2 rate, which is -- SICAD 1 rate, I'm sorry, which is VEF 12.1 to the dollar. The official rate is about 6. We've been -- we switched to that SICAD 1 rate sometime ago. Over the course of this year as we expect some more news out of the Venezuelan government which should reconcile SICAD 1 rate, which is at VEF 12 vs the SICAD 2 rate, which is at VEF 50.  So sometime later in the year, we'll have to address that as the government moves in that direction. But away from that, generally, we expect similar growth in LatAm that we saw last year. And then I think your question on currency and in EBITDA. Look, I think the bad news is the dollar a lot of business outside the U.S.. The good news is, less than -- about 20% of our CNS revenues are outside the U.S. A lot of strength in the dollar has already happened, so we certainly factored that into our outlook for EBITDA. So we feel very confident about the EBITDA outlook that we have provided given current exchange rates. Obviously, if the dollar strengthens some more, that could impact us on margin. But on the EBITDA level, we are more or better hedged, I would say, or have less exposure than the revenue side. As we've explained in the past, our biggest exposure from an EBITDA perspective is the Brazilian real and the euro. Not as much the sterling. We are profitable in U.K, but we also our regional headquarters. So we have a fair amount of sterling expense in the U.K.. And at this point, I think, we factored in -- we're assuming currency rates that are in effect right now for our outlook. So we feel quite confident about EBITDA."

Obviously, there are opportunities for us to do that later in the year. I think my summary is when we do them, it depends on interest rates at the time and timing. I don't see it impacting -- it certainly impacts our run rate interest expense on a go-forward basis, might have not as much impact within the year. So I think there are opportunities for us, we have about $1.5 billion of callable debt with coupons in the 8 [ph] so  that's certainly an opportunity for us later in the year. They're not callable currently, so I think these are more second half of the year type opportunities depending on where interest rates are at that time."

So it's easier for our employees to do their job and satisfy our customers better. We're trying to make sure that we continue to evolve our network. If you look at our Ethernet product, we have different platforms around the globe in which we deliver the Ethernet service. We are moving to a single platform and we'll be able to deliver a unit -- a uniform product across the globe wherever the customers are located. And also, a uniform system for employees to use and deliver that product.

We've gone through and changed our channel structures somewhat, moving some things inside sales, some things to the GAM, global account management team. And so, we've aligned that structure and we've gone through and made it clear to every single sales employee what accounts they have. We have a lot of change going on. All of that is a lot in addition, we're going to synchronize compensation plans and other things throughout the next few quarters. So there's a lot of opportunity in the integration of our sales team and making sure that we're in a position to sell our global capabilities in North America and in EMEA and in Latin America. With respect to systems. As you might imagine, Frank, we have a fairly robust and complicated roadmap for our various systems. Some things -- our ERP, we are standardizing ERP should be finished by the end of the year where we are globally operating on a single platform moving that towards the Level 3 systems that we've used. On the customer relationship management, we have a single platform we're moving to. That should be in a relatively short time frame so that our sales team can use a common platform and that we can interface with that through the rest of our systems. Now if you look at our platforms, I mentioned the Ethernet platform. But we are very actively and aggressively looking at our Ethernet platform, our IP VPN platform, our Internet services platforms and making sure that we synchronize those and build the product sets and then the network to deliver those fairly quickly. So there are a number of different initiatives that we have underway across all of those things and hopefully, that gives you a feel for it."

When there were global deals in the mix, they tended not to will not all, and probably didn't even bid on many of those. So we'll see them -- that side of our business move up market a little bit from customers. If you look from the Level 3 side, the customer base probably stays the same. But our product capabilities improved. If you look at the 30,000 buildings that tw telecom had, we had very little overlap in those buildings in the Level 3. We now have a bigger footprint to sell our products and services to those customers. We know that when we sell on-net, it's better margin for us, it's better experience to the customer. It's easier for us to deliver services and maintain those services in a more reliable fashion that we have -- then when we have to use offset providers. And I touched on some of the product benefits already with respect to Constellation and the capabilities that brings to us, our CDN and the capabilities that brings to our other side of the tw telecom business."

We've seen, through my comment earlier on the churn, we've seen that that's working so far because that's the first indicator if a salesperson loses confidence in their ability to sell at Level 3, then they will leave us. And if we look at our top performers, churn is down. If we look at the average salesforce, churn is about the same as it was prior to the acquisition. And so we have a lot of change going on, but we're very confident about it and working very hard and very closely with the team to make sure that we are focused on the things that will drive our growth and drive our success in that integration. With respect to net neutrality and CDN, we'll -- let's wait and see. I don't want to speculate too much on where things might go to. But in general, we're pleased that the regulators are recognizing that interconnection is a bigger part of net neutrality than anything else, and we think that we're moving in the right direction. If we talk about dispute mechanisms, if you have a dispute with a local monopoly provider where you can have a process for resolving some of these issues. So we'll see where they turn out.

So that'll be next year's question to study. This year, we're just focused on getting integrating tw telecom, hitting on the synergies, hitting our free cash flow targets. And as we indicated, our net debt-to-EBITDA target is at the low end of 3 to 5x. We think that a lot of that will come from adjusted EBITDA growth. We do see strong EBITDA growth this year and also next year, so I think that the combination of that should get us there even without any debt pay downs.

In any particular good year, it's tough to predict what happens for all the reason that you've mentioned, that we talk about, and I would say that this year is not different from any other year with that -- from that perspective.

I won't go into a lot of the specific changes that Andrew is making, but he is making changes in the sales organization for enterprise, he's making changes in the strategy organization, the product organizations and continuing to look at how we serve our customers over there and improving our operations and all of the different things. If you look at Andrew's background just for a minute. A few [ph] years ago he ran our wholesale business. Sunit talked about North America wholesale performance this year. If you look at the challenge in EMEA, wholesale's been a big challenge for us in the last year. And so Andrew's ability and proven track record of working with wholesale customers and understanding the wholesale business and delivering wholesale result is something that I have high confidence in. If you look at where we're making progress in EMEA but we wanted to be better is on our enterprise. We've made good progress in selling to enterprise customers last year. But we do -- we think we can do better. And if you look at Andrew's background and history over the last couple of years in running North America, we've made tremendous progress in our ability to sell to enterprise customers. And so looking at Andrew and his background and the track record that he brings, I'm very confident in our ability to do some of the things that we've talked about. When it comes to the U.K. government, I have less confidence, and Sunit reflected that in our outlook. And I think that has as much to do with the buying pattern of the U.K. government. We thought a couple of years ago that they were going to change the way they bought and buy pieces from different carriers. It turns out that they tend to buy full breadth solutions, including a whole bunch of things that we don't do. They want to have full solutions from some of their providers. And so I think there's less opportunity for Andrew to make a huge difference in the U.K. government. But if you look at what we've done in North America and again, Andrew is responsible -- was a key driver in what we've done with the U.S. government, we've been very successful at getting into the business, starting small and growing and growing and growing our importance to the customer. And so I think that we will continue to do that. If you look at our network and our capabilities in Europe, we have a good network. We have good capabilities. We're continuing to introduce products and standardizing those products. And so I think that we have good opportunities in Europe. And again, one of the 3 key priorities from our company this year is to make sure that we live up to our potential. I want to -- before we end the call, I'd like to leave you all with a few thoughts. We are highly focused on the successful integration of tw telecom. We're focused on improving our performance in EMEA, and believe that we have the right leader in place and the right team in place to drive the results. We've reached the transformational point in our company's history in terms of free cash flow generation. And while 2015 is somewhat of a transitional year, we expect to significantly improve free cash flow and we remain focused on driving profitable growth and free cash flow per share.

As you can see on Slide 3, 2014 was a solid year for Level 3. I'm pleased with our execution throughout the year and the strong finish from both teams, the stand-alone Level 3 and tw telecom. 
At the beginning of 2014, we highlighted our focus on profitable revenue growth, improving adjusted EBITDA and generating free cash flow. We made significant progress with respect to those financial metrics. 
I'm also very pleased with the completion of the tw telecom acquisition late last fall. Since the close of the acquisition at the end of October, we've made steady progress against our integration plans. The acquisition is an important step in solidifying our place in the industry as we tied together one of the world's most sophisticated and extensive international networks with one of our nation's premier domestic networks. We are very focused on properly integrating the organization, products, networks and support systems, and believe these efforts will position us well for 2016 and beyond. 
Integrating quickly and according to our plans is our highest operational priority for the year and we will not lose focus on those efforts. 
Per our usual process, Sunit will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, then I will provide additional detail on the integration process and what we're targeting for 2015. After that, we will open the call up to your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

We performed well compared to our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Our focus right now is integrating tw telecom. In addition, we are investing for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Before I dive into the details, I'd like to start on Slide 4 and highlight Level 3's performance on a stand-alone basis for the year. Our Core Network Services revenue for the full year 2014 grew 6.1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis compared to 2.9% growth for the full year 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA grew 19% for the full year 2014 compared to our outlook of 14% to 18% growth. We generated free cash flow of $325 million for the full year 2014 compared to our full year outlook of $250 million to $300 million. Including all acquisition-related expenses, our free cash flow was $261 million for the full year. Additionally, we continue to lower our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is now at 4.4x on a pro forma basis to include tw telecom and excluding acquisition-related expenses. 
Turning to Slide 5. On a constant currency basis, CNS revenue grew 5.1% to $1.497 billion in the fourth quarter. On an as-reported basis, CNS revenue grew 3.7% due to the strength in the dollar. On a regional basis, North America continued to show good growth as CNS revenue grew 6.3% and enterprise CNS revenue grew 11%. In EMEA, for the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 0.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.2% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis or 6.7% on a reported basis. 
In 2015, as we remain focused on profitability and as contracts come to an end with the U.K. government, we expect steeper declines in U.K. government revenue. As of the fourth quarter 2014, revenue for the U.K. government represented approximately 13% of EMEA CNS revenue. For reference, you can find fourth quarter and full year revenue for the U.K. government footnoted in the revenue table on Page 2 of our press release. We plan to disclose U.K. government revenue for every quarter in 2015. 
In Latin America, for the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise revenue grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise growth in the region was a bit weaker this quarter compared to earlier in the year because of a few large disconnects in datacenter services during the quarter. For the fourth quarter, wholesale CNS revenue grew 7.6% on a constant currency basis or 2.2% on an as-reported basis. 
Wholesale voice services and other or WVS revenue declined to $137 million in the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year 2014, WVS revenue declined 19% to $582 million.
Turning to Slide 6. For the fourth quarter 2014, CNS revenue churn was approximately 1.4%. 
Moving ahead to Slide 8. Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA was $470 million. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $448 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a $10 million Latin America tax benefit. For the full year 2014, adjusted EBITDA grew 19% to $1.869 billion from $1.565 billion in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 28.8% in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2013. Over the course of the full year 2014, we made great progress in expanding adjusted EBITDA margins from 24.8% in 2013 to 28.8% for the full year 2014. The improvement in full year margin was driven by growth in both high-margin CNS revenue and adjusted EBITDA and the benefit of the cost reduction actions taken in the third quarter of 2013. 
On Slide 9. In 2014, capital expenditures were $847 million, representing 13% of total revenue. This was in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 13% of total revenue and included some integration CapEx. As of December 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $580 million. 
Focusing on tw telecom results on a stand-alone basis. As you can see on Slides 10 and 11, tw telecom delivered another quarter of solid growth. Sequential improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by synergies, including executive management headcount reductions, reduced cost from moving tw telecom traffic onto the Level 3 network and generally -- general salary and benefit savings as all new hires being added to the Level 3 payroll. I'd like to note that going forward, we will no longer be providing separate disclosure for tw telecom results. 
Moving to Slide 12. On a pro forma combined basis, total revenue was $2.052 billion for the fourth quarter 2014 and $8.123 billion for the full year 2014. CNS revenue was $1.915 billion in the fourth quarter 2014, growing 5.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 on a constant currency basis. On an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 4.8%. Wholesale voice and other was $137 million for the fourth quarter with a very small contribution for tw telecom and represents 7% of total revenue. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue in 2015. On a geographic basis for the fourth quarter, about 79% of our CNS revenues from North America, 11% from EMEA and 10% from Latin America. As a combined company, we have approximately 52,000 customers, of which 94% are in the enterprise segment and the remaining 6 are in the wholesale segment. From a revenue perspective, enterprise is 71% of our CNS revenue and wholesale is 29%. 
Turning to revenue results by product group on Slide 13. On a pro forma combined basis for the fourth quarter and all on an as-reported basis, we saw continued strength in our IP and data services group, which grew 8.9% and represented 46% of CNS revenue. Within that group, CDN revenues grew 7.6% and represent about 2% of CNS revenue. Transport and fiber grew 4.5% and represent 30% of CNS revenue. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 1.7% and represents about 5% of CNS revenue. Dark fiber growth was slower this quarter compared to last quarter because of out-of-period back bills collected in the fourth quarter of 2013. Normalizing for those back bills, dark fiber grew 6.4% and transport and fiber grew 5.2%. Voice services was flat year-over-year, representing 16% of CNS revenue. And colocation and data services, which make up 8% of CNS revenue, declined 5.5% driven by some larger -- large customer disconnects in LatAm and EMEA along with negative currency effects. 
Regarding pricing. As we've said for several quarters, we've seen little change in the pricing environment. We remain disciplined on pricing for Internet services as we manage for profitability and transition those services from wholesale to enterprise customers. 
Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EBITDA, including acquisition-related expenses, was $469 million for the fourth quarter 2014 and $2.271 billion for the full year 2014. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $625 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $2.443 billion for the full year 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding acquisition-related expenses, was 30.5% for the fourth quarter 2014 and 30.1% for the full year 2014. 
Turning to Slide 15. For the fourth quarter 2014, the combined company spent $100 million on transaction-related expenses and $56 million on integration-related expenses. For the full year, the company spent $112 million on transaction-related expenses and $60 million on integration-related expenses. For 2015, we expect to spend roughly $50 million on EBITDA-affecting integration expenses with some remaining costs in 2016. From a CapEx perspective, we expect about $70 million of integration CapEx this year in 2015 as we invest for common network systems and product platforms globally. 
Moving to synergies. During the fourth quarter 2014, we achieved approximately $38 million of our targeted 200 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies, with Network Access cost synergies of $1 million and operating expense synergies of $37 million. Going forward, I'll provide an update on both EBITDA-affecting integration expenses and annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies each quarter. 
Turning to Slide 16. As noted in our earnings release, we completed several capital markets transactions over the past few months and will continue to be opportunistic in managing our balance sheet. Related to those transactions, we expect to incur a $40 million charge for the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of this year. On a combined-company basis, we exited the year with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.4x on a pro forma basis and excluding acquisition-related expenses. This compares to 4.8x at the end of 2013 on a stand-alone basis for Level 3. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter with approximately 341 million shares outstanding. On a fully diluted basis, including the remaining 12 million shares associated with the converts that mature in March, our shares outstanding are approximately $358 million. The company's U.S. net operating loss carryforward or NOL balance was approximately $10.3 billion as of the end of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to now focus on our business outlook, which is outlined in this slide and in this morning's press release. While we are not providing overall CNS revenue guidance, I did want to cover what we expect from a regional perspective on a constant currency basis. Our LatAm CNS revenues grew 8.5% in 2014 compared to full year 2013. We expect comparable performance in 2015. EMEA declined 2.2% in 2014. We expect a smaller percentage decline in 2015, driven by better performance in enterprise and wholesale, offset by a more rapid decline in U.K. government revenue. For reference, U.K. government revenue declined 17% in 2014. In North America, our CNS revenue growth will be a little softer than the 6.8% growth we saw for the pro forma combined company performance in the fourth quarter. This is because we had the benefit of incremental growth in 2014, including turning up the Starbucks contract revenue and some large federal contracts that we don't expect this year. With our focus on profitable revenue growth and synergy savings, we expect strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in 2015. Specifically, from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.271 billion from 2014, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 12% to 16% for the full year 2015. In addition, we expect to generate free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million for the full year 2015. In 2014, Level 3 spent 13% of revenue and CapEx, and tw telecom spent approximately 25%. On a blended basis, that's approximately 15.5%. In 2015, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx, which includes $40 million in capital expenditure synergies and integration-related CapEx of about $70 million. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect CNS revenue to be up slightly on an as-reported basis relative to the pro forma combined company fourth quarter 2014 figure of $1.915 billion, due to a continued underlying growth in CNS revenue offsetting the typical soft sequential comparison from fourth to first quarter revenue. We expect first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA to be up slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $625 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter will be slightly negative due to the payment of annual bonuses in cash for the combined company and higher net cash interest expense of $169 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year and in previous years for Level 3 stand-alone, we only paid 40% of annual bonuses in cash and the remainder in shares of common stock. 
In summary, 2014 was a good year for the company. In 2015, in addition to free cash flow growth, we're focused on integration, synergies and driving profitable revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As we look to 2015, we're confident in our ability to meet the revenues, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook that Sunit described. To achieve our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook and continue driving profitable revenue growth, I'd like to emphasize 3 key priorities: First and foremost is the successful integration of Level 3 and tw telecom. Second is enabling EMEA to live up to its full potential and support the growth we believe we can achieve in that region. Third is to position Level 3 for growth well into the future. 
While we have been and will continue to be an inquisitive company, right now, our #1 priority is integrating tw telecom. There are many definitions we could apply to when integration is complete but by my standard, it's a multiyear process and will not be completed in 2015. In broad terms, my definition of completely integrated includes a single set of products for our customers around the globe, a unified sales team capable of selling those products effectively in our target market and our target customer verticals, a network optimized to drive high-margin products to high-margin locations, an integrated operational support platform that enables our employees to deliver the best customer experience in the industry and a global workforce acting seamlessly across international borders and diverse languages to meet the global needs of all of our customers. We've begun initiatives across each of these areas. 
As an example, this week, we completed the go-forward sale structure for the North America sales team, combining the best general managers from both companies and aligning these GMs and their teams around the opportunities our global capabilities create. Effective this month, all of our salespeople across the combined company have their go-forward assigned customer accounts. In addition, as announced last year, we've formalized our global account management structure. This organization, reporting to Andrew Crouch, is charged with providing a seamless customer experience to our largest multinational customers who buy services across the globe. From a product, network and systems planning perspective, the key to our approach is the word one: One product set, one network, one set of support systems. With several past acquisitions, we've made the decision to keep multiple instances of certain systems, products and even in some cases, duplicate networks. While this approach has several benefits, it created ongoing complexity in the sales, service delivery and service assurance environments. Due to the limited number of acquisitions by tw telecom, their systems environment was much more straightforward compared to Level 3's, especially for the quote-to-service delivery process. We will be scaling those capabilities and working to move the company to a single platform over time. 
In terms of the network, we have interconnected the tw telecom and Level 3 networks and are now beginning efforts to fully integrate them as a single unified network. We're also confident in our ability to deliver the synergy savings we've discussed in previous calls. 
Turning to EMEA. You've heard me say we need to do more to live up to our full potential in that region. I believe we now have the right leader in Andrew Crouch to implement the changes needed and provide the leadership to improve our performance. As many of you know, Andrew was a principal driver of our success in North America. Since taking the helm in November in EMEA, Andrew has moved quickly to make leadership changes and is focusing the team on improving sales, delivering profitable growth and returning the region to the success we've had in the past. 
Before I move on to what we're doing and where we're investing to position the company for the future, I wanted to take a moment to discuss performance and expectations in Latin America. We've had a long history of success and have confidence in the highly capable LatAm team led by Hector Alonzo. For several years in a row, we've seen LatAm delivered double-digit revenue growth. In 2014 and specifically the fourth quarter, growth was not as strong, in part due to the economic environment in the region. However, the underlying factors that drive growth in our business have not changed in Latin America. And with finance continue to grow at an extraordinary rate, the need for this capacity and connectivity is global in nature, not solely within the region, and as a result, our subsea systems give us a unique product set not easily matched by our competitors, and we have an outstanding team focused on the opportunities within the region and within each country we serve. 
Turning to future growth. We believe all of the work we're doing around integration is also critical for positioning the company to capitalize on future growth opportunities. One set of services over a combined network with a standard operating environment globally allows us to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers. Whether interconnecting a customer's branch locations throughout the world over an Ethernet-based IP VPN, or connecting a corporate datacenter to cloud service providers via Level 3's Cloud Connect Solutions or using Level 3's advanced DDoS mitigation services to protect the company from Internet attacks, Level 3 is well-positioned to meet the complex networking needs of our customers. We remain focused on meeting the wireline communication needs of our enterprise customers, and I'm confident that as we execute against our integration plans this year, we'll continue to position the company to take market share and further transform the business on an ongoing basis. With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

On your geographic outlook, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about -- a little bit of more detail about the European strength that you are seeing on the enterprise side of the equation, and I thought we were sort of behind some of the U.K. government stuff, but that seems like that's coming back in. Also on the LatAm side of the equation, maybe just talk about what you saw on those datacenter disconnection and where those were going in your comfort around the 2015 guide.

30771,281156507,754610,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Sure. So I'll start first with the question on EMEA. I think that prior to last year, our enterprise revenue growth in EMEA, excluding U.K. government, had been close to double-digit growth. It was a little softer last year and we see that picking up. We",768,"Sure. So I'll start first with the question on EMEA. I think that prior to last year, our enterprise revenue growth in EMEA, excluding U.K. government, had been close to double-digit growth. It was a little softer last year and we see that picking up. We also had a fairly steep decline in the wholesale business in EMEA last year. We think that is stabilizing in the sense of we won't see that kind of decline in the wholesale segment. So therefore, we expect better performance in enterprise and wholesale. I think the U.K. government revenue, we were hoping at this point, to win new government contracts in the U.K. government. What has actually happened, I think as you probably know from last year, with some of the cell-phone-tapping events in Europe, what we've seen as a business there is going to U.K. carriers, meaning principally, BT and Vodafone. So last year was a relatively stable year for us with respect to U.K. government. Meaning, you saw the year-over-year decline, but a lot of that happened in 2013. Over the course of 2014, our U.K. government and EMEA are fairly stable. So what we are now seeing in '15 and '16 is those contracts are going away, and so that's what's hurting us. So we will see the decline in the U.K. government revenue accelerate a little in 2015, which is why we are going to provide separate disclosure for that. But when you put it all together, the fact that it is a small percent of the CNS revenue in EMEA and with better performance on wholesale and in enterprise, we expect EMEA revenues to decline a little on a constant currency basis, but not as much as a 2.2% decline we saw last year. In Latin America, I think that the datacenter business there is lumpier in the sense that we had some big customers there. We had some disconnects, as I said, some in EMEA, but the bigger ones in LatAm. So we saw the impact of that in the quarter. We certainly feel our datacenter business and our assets in Latin America premier assets and they should be able to grow that back up again. And as we look at LatAm in general, in spite of the macroeconomic issues that we talked about, other than Venezuela, which I'll quickly touch upon, we expect comparable constant currency growth in LatAm. There continues to be a lot of opportunities, one particularly strong segment within that, as Jeff mentioned, was the sale -- the demand for subsea capacity to Latin America, which has been a bright spot. Venezuela, just to touch up on that, I think that, in general, most companies are using the SICAD 2 rate, which is -- SICAD 1 rate, I'm sorry, which is VEF 12.1 to the dollar. The official rate is about 6. We've been -- we switched to that SICAD 1 rate sometime ago. Over the course of this year as we expect some more news out of the Venezuelan government, which would reconcile the SICAD 1 rate, which is at VEF 12 versus the SICAD 2 rate, which is at VEF 50. So sometime later in the year, we'll have to address that as the government moves in that direction. But away from that, I think, generally, we expect similar growth in LatAm that we saw last year. And then I think your question on currency and in EBITDA. Look, I think the bad news is the dollar spent a lot to keep [ph] business outside the U.S. The good news is, less than -- about 20% of our CNS revenues are outside the U.S. A lot of the strength in the dollar has already happened, so we certainly factored that into our outlook for EBITDA. So we feel very confident about the EBITDA outlook that we have provided given current exchange rates. Obviously, if the dollar strengthens some more, that could impact us on a margin. But at the EBITDA level, we are more or better hedged, I would say, or have less exposure than the revenue side. As we've explained in the past, our biggest exposure from an EBITDA perspective is the Brazilian real and the euro, not as much the sterling. We are profitable in U.K, but we also -- it's our regional headquarters. So we have a fair amount of sterling expense in the U.K. And at this point, I think, we factored in -- we're assuming currency rates that are in effect right now for our outlook. So we feel quite confident about EBITDA outlook."

Where would that be reflected in the potential for synergies? So you've obviously already outlined synergies that you anticipate from tw telecom specifically, and that's within your traditional 10% to 20% of OpEx of the company acquiring. How should we think about the additional savings you're going to get from -- going back to some of these previous acquisitions? And then the second question, what if any refi have you assumed in your interest expense guidance?

I don't see it impacting -- it certainly impacts our run rate interest expense on a go-forward basis. It might not have as much impact within the year. So I think there are opportunities for us, we have about $1.5 billion of callable debt with coupons in the 8%, so that's certainly an opportunity for us later in the year. They're not callable currently, so -- but I think these are more ""second half of the year type"" opportunities depending on where interest rates are at that time."

So it's easier for our employees to do their jobs and satisfy our customers better. We're trying to make sure that we continue to evolve our network. If you look at our Ethernet product, we have different platforms around the globe in which we deliver Ethernet services. We are moving to a single platform, and we'll be able to deliver a uniform product across the globe wherever the customers are located. And also, a uniform system for employees to use and deliver that product. And so that's what we're talking about, is really creating that one set of products, that one unified network and one set of operational support systems."

We've gone through and changed our channel structures somewhat, moving some things inside sales, some things to the GAM, the global account management team. And so we've aligned that structure and we've gone through and made it clear to every single sales employee what accounts they have. We have a lot of change going on. All of that is a lot.

So there's a lot of activity in the integration of our sales team and making sure that we're in a position to sell our global capabilities in North America and in EMEA and in Latin America. With respect to systems, as you might imagine, Frank, we have a fairly robust and complicated road map for our various systems. Some things -- our ERP, we are standardizing. ERP should be finished by the end of the year, where we are globally operating on a single platform moving that towards the Level 3 systems that we've used. On the customer relationship management, we have a single platform we're moving to. That should be in a relatively short time frame so that our sales team can use a common platform and that we can interface with that through the rest of our systems. Now if you look at our platforms, I mentioned the Ethernet platform. But we are very actively and aggressively looking at our Ethernet platform, our IP VPN platform, our Internet services platforms and making sure that we synchronize those and build the product sets and the network to deliver those fairly quickly.

If you think back, they didn't have a long-haul network really to sell. And so when long-haul deals, nationwide deals were in the mix, they tended not to win those. When there were global deals in the mix, they tended not to win at all, and probably didn't even bid on many of those. So we'll see them -- that side of our business move up market a little bit from customers. If you look from the Level 3 side, the customer base probably stays the same. But our product capabilities improved. If you look at the 30,000 buildings that tw telecom had, we -- and then very little overlap in those buildings with the Level 3. We now have a bigger footprint to sell our products and services to those customers. We know that when we sell on-net, it's better margin for us, it's better experience to the customer. It's easier for us to deliver services and maintain those services in a more reliable fashion than we have -- then when we have to use off-net providers. And I touched on some of the product benefits already with respect to Constellation and the capabilities that brings to us, our CDN and the capabilities that brings to our other side of the tw telecom business."

And our leadership team is focused on making sure that we give the sales team what they need to be successful. We've seen, through my comment earlier on the churn, we've seen that that's working so far because that's the first indicator if a salesperson loses confidence in their ability to sell at Level 3, then they will leave us. And if we look at our top performers, churn is down. If we look at the average sales force churn is about the same as it was prior to the acquisition. And so we have a lot of change going on, but we're very confident about it and working very hard and very closely with the team to make sure that we are focused on the things that will drive our growth and drive our success in that integration. With respect to net neutrality and CDN, we'll -- let's wait and see. I don't want to speculate too much on where things might go. But in general, we're pleased that the regulators are recognizing that interconnection is as big a part of net neutrality than anything else, and we think that they're moving in the right direction. We've heard talk about dispute mechanisms, if you have a dispute with a local monopoly provider where you can have a process for resolving some of these issues. So we'll see where they turn out.

But it is a question we would have to think about in the context next year of how -- what are the best ways to optimize free cash flow per share whether it's debt paydowns or share buybacks or any other mechanism, so we would study that. So that'll be next year's question to study. This year, we're just focused on getting -- integrating tw telecom, hitting on the synergies, hitting our free cash flow targets. And as we indicated, our net debt-to-EBITDA target is at the low end of 3 to 5x. We think that a lot of that will come from adjusted EBITDA growth. We do see strong EBITDA growth this year and also next year, so I think that the combination of that should get us there even without any debt paydowns. But it is an option for us, and we have to look at that compared to other options that we have. And as I said, this is for next year's considerations."

But I think stepping back away from all of this, Jeff says that and I will say that, this also, which is we expect to see our growth come from the enterprise segment over time. The wholesale business, in general, we see as kind of declining slightly every year. Now, in any particular good year. It's tough to predict what happens for all the reasons that you've mentioned that we've talked about, and I would say that this year is not different from any other year with that -- from that perspective.

I won't go into a lot of the specific changes that Andrew is making, but he is making changes in the sales organization for enterprise. He's making changes in the strategy organization and the product organizations and continuing to look at how we serve our customers over there and improving our operations and all of the different things. If you look at Andrew's background just for a minute. A few years ago he ran our wholesale business. Sunit talked about the North America wholesale performance this year. If you look at the challenge in EMEA, wholesale's been a big challenge for us in the last year. And so Andrew's ability and proven track record of working with wholesale customers and understanding the wholesale business and delivering wholesale results is something that I have high confidence in. If you look at where we're making progress in EMEA, but we wanted to be better, is on our enterprise. We've made good progress in selling to enterprise customers last year, but we do -- but we think we can do better. And if you look at Andrew's background and history over the last couple of years in running North America, we've made tremendous progress in our ability to sell to enterprise customers. And so looking at Andrew and his background and the track record that he brings, I'm very confident in our ability to do some of the things that we've talked about. When it comes to the U.K. government, I have less confidence, and Sunit reflected that in our outlook. And I think that has as much to do with the buying pattern of the U.K. government. We thought a couple of years ago that they were going to change the way they bought and buy pieces from different carriers. It turns out that they tend to buy full-breadth solutions, including a whole bunch of things that we don't do. They want to have full solutions from some of their providers. And so I think there's less opportunity for Andrew to make a huge difference in the U.K. government. But if you look at what we've done in North America, and again, Andrew is responsible -- was a key driver in what we've done with the U.S. government, we've been very successful at getting into the business, starting small and growing and growing and growing our importance to the customer. And so I think that we will continue to do that. If you look at our network and our capabilities in Europe, we have a good network. We have good capabilities. We're continuing to introduce products and standardizing those products. And so I think that we have good opportunities in Europe. And again, one of the 3 key priorities for our company this year is to make sure that we live up to our potential. 
I want to -- before we end the call, I'd like to leave you all with a few thoughts. We are highly focused on the successful integration of tw telecom. We're focused on improving our performance in EMEA, and believe that we have the right leader in place and the right team in place to drive the results. We've reached the transformational point in our company's history in terms of free cash flow generation. And while 2015 is somewhat of a transitional year, we expect to significantly improve free cash flow and we remain focused on driving profitable growth and free cash flow per share. We look forward to a successful 2015 and sharing our results with you over the coming quarters. And as always, we really appreciate your questions and your interest in Level 3.

As you can see on Slide 3, 2014 was a solid year for Level 3. I'm pleased with our execution throughout the year and the strong finish from both teams, the stand-alone Level 3 and tw telecom. 
At the beginning of 2014, we highlighted our focus on profitable revenue growth, improving adjusted EBITDA and generating free cash flow. We made significant progress with respect to those financial metrics. 
I'm also very pleased with the completion of the tw telecom acquisition late last fall. Since the close of the acquisition at the end of October, we've made steady progress against our integration plans. The acquisition is an important step in solidifying our place in the industry as we tied together one of the world's most sophisticated and extensive international networks with one of our nation's premier domestic networks. We are very focused on properly integrating the organization, products, networks and support systems, and believe these efforts will position us well for 2016 and beyond. 
Integrating quickly and according to our plans is our highest operational priority for the year and we will not lose focus on those efforts. 
Per our usual process, Sunit will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, then I will provide additional detail on the integration process and what we're targeting for 2015. After that, we will open the call up for your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

We performed well compared to our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Our focus right now is integrating tw telecom. In addition, we are investing for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Before I dive into the details, I'd like to start on Slide 4 and highlight Level 3's performance on a stand-alone basis for the year. Our Core Network Services revenue for the full year 2014 grew 6.1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis compared to 2.9% growth for the full year 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA grew 19% for the full year 2014 compared to our outlook of 14% to 18% growth. We generated free cash flow of $325 million for the full year 2014 compared to our full year outlook of $250 million to $300 million. Including all acquisition-related expenses, our free cash flow was $261 million for the full year. Additionally, we continued to lower our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is now at 4.4x on a pro forma basis to include tw telecom and excluding acquisition-related expenses. 
Turning to Slide 5. On a constant currency basis, CNS revenue grew 5.1% to $1.497 billion in the fourth quarter. On an as-reported basis, CNS revenue grew 3.7% due to the strength in the dollar. On a regional basis, North America continued to show good growth as CNS revenue grew 6.3% and enterprise CNS revenue grew 11%. In EMEA, for the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 0.5% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.2% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis or 6.7% on a reported basis. 
In 2015, as we remain focused on profitability and as contracts come to an end with the U.K. government, we expect steeper declines in U.K. government revenue. As of the fourth quarter 2014, revenue for the U.K. government represented approximately 13% of EMEA CNS revenue. For reference, you can find fourth quarter and full year revenue for the U.K. government footnoted in the revenue table on Page 2 of our press release. We plan to disclose U.K. government revenue for every quarter in 2015. 
In Latin America, for the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 4.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.1% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise revenue grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise growth in the region was a bit weaker this quarter compared to earlier in the year because of a few large disconnects in datacenter services during the quarter. For the fourth quarter, Wholesale CNS revenue grew 7.6% on a constant currency basis or 2.2% on an as-reported basis. 
Wholesale voice services and other or WVS revenue declined to $137 million in the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year 2014, WVS revenue declined 19% to $582 million.
Turning to Slide 6. For the fourth quarter 2014, CNS revenue churn was approximately 1.4%. 
Moving ahead to Slide 8. Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA was $470 million. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $448 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a $10 million Latin America tax benefit. For the full year 2014, adjusted EBITDA grew 19% to $1.869 billion from $1.565 billion in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 28.8% in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2013. Over the course of the full year 2014, we made great progress in expanding adjusted EBITDA margins from 24.8% in 2013 to 28.8% for the full year 2014. The improvement in full year margin was driven by growth in both high-margin CNS revenue and adjusted EBITDA and the benefit of the cost reduction actions taken in the third quarter of 2013. 
On Slide 9. In 2014, capital expenditures were $847 million, representing 13% of total revenue. This was in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 13% of total revenue and included some integration CapEx. As of December 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $580 million. 
Focusing on tw telecom results on a stand-alone basis. As you can see on Slides 10 and 11, tw telecom delivered another quarter of solid growth. Sequential improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by synergies, including executive management headcount reductions, reduced costs from moving tw telecom traffic onto the Level 3 network and generally -- and general salary and benefit savings as all new hires being added to the Level 3 payroll. I'd like to note that going forward, we will no longer be providing separate disclosure for tw telecom results. 
Moving to Slide 12. On a pro forma combined basis, total revenue was $2.052 billion for the fourth quarter 2014 and $8.123 billion for the full year 2014. CNS revenue was $1.915 billion in the fourth quarter 2014, growing 5.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 on a constant currency basis. On an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter, CNS revenue grew 4.8%. Wholesale voice and other was $137 million for the fourth quarter with a very small contribution for tw telecom and represents 7% of total revenue. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue in 2015. On a geographic basis for the fourth quarter, about 79% of our CNS revenues from North America, 11% from EMEA and 10% from Latin America. As a combined company, we have approximately 52,000 customers, of which 94% are in the enterprise segment and the remaining 6 are in the wholesale segment. From a revenue perspective, enterprise is 71% of our CNS revenue and wholesale is 29%. 
Turning to revenue results by product group on Slide 13. On a pro forma combined basis for the fourth quarter and all on an as-reported basis, we saw continued strength in our IP and data services group, which grew 8.9% and represented 46% of CNS revenue. Within that group, CDN revenues grew 7.6% and represent about 2% of CNS revenue. Transport and fiber grew 4.5% and represent 30% of CNS revenue. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 1.7% and represents about 5% of CNS revenue. Dark fiber growth was slower this quarter compared to last quarter because of out-of-period back bills collected in the fourth quarter of 2013. Normalizing for those back bills, dark fiber grew 6.4% and transport and fiber grew 5.2%. Voice services was flat year-over-year, representing 16% of CNS revenue. And colocation and data services, which make up 8% of CNS revenue, declined 5.5% driven by some larger -- large customer disconnects in LatAm and EMEA along with negative currency effects. 
Regarding pricing. As we've said for several quarters, we've seen little change in the pricing environment. We remain disciplined on pricing for Internet services as we manage for profitability and transition those services from wholesale to enterprise customers. 
Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EBITDA, including acquisition-related expenses, was $469 million for the fourth quarter 2014 and $2.271 billion for the full year 2014. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $625 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $2.443 billion for the full year 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding acquisition-related expenses, was 30.5% for the fourth quarter 2014 and 30.1% for the full year 2014. 
Turning to Slide 15. For the fourth quarter 2014, the combined company spent $100 million on transaction-related expenses and $56 million on integration-related expenses. For the full year, the company spent $112 million on transaction-related expenses and $60 million on integration-related expenses. For 2015, we expect to spend roughly $50 million on EBITDA-affecting integration expenses with some remaining costs in 2016. From a CapEx perspective, we expect about $70 million of integration CapEx this year in 2015 as we invest for common network systems and product platforms globally. 
Moving to synergies. During the fourth quarter 2014, we achieved approximately $38 million of our targeted 200 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies, with Network Access cost synergies of $1 million and operating expense synergies of $37 million. Going forward, I'll provide an update on both EBITDA-affecting integration expenses and annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies each quarter. 
Turning to Slide 16. As noted in our earnings release, we completed several capital markets transactions over the past few months and will continue to be opportunistic in managing our balance sheet. Related to those transactions, we expect to incur a $40 million charge for the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of this year. On a combined-company basis, we exited the year with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.4x on a pro forma basis and excluding acquisition-related expenses. This compares to 4.8x at the end of 2013 on a stand-alone basis for Level 3. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter with approximately 341 million shares outstanding. On a fully diluted basis, including the remaining 12 million shares associated with the converts that mature in March, our shares outstanding are approximately 358 million. The company's U.S. net operating loss carryforward or NOL balance was approximately $10.3 billion as of the end of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to now focus on our business outlook, which is outlined in this slide and in this morning's press release. While we are not providing overall CNS revenue guidance, I did want to cover what we expect from a regional perspective on a constant currency basis. Our LatAm CNS revenues grew 8.5% in 2014 compared to full year 2013. We expect comparable performance in 2015. EMEA declined 2.2% in 2014. We expect a smaller percentage decline in 2015, driven by better performance in enterprise and wholesale, offset by a more rapid decline in U.K. government revenue. For reference, U.K. government revenue declined 17% in 2014. In North America, our CNS revenue growth will be a little softer than the 6.8% growth we saw for the pro forma combined company performance in the fourth quarter. This is because we had the benefit of incremental growth in 2014, including turning up the Starbucks contract revenue and some large federal contracts that we don't expect this year. With our focus on profitable revenue growth and synergy savings, we expect strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in 2015. Specifically, from the adjusted EBITDA starting point of $2.271 billion from 2014, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA 12% to 16% for the full year 2015. In addition, we expect to generate free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million for the full year 2015. In 2014, Level 3 spent 13% of revenue and CapEx, and tw telecom spent approximately 25%. On a blended basis, that's approximately 15.5%. In 2015, we expect to spend about 15% of total revenue on CapEx, which includes $40 million in capital expenditure synergies and integration-related CapEx of about $70 million. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect CNS revenue to be up slightly on an as-reported basis relative to the pro forma combined company fourth quarter 2014 figure of $1.915 billion, due to continued underlying growth in CNS revenue offsetting the typical soft sequential comparison from fourth to first quarter revenue. We expect first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA to be up slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $625 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter will be slightly negative due to the payment of annual bonuses in cash for the combined company and higher net cash interest expense of $169 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year and in previous years for Level 3 stand-alone, we only paid 40% of annual bonuses in cash and the remainder in shares of common stock. 
In summary, 2014 was a good year for the company. In 2015, in addition to free cash flow growth, we're focused on integration, synergies and driving profitable revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

To achieve our adjusted EBITDA and free cash",944,"Thank you, Sunit. As I noted earlier, 2014 was a good year for Level 3. As we look to 2015, we're confident in our ability to meet the revenues, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook that Sunit described. To achieve our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlook and continue driving profitable revenue growth, I'd like to emphasize 3 key priorities: First and foremost is the successful integration of Level 3 and tw telecom. Second is enabling EMEA to live up to its full potential and support the growth we believe we can achieve in that region. Third is to position Level 3 for growth well into the future. 
While we have been and will continue to be an acquisitive company, right now, our #1 priority is integrating tw telecom. There are many definitions we could apply to when integration is complete but by my standard, it's a multiyear process and will not be completed in 2015. In broad terms, my definition of completely integrated includes a single set of products for our customers around the globe, a unified sales team capable of selling those products effectively in our target market and our target customer verticals, a network optimized to drive high-margin products to high-margin locations, an integrated operational support platform that enables our employees to deliver the best customer experience in the industry and a global workforce acting seamlessly across international borders and diverse languages to meet the global needs of all of our customers. We've begun initiatives across each of these areas. 
As an example, this week, we completed the go-forward sale structure for the North America sales team, combining the best general managers from both companies and aligning these GMs and their teams around the opportunities our global capabilities create. Effective this month, all of our salespeople across the combined company have their go-forward assigned customer accounts. In addition, as announced last year, we've formalized our global account management structure. This organization, reporting to Andrew Crouch, is charged with providing a seamless customer experience to our largest multinational customers who buy services across the globe. From a product, network and systems planning perspective, the key to our approach is the word one: One product set, one network, one set of support systems. With several past acquisitions, we made the decision to keep multiple instances of certain systems, products and even in some cases, duplicate networks. While this approach has several benefits, it created ongoing complexity in the sales, service delivery and service assurance environments. Given the limited number of acquisitions by tw telecom, their systems environment was much more straightforward compared to Level 3's, especially for the quote-to-service delivery process. We will be scaling those capabilities and working to move the company to a single platform over time. 
In terms of the network, we have interconnected the tw telecom and Level 3 networks and are now beginning efforts to fully integrate them as a single unified network. We're also confident in our ability to deliver the synergy savings we've discussed in previous calls. 
Turning to EMEA. You've heard me say we need to do more to live up to our full potential in that region. I believe we now have the right leader in Andrew Crouch to implement the changes needed and provide the leadership to improve our performance. As many of you know, Andrew was a principal driver of our success in North America. Since taking the helm in November in EMEA, Andrew has moved quickly to make leadership changes and is focusing the team on improving sales, delivering profitable growth and returning the region to the success we've had in the past. 
Before I move on to what we're doing and where we're investing to position the company for the future, I wanted to take a moment to discuss performance and expectations in Latin America. We've had a long history of success and have confidence in the highly capable LatAm team led by Hector Alonzo. For several years in a row, we've seen LatAm deliver double-digit revenue growth. In 2014 and specifically the fourth quarter, growth was not as strong, in part due to the economic environment in the region. However, the underlying factors that drive growth in our business have not changed in Latin America. Bandwidth demands continue to grow at an extraordinary rate, the need for this capacity and connectivity is global in nature, not solely within the region, and as a result, our subsea systems give us a unique product set not easily matched by our competitors, and we have an outstanding team focused on the opportunities within the region and within each country we serve. 
Turning to future growth. We believe all of the work we're doing around integration is also critical for positioning the company to capitalize on future growth opportunities. One set of services over a combined network with a standard operating environment globally allows us to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers. Whether interconnecting a customer's branch locations throughout the world over an Ethernet-based IP VPN, or connecting a corporate datacenter to cloud service providers via Level 3's Cloud Connect Solutions or using Level 3's advanced DDoS mitigation services to protect the company from Internet attacks, Level 3 is well-positioned to meet the complex networking needs of our customers. We remain focused on meeting the wireline communication needs of our enterprise customers, and I'm confident that as we execute against our integration plans this year, we'll continue to position the company to take market share and further transform the business on an ongoing basis. With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

So I'll start first with the question on EMEA. I think that prior to last year, our enterprise revenue growth in EMEA, excluding U.K. government, had been close to double-digit type growth. It was a little softer last year and we see that picking up",772,"Sure. So I'll start first with the question on EMEA. I think that prior to last year, our enterprise revenue growth in EMEA, excluding U.K. government, had been close to double-digit type growth. It was a little softer last year and we see that picking up. We also had a fairly steep decline in the wholesale business in EMEA last year. We think that is stabilizing in the sense of we won't see that kind of decline in the wholesale segment. So therefore, we expect better performance in enterprise and wholesale. I think the U.K. government revenue, we were hoping at this point, to win new government contracts in the U.K. government. What has actually happened, I think as you probably know from last year, with some of the cell-phone-tapping events in Europe, what we've seen is that the business there is going to U.K. carriers, meaning principally, BT and Vodafone. So last year was a relatively stable year for us with respect to U.K. government. Meaning, you saw the year-over-year decline, but a lot of that happened in 2013. Over the course of 2014, our U.K. government and EMEA are fairly stable. So what we are now seeing in '15 and '16 is those contracts are going away, and so that's what's hurting us. So we will see the decline in the U.K. government revenue accelerate a little in 2015, which is why we are going to provide separate disclosure of that. But when you put it all together, the fact that it is a small percent of the CNS revenue in EMEA and with better performance on wholesale and in enterprise, we expect EMEA revenues to decline a little on a constant currency basis, but not as much as the 2.2% decline we saw last year. In Latin America, I think that the datacenter business there is lumpier in the sense that we had some big customers there. We had some disconnects, as I said, some in EMEA, but bigger ones in LatAm. So we saw the impact of that in the quarter. We certainly feel our datacenter business and our assets in Latin America, premier assets, and they should be able to grow that back up again. And as we look at LatAm in general, in spite of the macroeconomic issues that we talked about, other than Venezuela, which I'll quickly touch up on, we expect comparable constant currency growth in LatAm. There continues to be a lot of opportunities, the one particularly strong segment within that, as Jeff mentioned, was the sale -- the demand for subsea capacity to Latin America, which has been a bright spot. Venezuela, just to touch up on that, I think that, in general, most companies are using the SICAD 2 rate, which is -- SICAD 1 rate, I'm sorry, which is VEF 12.1 to the dollar. The official rate is about 6. We've been -- we switched to that SICAD 1 rate some time ago. Over the course of this year as we expect some more news out of the Venezuelan government, which would reconcile the SICAD 1 rate, which is at VEF 12 versus the SICAD 2 rate, which is at VEF 50. So sometime later in the year, we'll have to address that as the government moves in that direction. But away from that, I think, generally, we expect similar growth in LatAm that we saw last year. And then I think your question on currency and in EBITDA. Look, I think the bad news is the dollar strengthened a lot if you have business outside the U.S. The good news is, less than -- about 20% of our CNS revenues are outside the U.S. A lot of the strength in the dollar has already happened, so we certainly factored that into our outlook for EBITDA. So we feel very confident about the EBITDA outlook that we have provided given current exchange rates. Obviously, if the dollar strengthens some more, that could impact us on the margin. But at the EBITDA level, we are more or better hedged, I would say, or have less exposure than the revenue side. As we've explained in the past, our biggest exposure from an EBITDA perspective is the Brazilian real and the euro, not as much the sterling. We are profitable in U.K, but we also -- it's our regional headquarters. So we have a fair amount of sterling expense in the U.K. And at this point, I think, we factored in -- we're assuming currency rates that are in effect right now for our outlook. So we feel quite confident about EBITDA outlook."

Where would that be reflected in the potential for synergies? So you've obviously already outlined synergies that you anticipate from tw telecom specifically, and that's within your traditional 10% to 20% of OpEx of the company acquiring. How should we think about the additional savings you're going to get from -- going back to some of these previous acquisitions? And then the second question, what, if any, refi have you assumed in your interest expense guidance? And I guess, to the extent that you haven't any, what might -- what, I guess, could we be -- potentially being considered?"

So I think there are opportunities for us, we have about $1.5 billion of callable debt with coupons in the 8% [ph] so that's certainly an opportunity for us later in the year. They're not callable currently, so -- but I think these are more second half of the year type opportunities depending on where interest rates are at the time."

So it's easier for our employees to do their jobs and satisfy our customers better. We're trying to make sure that we continue to evolve our network. If you look at our Ethernet product, we have different platforms around the globe in which we delivered Ethernet services. We are moving to a single platform, and we'll be able to deliver a uniform product across the globe wherever the customers are located. And also, a uniform system for our employees to use to deliver that product.

We've gone through and changed our channel structures somewhat, moving some things inside sales, some things to the GAM, the global account management team. And so we've aligned that structure and we've gone through and made it clear to every single sales employee what accounts they have. We have a lot of change going on. All of that is a lot. In addition, we're going to synchronize compensation plans and other things throughout the next few quarters. So there's a lot of activity in the integration of our sales team and making sure that we're in a position to sell our global capabilities in North America and in EMEA and in Latin America. With respect to systems, as you might imagine, Frank, we have a fairly robust and complicated road map for our various systems. Some things -- our ERP, we are standardizing. ERP should be finished by the end of the year, where we are globally operating on a single platform, moving that towards the Level 3 systems that we've used. On the customer relationship management, we have a single platform we're moving to. That should be in a relatively short time frame so that our sales team can use a common platform and that we can interface with that through the rest of our systems. And if you look at our platforms, I mentioned the Ethernet platform, but we are very actively and aggressively looking at our Ethernet platform, our IP VPN platform, our Internet services platforms and making sure that we synchronize those and build the product sets and the network to deliver those fairly quickly.

If you think back, they didn't have a long-haul network really to sell. And so when long-haul deals, nationwide deals were in the mix, they tended not to win those. When there were global deals in the mix, they tended not to win at all, and probably didn't even bid on many of those. So we'll see them -- that side of our business move up market a little bit from customers. If you look from the Level 3 side, the customer base probably stays the same. But our product capabilities improve. If you look at the 30,000 buildings that tw telecom had, we -- and then very little overlap in those buildings with the Level 3. We now have a bigger footprint to sell our products and services to those customers. We know that when we sell on-net, it's better margin for us, it's a better experience for the customer. It's easier for us to deliver services and maintain those services in a more reliable fashion than we have -- then when we have to use off-net providers. And I touched on some of the product benefits already with respect to Constellation and the capabilities that brings to us, our CDN and the capabilities that brings to our other side of the tw telecom business."

And our leadership team is focused on making sure that we give the sales team what they need to be successful. We've seen, through my comment earlier on the churn, we've seen that that's working so far because that's the first indicator if a salesperson loses confidence in their ability to sell at Level 3, then they will lead less [ph]. And if we look at our top performer, churn is down. If we look at the average sales force churn is about the same as it was prior to the acquisition. And so we have a lot of change going on, but we're very confident about it and working very hard and very closely with the team to make sure that we are focused on the things that will drive our growth and drive our success in that integration. With respect to net neutrality and CDN, we'll -- let's wait and see. I don't want to speculate too much on where things might go. But in general, we're pleased that the regulators are recognizing that interconnection is as big a part of net neutrality as anything else, and we think that they're moving in the right direction. We've heard talk about dispute mechanisms, if you have a dispute with a local monopoly provider where you can have a process for resolving some of these issues. So we'll see where they turn out.

I think you've seen that as a common thing we've done, so I think that will continue. And then as far as debt paydowns go, we're not currently thinking of debt paydowns. But it is a question we would have to think about in the context next year of how -- what are the best ways to optimize free cash flow per share whether it's debt paydowns or share buybacks or any other mechanism, so we would study that. So that'll be next year's question to study. This year, we're just focused on getting -- integrating tw telecom, hitting on the synergies, hitting our free cash flow targets. And as we indicated, our net debt to EBITDA target is at the low end of 3 to 5x. We think that a lot of that will come from adjusted EBITDA growth. We do see strong EBITDA growth this year and also next year, so I think that the combination of that should get us there even without any debt paydowns. But it is an option for us, and we have to look at that compared to other options that we have. And as I said, this is for next year's considerations."

But I think stepping back away from all of this, Jeff said that, and I'll say that, this also, which is we expect to see our growth come from the enterprise segment over time. The wholesale business, in general, we see as kind of declining slightly every year. Now, in any particular good year, it's tough to predict what happens for all the reasons that you've mentioned that we've talked about, and I would say that this year is not different from any other year with that -- from that perspective.

I won't go into a lot of the specific changes that Andrew is making, but he is making changes in the sales organization for enterprise. He's making changes in the strategy organization and the product organizations and continuing to look at how we serve our customers over there and improving our operations and all of the different things. If you look at Andrew's background just for a minute. A few years ago he ran our wholesale business. Sunit talked about the North America wholesale performance this year. If you look at the challenge in EMEA, wholesale's been a big challenge for us in the last year. And so Andrew's ability and proven track record of working with wholesale customers and understanding the wholesale business and delivering in wholesale results is something that I have high confidence in. If you look at where we're making progress in EMEA, but we want it to be better, is on our enterprise. We've made good progress in selling to enterprise customers last year, but we do -- but we think we can do better. And if you look at Andrew's background and history over the last couple of years in running North America, we've made tremendous progress in our ability to sell to enterprise customers. And so looking at Andrew and his background and the track record that he brings, I'm very confident in our ability to do some of the things that we've talked about. When it comes to the U.K. government, I have less confidence, and Sunit reflected that in our outlook. And I think that has as much to do with the buying pattern of the U.K. government. We thought a couple of years ago that they were going to change the way they bought and buy pieces from different carriers. It turns out that they tend to buy full-breadth solutions, including a whole bunch of things that we don't do. They want to have full solutions from some of their providers. And so I think there's less opportunity for Andrew to make a huge difference in the U.K. government. But if you look at what we've done in North America, and again, Andrew is responsible -- was a key driver in what we've done with the U.S. government, we've been very successful at getting into the business, starting small and growing and growing and growing our importance to the customer. And so I think that we will continue to do that. If you look at our network and our capabilities in Europe, we have a good network. We have good capabilities. We're continuing to introduce products and standardizing those products. And so I think that we have good opportunities in Europe. And again, one of the 3 key priorities for our company this year is to make sure that we live up to our potential. 
I want to -- before we end the call, I'd like to leave you all with a few thoughts. We are highly focused on the successful integration of tw telecom. We're focused on improving our performance in EMEA, and believe that we have the right leader in place and the right team in place to drive the results. We've reached a transformational point in our company's history in terms of free cash flow generation. And while 2015 is somewhat of a transitional year, we expect to significantly improve free cash flow and we remain focused on driving profitable growth and free cash flow per share. We look forward to a successful 2015 and sharing our results with you over the coming quarters. And as always, we really appreciate your questions and your interest in Level 3.

After Sunit reviews our financial results, I will briefly discuss each of these with most of my comments on the integration of tw telecom. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. 
Sunit, I'll turn the call over to you."
30771,289989602,797041,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a good quarter, and we made steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. Given the first quarter run rate performance on adjusted EBITDA, we are raising our",1762,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a good quarter, and we made steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Given the first quarter run rate performance on adjusted EBITDA, we are raising our 2015 outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
I'll start on Slide 3 of our first quarter earnings presentation. Our core network services revenue for the first quarter of 2015 grew 6% year-over-year. Our enterprise core network services revenue grew 8.1% year-over-year. Including integration-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA grew to $635 million. 
We generated free cash flow of $51 million. And since the acquisition closed, we've now achieved $95 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 6% on a constant-currency basis and 3.9% on an as-reported basis. The difference in growth rates is due to the strengthening of the dollar. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represents 88% of CNS revenue, our top 3 foreign currencies are the British pound, the euro and the Brazilian real, representing 5%, 3% and 3% of CNS revenues, respectively. 
On a revenue weighted average basis, those 3 currencies declined 13% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth by approximately 2% this quarter. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 7%, and enterprise CNS revenue grew 8.8%. In EMEA, CNS revenue declined 0.8% on a constant-currency basis and 9.2% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.7% on a constant-currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. 
U.K. government revenue grew 4.5% in the first quarter but declined sequentially. For the full year, we expect U.K. government to decline a little less than the 17% decline we saw last year, which is a slight improvement from our previous outlook. U.K. government revenue should continue to decline sequentially the rest of this year. Overall, we still expect U.K. government to keep declining over the next several years. This revenue is now 1.4% of total CNS revenue. 
EMEA also CNS revenue declined 11% on a constant-currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis, driven primarily by industry consolidation and associated customer disconnects as well as our focus on profitable growth. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect better performance and comparisons in wholesale over the remainder of the year. 
In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 6.2% on a constant-currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.8% on a constant-currency basis and declined 3.3% on an as-reported basis. 
For the first quarter, wholesale CNS revenue grew 7.4% on a constant-currency basis and was flat on an as-reported basis. We expect the Enterprise business to show stronger performance over the balance of the year. 
With respect to Venezuela, we moved to the SICAD 1 rate in the second quarter of last year. Currently, there is a 3-tiered exchange rate mechanism in Venezuela for exchanging bolivars into U.S. dollars. The first is the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar. The second is the SICAD 1 rate that we are using, which is currently at VEF 12 to the dollar, and the third is a new open market foreign exchange system called the exchange rate that was established in February 2015 and was VEF 193 to the U.S. dollar at March 31, 2015. 
At this time, the majority of our transactions with customers and suppliers are at the SICAD 1 rate. We will continue to closely monitor activity in Venezuela with respect to exchange rates, and we expect the future changes regarding exchange mechanisms could result in a negative affect to our Venezuela operations, profit, cash flows and cash balance. 
At the end of the first quarter, the company's cash balance in Venezuela maintained in bolivars was USD 72 million at the SICAD 1 rate, and we had about $20 million in revenue in the period. 
Wholesale voice services and other or WVS revenue declined 16% to $126 million in the first quarter of 2014 (sic) (2015). We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue in 2015. 
Moving to churn. As many of you are aware, Level 3 had a slightly different methodology in calculating churn from tw telecom. As part of our integration activities, we have adopted tw telecom's methodology, which we believe provides a better representation of true churn or disconnects because that definition excluded churn or disconnects that were replaced by an upgraded service by the same customer between the same locations. 
On a combined company basis, CNS revenue churn was 1%. This was a slight improvement from 1.1% also on a combined company basis from both the first quarter of last year and the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Slide 5 provides an overview of the mix between CNS versus WVS revenue and CNS revenue on a geographic and customer basis. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group, which I'd like to note are shown on an as-reported basis. Because currency had a larger effect on our revenue this quarter, we also noted these results on a constant-currency basis. 
The company's growth continues to be driven by our IP and data services, which grew 9%. Within that group, CDN revenue grew 2.4%. We expect CDN performance to improve later in the year as we deploy more capacity. 
Transport and fiber grew 5.4%. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 3.2%. Voice services grew 0.6%, and colocation and data center services grew 3.8%. 
Regarding pricing, as we've said for several quarters, we've seen little change in the pricing environment. We remain disciplined across our product portfolio and service regions in driving profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network access margin expanded to 64.8% compared to 64% in the first quarter 2014. The improvement in network access margin was driven by integration-related network synergies with continued high-margin CNS revenue growth and low-margin WVS revenue declines. 
Network-related expenses, excluding noncash compensation, were $351 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $347 million in the first quarter of 2014. SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expenses and integration-related expenses, for the first quarter was $339 million. This compares to $342 million for the first quarter of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $635 million for the first quarter of 2015. Excluding integration-related expenses of $10 million, adjusted EBITDA was $640 million. This compares to $625 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $593 million for the first quarter of 2014. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by good progress in capturing operating expense synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including acquisition-related expenses, improved to 30.9% compared to 29.6% for the first quarter of 2014. 
Moving to synergies. Since the acquisition closed, we achieved approximately $95 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies with $14 million of network access cost synergies and $81 million of operating expense synergies. We've clearly made good progress capturing OpEx synergies thus far. For the remainder of the year, we expect to make more progress capturing network access-related synergies. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $254 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing 12% of total revenue. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $51 million in the quarter. Cash flows saw a benefit this quarter, driven by timing of both capital expenditures and approximately $20 million in net cash interest expense that we had expected to incur in the first quarter but was pushed to the second quarter since we redeemed debt that we had refinanced out to April 1 in the second quarter versus our expectations of the first quarter. As of March 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million pro forma for the redemption of the 9 3/8% senior notes on April 1, 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. As noted in our earnings release, we completed several capital markets transactions over the past few months as we opportunistically managed the balance sheet. Related to those transactions, we expect to incur a $136 million noncash charge for the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter. These 2015 refinancing transactions in total saved us about $64 million in annualized cash interest expense. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.2x on a pro forma basis. This compares to 4.4x at the end of last quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our average interest rate on our debt is now 5.3% compared to 6.8% a year ago for Level 3 standalone. 
Moving on to our outlook for the year on Slide 11. Based on first quarter performance, synergy attainment and continued focus on profitable growth, we are updating our outlook for the full year 2015. 
We now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 17% for the full year 2015 compared to our previous outlook of 12% to 16%. We are also raising our full year 2015 free cash flow outlook to $600 million to $650 million, which compares to our previous outlook of $550 million to $600 million. 
Additionally, based on our recent capital markets activity, we now expect $660 million in GAAP interest expense and $645 million on net cash interest expense compared to our previous guidance of $680 million and $640 million, respectively. All other guidance measures remain unchanged and are listed here on this slide. 
Last quarter, in my remarks on the conference call, we had provided our outlook for 2015 CNS constant currency revenue growth performance on a regional basis compared to what we saw in 2014. That outlook remains intact. 
For North America, we expect CNS revenue growth to be a little softer than the 6.8% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. For Latin America, we expect comparable performance to the 8.5% growth we saw in 2014. For EMEA, we expect a decline that will be smaller than the 2.2% decline we saw in 2014. 
In summary, we had a good start to the year and remain confident in our financial performance for the remainder of the year. We feel good about the progress we are making in achieving the synergies as we integrate tw telecom. We look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Since the acquisition of tw telecom, we've talked about 2015 as a transition year for Level 3. As I look back on the 6 months since the acquisition closed, I'm pleased with how much we've accomplished and the lack of surprises. 
To be clear, no surprises is a good thing. The customer experience tw telecom provided is as good as we expected. Our combined portfolio of products and services address the ever-changing challenges our enterprise customers face and are well received in the market. 
The strength of the combined network provides a solid foundation for those products and services. And given the lack of customer overlap between the companies, there's been very little revenue loss driven by the need for diversity. 
Operationally, we've seen very few surprises as well. Maintaining the sales momentum we experienced pretty close has been a key focus area. While sales were a little light at the end of the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter, overall, we've been pleased with the results, and March was a very good sales month. In spite of all the changes and all of the integration efforts, sales in the first quarter of 2015 improved over the same period last year. 
Service delivery intervals are always critical indicators of our integration efforts. Our North America service delivery team has done a very good job and maintained our installation performance. 
Looking at the acquisition synergies, we are ahead of schedule and are determined to capture synergies while also maintaining the customer experience. From a platform perspective, we have interconnected the networks. We've standardized our go-forward architectures globally and have begun implementing a unified network design. And lastly, the systems integration and development work has begun in earnest, and we are building a company-wide platform for growth well into the future. 
At the heart of our integration plans has been a focus on our people. Building one company culture is important to our success, and as a result, it receives a lot of our attention. Even prior to the close, we determined the go-forward organization structure and the leadership team and communicated those decisions to employees clearly and early. 
Shortly after close, we standardized our benefits for all of our North America employees. In early February, we began integrating the sales organization, solidifying the General Manager environment and assigning the go-forward accounts to all sales people. At that same time, we established our global account management team to provide a deeper focus on major customers doing business across multiple regions. 
At the beginning of this month, we rolled out a single customer relationship management or CRM system across North America and EMEA and have implemented a unified sales compensation structure in North America. This is a lot of change for a sales force. 
While there have certainly been issues along the way and it is way too early to declare success, leading indicators are important. Our sales team's confidence and the combined product and service portfolio remain strong. Voluntary sales force churn is consistent with premerger levels. The quality of the sales funnel continues to improve, and our first quarter sales results improved over the same period last year. 
I've discussed our key priority of positioning Level 3 for future growth. Many of the integration initiatives I've mentioned are really the foundation of the global company we are building. Whether in our product portfolio, our operational capabilities or our platforms, we're building Level 3 as a global solution for our customers networking needs. 
While we're focused on integration, we have not lost sight of the need for continual innovation. As an example, we announced the launch of our expanded DDoS platform this quarter. Our customers have very real and strategic security challenges, and they look to Level 3 to safeguard their networks and protect their capabilities. Level 3's unique position to the industry and our ability to see a comprehensive view of the threat landscape allows us to work with enterprises to effectively protect their networks. 
Turning to EMEA. We continue to make changes in management, improve our sales discipline, enhance our operational performance and focus our investments on profitable growth opportunities. I believe we're on the right path for improved performance, but it's still early in the process. We will share our progress in future calls. 
Sunit provided a commentary on our financial performance in Latin America, but I wanted to add a little bit. I spent time in LatAm last month, and I wanted you to know we have an excellent team there. They continue to be optimistic about our opportunity, and despite the macro pressures in those countries, the dynamics that drive our business in the region, dynamics like bandwidth growth, migration to cloud services and the evolution to new IP-based technologies, all of those dynamics remain intact in the region. 
Across our business, customers tell us they appreciate our intimate knowledge of their communications challenges, our ability to design solutions to meet their needs and the personal touch they see from our teams, all of these factors are helping to position Level 3 as the communications provider of choice. 
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

And then second, Jeff, I appreciate your comments on LatAm. Maybe just talk a little bit about what contributed to the little bit slower start than what you might have been expecting for the full year there, and Sunit made a comment that he expected enterprise to get stronger in LatAm throughout the year. Just talk about what the drivers are of that in the region."

They've also had quite a bit of strength in the Wholesale segment, and we think some of that will continue for the rest of the year. So when you put both of those together, we think that you'll see better performance. I think on the North American Enterprise business, as Jeff pointed out, we started off with a good sales quarter, and that helped. But on the revenue performance, as we pointed out last quarter, remember that last year as we said 3 months ago, we were turning up a lot of Starbucks revenue, and we had some fat contracts that we won in 2013 that we were turning up in '14 so we don't have that -- the benefit of those 2 things this year.

Almost all of that was planned on our part, as Sunit mentioned, that we look at the bottom percentage of our sales force and continually manage low-performing people either to make them better or to move them out of the business. But we also look at the skill set we need and the competency we need to fit our go-to-market strategy, and so we're continually evolving making sure that each of our various sales channels have the right people, are of the right size to match the opportunity of the best in front of them. So we'll continue to manage that. We haven't seen yet involuntary or excuse me, voluntary sales attrition outside of what we saw prior to the close of the merger. So we're feeling pretty good about that, but we've made a lot of change to the sales organization, and a lot of that change is just now implementing. And so in my comments, I said it's too early to declare success, but we are paying very close attention. Our sales team knows how critical they are. And rather than focusing on the number of sales people we have in our sales channels, we focus on the productivity of those sales channels, the overall output of those. And we know that the more productive we can make our sales people, the happier they are, the more they stay with us, the better we grow as a business. And so we're focused on making each and every sales person very productive and making sure that we give them the best place to work in the industry."

Outside the U.S. as you mentioned, Colby, it is probably more in our targets than maybe inside the U.S. we given that we've just done the tw telecom acquisition. The real comment I want to leave though in your mind about M&A is we will not do anything from an M&A perspective that causes us to the damage our integration with tw telecom. That is the highest priority for us as a business. I think you're right in saying that the North America team, management team is focused well on that, and so if we were to do something outside of North America, I think that it creates less of a distraction, but we will not do anything from an M&A perspective that harms our ability to integrate tw telecom effectively."

That's true in South America and other places, and we view those assets, the assets that we have as a competitive strategic advantage in our ability to operate.

If you only have IP then everything looks like an IP solution. If you only have CDN, everything looks like a CDN solution. For Level 3, we have all of those things.

With respect to our CapEx strategy, I think you mentioned SDN, Software-Defined Networking and network function virtualization, NFV. Those are things that are very real in the Level 3 network, and we are investing in all of those things. We believe very strongly that our customers want to be able to dynamically insert networking capabilities on the fly.

So on the CapEx side, we looked at how much both companies were spending with various kinds of suppliers whether it was transport gear, voice gear, CDN gear, IP, and it was based upon where we think we could get by just leveraging our bigger purchasing power. So I think, and I think we mentioned this last call that essentially, during the integration planning period and right after closing, we had agreements with most of our suppliers to essentially lock in the CapEx synergies for the year. And I think we sort of declared last quarter that we essentially with the agreements we worked out with various suppliers where we're generally hitting the CapEx synergies right in the first year over the course of this year. On your other question on CNS revenue growth, generally, we expect the CNS revenues in total to be growing sequentially every quarter over the rest of the year, and the reason we made our comments on a regional basis because North America was a little different as we stated the underlying business we feel is strong. It has more to do with what happened last year in terms of the Starbucks and ramping up the Starbucks and fellow contracts that we talked about. But generally even in North America, again we should see decent sequential performance over the course of this year. So I think overall, as we progress through the year, as Jeff said, it's a transition year, and so I think the CNS revenue performance should be steady, but we are working on a lot of elements in terms of network platforms, systems platforms, a lot of change going on which we think will position us pretty well for next year."

First, in terms of integration and what you just talked about with the network, how is the integration I guess of the intelligent network Constellation dynamic capacity going in terms of having that for TWTC customers, and then also I know you talked about a lot about the sales integration, but what about other positions? I mean, we've heard a lot from your competitors saying they're overseeing a lot of people, but that's expected from any merger. So would you say outside of sales again is attrition just kind of your normal? Or are you seeing anything a little different than normal?"

There is always a little bit of attrition as you combine 2 companies together. There are pockets where we have to pay particular attention. It's less to do with the combination of the companies and more to do with some big company opening an office right next door to our location and trying to attract people a way. So I think we're in pretty good shape. There is a natural reduction in force that you have as a result of integrating 2 companies, and to the extent we can, we like to see that happen through attrition as opposed to downsizing. And so we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in sales and outside of sales. With respect to the integration of our intelligent networking capabilities, now I talk about building a platform for the future and a platform that allows us to grow well into the future, and that's part of it. That is part of it because we have network elements that we now have our operational systems, operational support systems directly interconnected in a sophisticated way, not just a simple reporting mechanism but an ability to control those network elements. And as we move toward SDN, as we move toward NFV, as we move toward providing faster services to our customer, more seamless services to our customer, those capabilities are critical. And so it is a fundamental component of our platform strategy going forward, and it's the work that I mentioned in the comments that has now begun in earnest. We're looking at our platforms. We have been looking at them. We've looked at our products. We have been looking at our network infrastructure and how do we really tie all of those things together to provide a better customer experience with more sophisticated products than any of our competitors can do. And so it's absolutely important to us, Jim, and a key part of our strategy going forward.
I believe that was the last question, but before we end the call, I'd like to leave you with 3 key takeaways. First, integration is progressing as expected. And while there's a lot of work to do, we are very focused on continuing our solid execution. Second, we are highly intent on driving improved performance in EMEA and are taking the steps we believe will improve our growth in the region. Third, the overall market for our products and services remains strong, and we continue to make disciplined investments that drive profitable growth and improve free cash flow per share.

30771,289989602,797279,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a good quarter, and we made steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. Given the first quarter run rate performance on adjusted EBITDA, we are raising our",1760,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a good quarter, and we made steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Given the first quarter run rate performance on adjusted EBITDA, we are raising our 2015 outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
I'll start on Slide 3 of our first quarter earnings presentation. Our Core Network Services revenue for the first quarter of 2015 grew 6% year-over-year. Our Enterprise Core Network Services revenue grew 8.1% year-over-year. Including integration-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA grew to $635 million. 
We generated free cash flow of $51 million. And since the acquisition closed, we've now achieved $95 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 6% on a constant-currency basis and 3.9% on an as-reported basis. The difference in growth rates is due to the strengthening of the dollar. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represents 88% of CNS revenue, our top 3 foreign currencies are the British pound, the euro and the Brazilian real, representing 5%, 3% and 3% of CNS revenue, respectively. 
On a revenue-weighted average basis, those 3 currencies declined 13% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth by approximately 2% this quarter. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 7%, and Enterprise CNS revenue grew 8.8%. In EMEA, CNS revenue declined 0.8% on a constant-currency basis and 9.2% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.7% on a constant-currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. 
U.K. government revenue grew 4.5% in the first quarter, but declined sequentially. For the full year, we expect U.K. government to decline a little less than the 17% decline we saw last year, which is a slight improvement from our previous outlook. U.K. government revenue should continue to decline sequentially the rest of this year. Overall, we still expect U.K. government to keep declining over the next several years. This revenue is now 1.4% of total CNS revenue. 
EMEA, also, CNS revenue declined 11% on a constant-currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis, driven primarily by industry consolidation and associated customer disconnects as well as our focus on profitable growth. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect better performance and comparisons in wholesale over the remainder of the year. 
In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 6.2% on a constant-currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.8% on a constant-currency basis and declined 3.3% on an as-reported basis. 
For the first quarter, wholesale CNS revenue grew 7.4% on a constant-currency basis and was flat on an as-reported basis. We expect the Enterprise business to show stronger performance over the balance of the year. 
With respect to Venezuela, we moved to the SICAD 1 rate in the second quarter of last year. Currently, there is a 3-tiered exchange rate mechanism in Venezuela for exchanging bolivars into U.S. dollars. The first is the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar. The second is the SICAD 1 rate that we are using, which is currently at VEF 12 to the dollar, and the third is a new open market foreign exchange system called the Simadi exchange rate that was established in February 2015 and was VEF 193 to the U.S. dollar at March 31, 2015. 
At this time, the majority of our transactions with customers and suppliers are at the SICAD 1 rate. We will continue to closely monitor activity in Venezuela with respect to exchange rates, and we expect the future changes regarding exchange mechanisms could result in a negative effect to our Venezuela operations, profit, cash flows and cash balance. 
At the end of the first quarter, the company's cash balance in Venezuela maintained in bolivars was USD 72 million at the SICAD 1 rate, and we had about $20 million in revenue in the period. 
Wholesale Voice Services and other, or WVS, revenue declined 16% to $126 million in the first quarter of 2014 (sic) [  2015 ]. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue in 2015. 
Moving to churn. As many of you are aware, Level 3 had a slightly different methodology in calculating churn from tw telecom. As part of our integration activities, we have adopted tw telecom's methodology, which we believe provides a better representation of true churn or disconnects because that definition excluded churn or disconnects that were replaced by upgraded service by the same customer between the same locations. 
On a combined-company basis, CNS revenue churn was 1%. This was a slight improvement from 1.1% also on a combined-company basis from both the first quarter of last year and the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Slide 5 provides an overview of the mix between CNS versus WVS revenue and CNS revenue on a geographic and customer basis. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group, which I'd like to note are shown on an as-reported basis. Because currency had a larger effect on our revenue this quarter, we also noted these results on a constant-currency basis. 
The company's growth continues to be driven by our IP and data services, which grew 9%. Within that group, CDN revenue grew 2.4%. We expect CDN performance to improve later in the year as we deploy more capacity. 
Transport and fiber grew 5.4%. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 3.2%. Voice services grew 0.6%, and colocation and data center services grew 3.8%. 
Regarding pricing, as we've said for several quarters, we've seen little change in the pricing environment. We remain disciplined across our product portfolio and service regions in driving profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network access margin expanded to 64.8%, compared to 64% in the first quarter 2014. The improvement in network access margin was driven by integration-related network synergies with continued high-margin CNS revenue growth and low-margin WVS revenue declines. 
Network-related expenses, excluding noncash compensation, were $351 million for the first quarter of 2015, compared to $347 million in the first quarter of 2014. SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expenses and integration-related expenses, for the first quarter was $339 million. This compares to $342 million for the first quarter of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $635 million for the first quarter of 2015. Excluding integration-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA was $640 million. This compares to $625 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $593 million for the first quarter of 2014. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by good progress in capturing operating expense synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including acquisition-related expenses, improved to 30.9%, compared to 29.6% for the first quarter of 2014. 
Moving to synergies. Since the acquisition closed, we achieved approximately $95 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies with $14 million of network access cost synergies and $81 million of operating expense synergies. We've clearly made good progress capturing OpEx synergies thus far. For the remainder of the year, we expect to make more progress capturing network access-related synergies. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $254 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing 12% of total revenue. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $51 million in the quarter. Cash flow saw a benefit this quarter, driven by timing of both capital expenditures and approximately $20 million in net cash interest expense that we had expected to incur in the first quarter but was pushed to the second quarter since we redeemed debt that we had refinanced out to April 1 in the second quarter versus our expectation of the first quarter. As of March 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million pro forma for the redemption of the 9 3/8% senior notes on April 1, 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. As noted in our earnings release, we completed several capital markets transactions over the past few months as we opportunistically managed the balance sheet. Related to those transactions, we expect to incur a $136 million noncash charge for the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter. These 2015 refinancing transactions, in total, saved us about $64 million in annualized cash interest expense. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.2x on a pro forma basis. This compares to 4.4x at the end of last quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our average interest rate on our debt is now 5.3%, compared to 6.8% a year ago for Level 3 standalone. 
Moving on to our outlook for the year on Slide 11. Based on first quarter performance, synergy attainment and continued focus on profitable growth, we are updating our outlook for the full year 2015. 
We now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 17% for the full year 2015, compared to our previous outlook of 12% to 16%. We are also raising our full year 2015 free cash flow outlook to $600 million to $650 million, which compares to our previous outlook of $550 million to $600 million. 
Additionally, based on our recent capital markets activity, we now expect $660 million in GAAP interest expense and $645 million on net cash interest expense, compared to our previous guidance of $680 million and $640 million, respectively. All other guidance measures remain unchanged and are listed here on this slide. 
Last quarter, in my remarks on the conference call, we had provided our outlook for 2015 CNS constant-currency revenue growth performance on a regional basis compared to what we saw in 2014. That outlook remains intact. 
For North America, we expect CNS revenue growth to be a little softer than the 6.8% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. For Latin America, we expect comparable performance to the 8.5% growth we saw in 2014. For EMEA, we expect a decline that will be smaller than the 2.2% decline we saw in 2014. 
In summary, we had a good start to the year and remain confident in our financial performance for the remainder of the year. We feel good about the progress we are making in achieving the synergies as we integrate tw telecom. We look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Since the acquisition of tw telecom, we've talked about 2015 as a transition year for Level 3. As I look back on the 6 months since the acquisition closed, I'm pleased with how much we've accomplished and the lack of surprises. 
To be clear, no surprises is a good thing. The customer experience tw telecom provided is as good as we expected. Our combined portfolio of products and services address the ever-changing challenges our enterprise customers face and are well received in the market. 
The strength of the combined network provides a solid foundation for those products and services. And given the lack of customer overlap between the companies, there's been very little revenue loss driven by the need for diversity. 
Operationally, we've seen very few surprises as well. Maintaining the sales momentum we experienced pre-close has been a key focus area. While sales were a little light at the end of the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter, overall, we've been pleased with the results, and March was a very good sales month. In spite of all the changes and all of the integration efforts, sales in the first quarter of 2015 improved over the same period last year. 
Service delivery intervals are always critical indicators of our integration efforts. Our North America service delivery team has done a very good job and maintained our installation performance. 
Looking at the acquisition synergies, we are ahead of schedule and are determined to capture synergies while also maintaining the customer experience. From a platform perspective, we have interconnected the networks, we've standardized our go-forward architectures globally and have begun implementing a unified network design. And lastly, the systems integration and development work has begun in earnest, and we are building a company-wide platform for growth well into the future. 
At the heart of our integration plans has been a focus on our people. Building one company culture is important to our success and, as a result, it receives a lot of our attention. Even prior to the close, we determined the go-forward organization structure and the leadership team and communicated those decisions to employees clearly and early. 
Shortly after close, we standardized our benefits for all of our North America employees. In early February, we began integrating the sales organization, solidifying the General Manager environment and assigning the go-forward accounts to all sales people. At that same time, we established our global account management team to provide a deeper focus on major customers doing business across multiple region. 
At the beginning of this month, we rolled out a single customer relationship management, or CRM, system across North America and EMEA, and have implemented a unified sales compensation structure in North America. This is a lot of change for a sales force. 
While there have certainly been issues along the way, and it is way too early to declare success, leading indicators are important. Our sales team's confidence in the combined product and service portfolio remain strong. Voluntary sales force churn is consistent with premerger levels. The quality of the sales funnel continues to improve, and our first quarter sales results improved over the same period last year. 
I've discussed our key priority of positioning Level 3 for future growth. Many of the integration initiatives I've mentioned are really the foundation of the global company we are building. Whether in our product portfolio, our operational capabilities or our platforms, we're building Level 3 as a global solution for our customers' networking needs. 
While we're focused on integration, we have not lost sight of the need for continual innovation. As an example, we announced the launch of our expanded DDoS platform this quarter. Our customers have very real and strategic security challenges, and they look to Level 3 to safeguard their networks and protect their capabilities. Level 3's unique position in the industry and our ability to see a comprehensive view of the threat landscape allows us to work with enterprises to effectively protect their networks. 
Turning to EMEA. We continue to make changes in management, improve our sales discipline, enhance our operational performance and focus our investments on profitable growth opportunities. I believe we're on the right path for improved performance, but it's still early in the process. We will share our progress in future calls. 
Sunit provided a commentary on our financial performance in Latin America, but I wanted to add a little bit. I spent time in LatAm last month, and I wanted you to know we have an excellent team there. They continue to be optimistic about our opportunity, and despite the macro pressures in those countries, the dynamics that drive our business in the region, dynamics like bandwidth growth, migration to cloud services and the evolution to new IP-based technologies, all of those dynamics remain intact in the region. 
Across our business, customers tell us they appreciate our intimate knowledge of their communications challenges, our ability to design solutions to meet their needs and the personal touch they see from our teams, all of these factors are helping to position Level 3 as the communications provider of choice. 
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

It seems as though on a constant-currency basis, sir -- well, it's North America, but you started the year at a faster growth rate than what your full year guidance would imply. And then second, Jeff, I appreciate your comments on LatAm. Maybe just talk a little bit about what contributed to the little bit slower start than what you might have been expecting for the full year there. And Sunit made a comment that he expected enterprise to get stronger in LatAm throughout the year, just talk about what the drivers are of that -- in the region."

They've also had quite a bit of strength in the wholesale segment, and we think some of that will continue for the rest of the year. So when you put both of those together, we think that you'll see better performance here. I think on the North American Enterprise business, as Jeff pointed out, we started off with a good sales quarter, and that helped. But on the revenue performance, as we pointed out last quarter, remember that last year, as we said 3 months ago, we were turning up a lot of Starbucks revenue and we had some Fed contracts that we won in 2013 that we were turning up in '14, so we don't have that -- the benefit of those 2 things this year.

But we also look at the skill set we need and the competency we need to fit our go-to-market strategy. And so we're continually evolving, making sure that each of our various sales channels have the right people, are of the right size to match the opportunity that's in front of them. So we'll continue to manage that. We haven't seen, yet, involuntary -- or, excuse me, voluntary sales attrition outside of what we saw prior to the close of the merger. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But we've made a lot of change to the sales organization, and a lot of that change is just now implementing. And so, in my comments, I said it's too early to declare success, but we are paying very close attention. Our sales team knows how critical they are. And rather than focusing on the number of sales people we have in our sales channels, we focus on the productivity of those sales channels, the overall output of those. And we know that the more productive we can make our sales people, the happier they are, the more they stay with us, the better we grow as a business. And so we're focused on making each and every sales person very productive and making sure that we give them the best place to work in the industry."

Outside the U.S., as you mentioned, Colby, there's probably more in our targets than maybe inside the U.S., given that we've just done the tw telecom acquisition. The real comment I want to leave, though, in your mind about M&A is we will not do anything from an M&A perspective that causes us to damage our integration with tw telecom. That is the highest priority for us as a business. I think you're right in saying that the North America team, management team is focused well on that, and so if we were to do something outside of North America, I think that it creates less of a distraction, but we will not do anything, from an M&A perspective, that harms our ability to integrate tw telecom effectively."

And we view those assets, the assets that we have as a competitive strategic advantage in our ability to operate. Having said that, we're always looking at ways to lower our cost for the next bit of capacity, and we'll work with those systems to see how it makes sense for Level 3 to take advantage of what's coming online.

And so we are very accustomed to competing in a competitive industry with -- and competing on the strength of our products and the strength of our customer experience. If you look at our products from a competitive point of view, I think that is one of our big strengths. We have a variety of platforms and technologies to deliver for the networking needs of our customers. If you only have dark fiber, then everything that you sell looks like a dark fiber solution. If you only have IP, then everything looks like an IP solution. If you only have CDN everything looks like a CDN solution. For Level 3, we have all of those things. We have those -- that robust set of products where we can look at a customer's traffic and pick not only the right platform for that customer. But the right platform for some of that customers traffic may not be the right solution for all of it, and so we can bring to those customers the variety of products. And then after we've done that, we can wrap around those capabilities our security services and our DDoS protection. We can wrap around our managed services and professional services. And so we think we're in a very competitive -- a good, competitive position because of the strength of our products, the breadth of our network, the sophistication of our network and ultimately driven by our employees, delivery of a great customer experience for our customers."

And so I can't give you any specific products that we're planning on raising prices on, but we do look at pricing as one of the levers that we have to drive profitable growth, and we have done that in the past, and we'll continue to do that in the future. With respect to our CapEx strategy, I think you mentioned SDN, software-defined networking, and network function virtualization, NFV. Those are things that are very real in the Level 3 network, and we are investing in all of those things. We believe very strongly that our customers want to be able to dynamically insert networking capabilities on the fly. If you look at the tw telecom Constellation family of products and capabilities, we are incorporating that dynamic bandwidth capacity in the go-forward product that we have out for our customers. That is whether you're inserting capacity on demand or you're inserting our DDoS scrubbing network and our DDoS protection network on demand for customers' traffic or your inserting a network firewall, those are the types of SDN, NFV capabilities that we are building into our platform, and it's part of our CapEx program and has been part of our CapEx program."

So on the CapEx side, we looked at how much both companies were spending with various kinds of suppliers, whether it was transport gear, voice gear, CDN gear, IP. And it was based upon what we think we could get by just leveraging our bigger purchasing power. So I think, and I think we mentioned this last call that essentially, during the integration planning period and right after closing, we had agreements with most of our suppliers to essentially lock in the CapEx synergies for the year. And I think we sort of declared with you on that last call that we essentially, with the agreements we worked out with various suppliers, we're generally hitting the CapEx synergies right in the first year over the course of this year. On your other question on CNS revenue growth, generally, we expect the CNS revenues, in total, to be growing sequentially every quarter over the rest of the year. And the reason we made our comments on a regional base is because North America was a little different as we stated. The underlying business we feel is strong. It has more to do with what happened last year in terms of the Starbucks and ramping up the Starbucks and federal contracts that we talked about. But generally, even in North America, we should see decent sequential performance over the course of this year. So I think, overall, as we progress through the year, as Jeff said, it's a transition year, and so I think the CNS revenue performance should be steady, but we are working on a lot of elements in terms of network platforms, systems platforms, a lot of change going on, which we think will position us pretty well for next year."

I mean, we've heard a lot from your competitors saying, ""We're seeing a lot of people coming."" But that's expected from any merger. So would you say, outside of sales, again, is attrition just kind of your normal? Or are you seeing anything a little different than normal?"

There is always a little bit of attrition as you combine 2 companies together. There are pockets where we have to pay particular attention. It's less to do with the combination of the companies and more to do with some big company opening an office right next door to our location and trying to attract people away. So I think we're in pretty good shape. There is a natural reduction in force that you have as a result of integrating 2 companies, and to the extent we can, we like to see that happen through attrition as opposed to downsizing. And so we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in sales and outside of sales. With respect to the integration of our intelligent networking capabilities, now I talk about building a platform for the future and a platform that allows us to grow well into the future, and that's part of it. That is part of it because we have network elements that we now have our operational systems -- operational support systems directly interconnected in a sophisticated way, not just a simple reporting mechanism but an ability to control those network elements. And as we move toward SDN, as we move toward NFV, as we move toward providing faster services to our customer, more seamless services to our customers, those capabilities are critical. And so it is a fundamental component of our platform strategy, going forward. And it's the work that I mentioned in the comments that has now begun in earnest. We're looking at our platforms. We have been looking at them. We've looked at our products. We have been looking at our network infrastructure. And how do we really tie all of those things together to provide a better customer experience with more sophisticated products than any of our competitors can do. And so it's absolutely important to us, Jim, and a key part of our strategy, going forward.
I believe that was the last question, but before we end the call, I'd like to leave you with 3 key takeaways. First, integration is progressing as expected. And while there's a lot of work to do, we are very focused on continuing our solid execution. Second, we are highly intent on driving improved performance in EMEA and are taking the steps we believe will improve our growth in the region. Third, the overall market for our products and services remains strong, and we continue to make disciplined investments that drive profitable growth and improve free cash flow per share.

Over the past few quarters, we've outlined our 3 key priorities: first and foremost is the successful integration of Level 3 and tw telecom; second is enabling EMEA to live up to its full potential and deliver the growth we believe we can achieve in that region; third is positioning Level 3 for growth well into the future. 
After Sunit reviews our financial results, I will briefly discuss each of these with most of my comments on the integration of tw telecom. After that, we'll open it up to your questions. 
Sunit, I'll turn the call over to you."
30771,289989602,797405,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a good quarter, and we made steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. Given the first quarter run rate performance on adjusted EBITDA, we are raising our",1758,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We started 2015 with a good quarter, and we made steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Given the first quarter run rate performance on adjusted EBITDA, we are raising our 2015 outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
I'll start on Slide 3 of our first quarter earnings presentation. Our Core Network Services revenue for the first quarter of 2015 grew 6% year-over-year. Our Enterprise Core Network Services revenue grew 8.1% year-over-year. Including integration-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA grew to $635 million. 
We generated free cash flow of $51 million. And since the acquisition closed, we've now achieved $95 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 6% on a constant-currency basis and 3.9% on an as-reported basis. The difference in growth rates is due to the strengthening of the dollar. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represents 88% of CNS revenue, our top 3 foreign currencies are the British pound, the euro and the Brazilian real, representing 5%, 3% and 3% of CNS revenue, respectively. 
On a revenue-weighted average basis, those 3 currencies declined 13% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth by approximately 2% this quarter. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 7%, and Enterprise CNS revenue grew 8.8%. In EMEA, CNS revenue declined 0.8% on a constant-currency basis and 9.2% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 5.7% on a constant-currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. 
U.K. government revenue grew 4.5% in the first quarter, but declined sequentially. For the full year, we expect U.K. government to decline a little less than the 17% decline we saw last year, which is a slight improvement from our previous outlook. U.K. government revenue should continue to decline sequentially the rest of this year. Overall, we still expect U.K. government to keep declining over the next several years. This revenue is now 1.4% of total CNS revenue. 
EMEA, also, CNS revenue declined 11% on a constant-currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis, driven primarily by industry consolidation and associated customer disconnects as well as our focus on profitable growth. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect better performance and comparisons in wholesale over the remainder of the year. 
In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 6.2% on a constant-currency basis and declined 2.6% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.8% on a constant-currency basis and declined 3.3% on an as-reported basis. 
For the first quarter, wholesale CNS revenue grew 7.4% on a constant-currency basis and was flat on an as-reported basis. We expect the Enterprise business to show stronger performance over the balance of the year. 
With respect to Venezuela, we moved to the SICAD 1 rate in the second quarter of last year. Currently, there is a 3-tiered exchange rate mechanism in Venezuela for exchanging bolivars into U.S. dollars. The first is the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar. The second is the SICAD 1 rate that we are using, which is currently at VEF 12 to the dollar, and the third is a new open market foreign exchange system called the Simadi exchange rate that was established in February 2015 and was VEF 193 to the U.S. dollar at March 31, 2015. 
At this time, the majority of our transactions with customers and suppliers are at the SICAD 1 rate. We will continue to closely monitor activity in Venezuela with respect to exchange rates, and we expect the future changes regarding exchange mechanisms could result in a negative effect to our Venezuela operations, profit, cash flows and cash balance. 
At the end of the first quarter, the company's cash balance in Venezuela maintained in bolivars was USD 72 million at the SICAD 1 rate, and we had about $20 million in revenue in the period. 
Wholesale Voice Services and other, or WVS, revenue declined 16% to $126 million in the first quarter of 2014 (sic) . We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue in 2015. 
Moving to churn. As many of you are aware, Level 3 had a slightly different methodology in calculating churn from tw telecom. As part of our integration activities, we have adopted tw telecom's methodology, which we believe provides a better representation of true churn or disconnects, because that definition excluded churn or disconnects that were replaced by upgraded service by the same customer between the same locations. 
On a combined-company basis, CNS revenue churn was 1%. This was a slight improvement from 1.1% also on a combined-company basis from both the first quarter of last year and the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Slide 5 provides an overview of the mix between CNS versus WVS revenue and CNS revenue on a geographic and customer basis. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group, which I'd like to note are shown on an as-reported basis. Because currency had a larger effect on our revenue this quarter, we also noted these results on a constant-currency basis. 
The company's growth continues to be driven by our IP and data services, which grew 9%. Within that group, CDN revenue grew 2.4%. We expect CDN performance to improve later in the year as we deploy more capacity. 
Transport and fiber grew 5.4%. Within transport and fiber, dark fiber grew 3.2%. Voice services grew 0.6%, and co-location and data center services grew 3.8%. 
Regarding pricing, as we've said for several quarters, we've seen little change in the pricing environment. We remain disciplined across our product portfolio and service regions in driving profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network access margin expanded to 64.8%, compared to 64% in the first quarter 2014. The improvement in network access margin was driven by integration-related network synergies with continued high-margin CNS revenue growth and low-margin WVS revenue declines. 
Network-related expenses, excluding noncash compensation, were $351 million for the first quarter of 2015, compared to $347 million in the first quarter of 2014. SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expenses and integration-related expenses, for the first quarter was $339 million. This compares to $342 million for the first quarter of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $635 million for the first quarter of 2015. Excluding integration-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA was $640 million. This compares to $625 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $593 million for the first quarter of 2014. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by good progress in capturing operating expense synergies. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including acquisition-related expenses, improved to 30.9%, compared to 29.6% for the first quarter of 2014. 
Moving to synergies. Since the acquisition closed, we've achieved approximately $95 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies with $14 million of network access cost synergies and $81 million of operating expense synergies. We've clearly made good progress capturing OpEx synergies thus far. For the remainder of the year, we expect to make more progress capturing network access-related synergies. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $254 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing 12% of total revenue. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately 15% of total revenue. 
The company generated free cash flow of $51 million in the quarter. Cash flow saw a benefit this quarter, driven by timing of both capital expenditures and approximately $20 million in net cash interest expense that we had expected to incur in the first quarter but was pushed to the second quarter since we redeemed debt that we had refinanced out to April 1 in the second quarter versus our expectation of the first quarter. As of March 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million pro forma for the redemption of the 9 3/8% senior notes on April 1, 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. As noted in our earnings release, we completed several capital markets transactions over the past few months as we opportunistically managed the balance sheet. Related to those transactions, we expect to incur a $136 million noncash charge for the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter. These 2015 refinancing transactions, in total, saved us about $64 million in annualized cash interest expense. 
We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.2x on a pro forma basis. This compares to 4.4x at the end of last quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our average interest rate on our debt is now 5.3%, compared to 6.8% a year ago for Level 3 standalone. 
Moving on to our outlook for the year on Slide 11. Based on first quarter performance, synergy attainment and continued focus on profitable growth, we are updating our outlook for the full year 2015. 
We now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 17% for the full year 2015, compared to our previous outlook of 12% to 16%. We are also raising our full year 2015 free cash flow outlook to $600 million to $650 million, which compares to our previous outlook of $550 million to $600 million. 
Additionally, based on our recent capital markets activity, we now expect $660 million in GAAP interest expense and $645 million on net cash interest expense, compared to our previous guidance of $680 million and $640 million, respectively. All other guidance measures remain unchanged and are listed here on this slide. 
Last quarter, in my remarks on the conference call, we had provided our outlook for 2015 CNS constant-currency revenue growth performance on a regional basis compared to what we saw in 2014. That outlook remains intact. 
For North America, we expect CNS revenue growth to be a little softer than the 6.8% growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. For Latin America, we expect comparable performance to the 8.5% growth we saw in 2014. For EMEA, we expect a decline that will be smaller than the 2.2% decline we saw in 2014. 
In summary, we had a good start to the year and remain confident in our financial performance for the remainder of the year. We feel good about the progress we are making in achieving the synergies as we integrate tw telecom. We look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Since the acquisition of tw telecom, we've talked about 2015 as a transition year for Level 3. As I look back on the 6 months since the acquisition closed, I'm pleased with how much we've accomplished and the lack of surprises. 
To be clear, no surprises is a good thing. The customer experience tw telecom provided is as good as we expected. Our combined portfolio of products and services address the ever-changing challenges our enterprise customers face and are well received in the market. 
The strength of the combined network provides a solid foundation for those products and services. And given the lack of customer overlap between the companies, there's been very little revenue loss driven by the need for diversity. 
Operationally, we've seen very few surprises as well. Maintaining the sales momentum we experienced pre-close has been a key focus area. While sales were a little light at the end of the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter, overall, we've been pleased with the results, and March was a very good sales month. In spite of all the changes and all of the integration efforts, sales in the first quarter of 2015 improved over the same period last year. 
Service delivery intervals are always critical indicators of our integration efforts. Our North America service delivery team has done a very good job and maintained our installation performance. 
Looking at the acquisition synergies, we are ahead of schedule and are determined to capture synergies while also maintaining the customer experience. From a platform perspective, we have interconnected the networks, we've standardized our go-forward architectures globally and have begun implementing a unified network design. And lastly, the systems integration and development work has begun in earnest, and we are building a company-wide platform for growth well into the future. 
At the heart of our integration plans has been a focus on our people. Building one company culture is important to our success and, as a result, it receives a lot of our attention. Even prior to the close, we determined the go-forward organization structure and the leadership team and communicated those decisions to employees clearly and early. 
Shortly after close, we standardized our benefits for all of our North America employees. In early February, we began integrating the sales organization, solidifying the General Manager environment and assigning the go-forward accounts to all sales people. At that same time, we established our global account management team to provide a deeper focus on major customers doing business across multiple region. 
At the beginning of this month, we rolled out a single customer relationship management, or CRM, system across North America and EMEA, and have implemented a unified sales compensation structure in North America. This is a lot of change for a sales force. 
While there have certainly been issues along the way, and it is way too early to declare success, leading indicators are important. Our sales team's confidence in the combined product and service portfolio remain strong. Voluntary sales force churn is consistent with premerger levels. The quality of the sales funnel continues to improve, and our first quarter sales results improved over the same period last year. 
I've discussed our key priority of positioning Level 3 for future growth. Many of the integration initiatives I've mentioned are really the foundation of the global company we are building. Whether in our product portfolio, our operational capabilities or our platforms, we're building Level 3 as a global solution for our customers' networking needs. 
While we're focused on integration, we have not lost sight of the need for continual innovation. As an example, we announced the launch of our expanded DDoS platform this quarter. Our customers have very real and strategic security challenges, and they look to Level 3 to safeguard their networks and protect their capabilities. Level 3's unique position in the industry and our ability to see a comprehensive view of the threat landscape allows us to work with enterprises to effectively protect their networks. 
Turning to EMEA. We continue to make changes in management, improve our sales discipline, enhance our operational performance and focus our investments on profitable growth opportunities. I believe we're on the right path for improved performance, but it's still early in the process. We will share our progress in future calls. 
Sunit provided a commentary on our financial performance in Latin America, but I wanted to add a little bit. I spent time in LatAm last month, and I wanted you to know we have an excellent team there. They continue to be optimistic about our opportunity, and despite the macro pressures in those countries, the dynamics that drive our business in the region, dynamics like bandwidth growth, migration to cloud services and the evolution to new IP-based technologies, all of those dynamics remain intact in the region. 
Across our business, customers tell us they appreciate our intimate knowledge of their communications challenges, our ability to design solutions to meet their needs and the personal touch they see from our teams, all of these factors are helping to position Level 3 as the communications provider of choice. 
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

And then second, Jeff, I appreciate your comments on LatAm. Maybe just talk a little bit about what contributed to the little bit slower start than what you might have been expecting for the full year there. And Sunit made a comment that he expected enterprise to get stronger in LatAm throughout the year, just talk about what the drivers are of that -- in the region."

They've also had quite a bit of strength in the wholesale segment, and we think some of that will continue for the rest of the year. So when you put both of those together, we think that you'll see better performance here. I think on the North American Enterprise business, as Jeff pointed out, we started off with a good sales quarter, and that helped. But on the revenue performance, as we pointed out last quarter, remember that last year, as we said 3 months ago, we were turning up a lot of Starbucks revenue and we had some Fed contracts that we won in 2013 that we were turning up in '14, so we don't have that -- the benefit of those 2 things this year.

And so we're continually evolving, making sure that each of our various sales channels have the right people, are of the right size to match the opportunity that's in front of them. So we'll continue to manage that. We haven't seen yet though, involuntary -- or, excuse me, voluntary sales attrition outside of what we saw prior to the close of the merger. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But we've made a lot of change to the sales organization, and a lot of that change is just now implementing. And so, in my comments, I said it's too early to declare success. But we are paying very close attention. Our sales team knows how critical they are. And rather than focusing on the number of sales people we have in our sales channels, we focus on the productivity of those sales channels, the overall output of those. And we know that the more productive we can make our sales people, the happier they are, the more they stay with us, the better we grow as a business. And so we're focused on making each and every sales person very productive and making sure that we give them the best place to work in the industry."

So at this point, we don't see more synergies per se. I think we've just had a strong start. And, obviously, that's in the run rate, which is benefiting overall EBITDA."

That cross-selling and up-selling is part of that. And as you guys know, most of our new sales come from existing customers, and so we will continue to focus on cross-sell and up-sell opportunities but believe that 2015 is a transition year, where we are putting our sales force through an enormous amount of change and our customers through a fair amount of change as well. And so we are really focused on making sure that we make that transition well and that we work closely with our customers to satisfy their needs on a daily basis."

Outside the U.S., as you mentioned, Colby, there's probably more in our targets than maybe inside the U.S., given that we've just done the tw telecom acquisition. The real comment I want to leave, though, in your mind about M&A is we will not do anything from an M&A perspective that causes us to damage our integration with tw telecom. That is the highest priority for us as a business. I think you're right in saying that the North America team, management team is focused well on that, and so if we were to do something outside of North America, I think that it creates less of a distraction. But we will not do anything, from an M&A perspective, that harms our ability to integrate tw telecom effectively."

And so we are very accustomed to competing in a competitive industry with -- and competing on the strength of our products and the strength of our customer experience. If you look at our products from the competitive point of view, I think that is one of our big strengths. We have a variety of platforms and technologies to deliver for the networking needs of our customers. If you only have dark fiber, then everything that you sell looks like a dark fiber solution. If you only have IP, then everything looks like an IP solution. If you only have CDN everything looks like a CDN solution. For Level 3, we have all of those things. We have those -- that robust set of products where we can look at a customer's traffic and pick not only the right platform for that customer, but the right platform for some of that customers traffic may not be the right solution for all of it. And so we can bring to those customers the variety of products. And then after we've done that, we can wrap around those capabilities our security services and our DDoS protection. We can wrap around our managed services and professional services. And so we think we're in a very competitive -- a good, competitive position because of the strength of our products, the breadth of our network, the sophistication of our network and ultimately driven by our employees, delivery of a great customer experience for our customers."

And so I can't give you any specific products that we're planning on raising prices on, but we do look at pricing as one of the levers that we have to drive profitable growth. And we have done that in the past, and we'll continue to do that in the future. With respect to our CapEx strategy, I think you mentioned SDN, software-defined networking, and network function virtualization, NFV. Those are things that are very real in the Level 3 network. And we are investing in all of those things. We believe very strongly that our customers want to be able to dynamically insert networking capabilities on the fly. If you look at the tw telecom Constellation family of products and capabilities, we are incorporating that dynamic bandwidth capacity in the go-forward product that we've had out for our customers. That is whether you're inserting capacity on demand or you're inserting our DDoS scrubbing network and our DDoS protection network on demand for customers' traffic or your inserting a network firewall, those are the types of SDN, NFV capabilities that we are building into our platform, and it's part of our CapEx program and has been part of our CapEx program."

So on the CapEx side, we looked at how much both companies were spending with various kinds of suppliers, whether it was transport gear, voice gear, CDN gear, IP. And it was based upon what we think we could get by just leveraging our bigger purchasing power. So I think -- and I think we mentioned this last call that essentially, during the integration planning period and right after closing, we had agreements with most of our suppliers to essentially lock in the CapEx synergies for the year. And I think we sort of declared with you on that last call that we essentially, with the agreements we worked out with various suppliers, we're generally hitting the CapEx synergies right in the first year over the course of this year. On your other question on CNS revenue growth, generally, we expect the CNS revenues, in total, to be growing sequentially every quarter over the rest of the year. And the reason we made our comments on a regional base is because North America was a little different as we stated. The underlying business we feel is strong. It has more to do with what happened last year in terms of the Starbucks and ramping up the Starbucks and federal contracts that we talked about. But generally, even in North America, we should see decent sequential performance over the course of this year. So I think, overall, as we progress through the year, as Jeff said, it's a transition year. And so I think the CNS revenue performance should be steady, but we are working on a lot of elements in terms of network platforms, systems platforms, a lot of change going on, which we think will position us pretty well for next year."

And then also, I know you talked about a lot about the sales integration, but what about other positions? I mean, we've heard a lot from your competitors saying, ""We're seeing a lot of people coming."" But that's expected from any merger. So would you say, outside of sales, again, is attrition just kind of your normal? Or are you seeing anything a little different than normal?"

There is always a little bit of attrition as you combine 2 companies together. There are pockets where we have to pay particular attention. It's less to do with the combination of the companies and more to do with some big company opening an office right next door to our location and trying to attract people away. So I think we're in pretty good shape. There is a natural reduction in force that you have as a result of integrating 2 companies, and to the extent we can, we like to see that happen through attrition as opposed to downsizing. And so we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in sales and outside of sales. With respect to the integration of our intelligent networking capabilities, now I talk about building a platform for the future and a platform that allows us to grow well into the future, and that's part of it. That is part of it because we have network elements that we now have our operational systems -- operational support systems directly interconnected in a sophisticated way, not just a simple reporting mechanism but an ability to control those network elements. And as we move toward SDN, as we move toward NFV, as we move toward providing faster services to our customer, more seamless services to our customers, those capabilities are critical. And so it is a fundamental component of our platform strategy, going forward. And it's the work that I mentioned in the comments that has now begun in earnest. We're looking at our platforms. We have been looking at them. We've looked at our products. We have been looking at our network infrastructure. And how do we really tie all of those things together to provide a better customer experience with more sophisticated products than any of our competitors can do? And so it's absolutely important to us, Jim, and a key part of our strategy, going forward.
I believe that was the last question, but before we end the call, I'd like to leave you with 3 key takeaways. First, integration is progressing as expected, and while there's a lot of work to do, we are very focused on continuing our solid execution. Second, we are highly intent on driving improved performance in EMEA and are taking the steps we believe will improve our growth in the region. Third, the overall market for our products and services remains strong, and we continue to make disciplined investments that drive profitable growth and improve free cash flow per share.

We also continue investing to position the company for the future initiatives to introduce new product capabilities, extend our network reach and simplify our operating environment, are all intended to drive long term profitable growth. 
With respect to our integration efforts, solid execution and providing a differentiated customer experience remain the top priorities. I'll provide details on our progress after Sunit reviews our financial results. In addition, while Sunit will cover revenue performance by region, I'll share an update on what we're seeing from a business perspective in both Latin America and EMEA. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

We continued to execute on integration during the quarter, and progressed nicely on synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 32.3% in the second quarter of 2015, up from 29.4% on a pro forma basis in the second quarter of 2014. Over the last quarter, we continued to invest in product, network and system capabilities to position the company for revenue growth. 
Moving now to the second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Core Network Services revenue for the second quarter of 2015 grew 5.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 6.7%. Including integration related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $665 million. The company generated free cash flow of $102 million. To our year-to-date refinancing activities, we have reduced annualized interest expense by approximately $84 million and our leverage ratio is now at 4.1x. As of the end of the second quarter, we've achieved $115 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.9% on an as-reported basis. As we saw last quarter, the difference in growth rates is due to the strong dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 88% of CNS revenues as of the end of the second quarter, our top 3 foreign currencies are the British pound at 5%, the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 3%. On a revenue weighted average basis, those 3 currencies declined 16% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth by approximately 2.5% this quarter. On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 6.7%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that we expected CNS revenue for North America to be a little softer than the 6.8% pro forma growth we saw in the fourth quarter 2014 due to the incremental growth last year from Starbucks and some large federal contracts. Our outlook for the year remains consistent with these expectations. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.1% during the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to wholesale. CNS revenue grew 5.8% this quarter. In the quarter, we settled from disputes that led into an unusually strong performance in wholesale. In the third quarter, we expect wholesale CNS revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. For EMEA, we said that we expected a smaller decline compared to the 2.2% decline we saw last year in the region. For the first half of 2015, total CNS revenue for EMEA declined 1.8% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter 2015, CNS revenue declined 2.7% on a constant currency basis and 12% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis and declined 3.5% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.8% on a constant currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis. As we said previously, we expect better performance from EMEA also this year, and we did see slight improvement compared to the prior quarter decline of 11%. 
U.K. government CNS revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 19% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 7% on an as-reported basis. At the beginning of the year, we said we expect comparable performance to the 8.5% CNS revenue growth we saw in 2014. For the year-to-date, CNS revenue in the region grew 5.9% on a constant currency basis, softer than we expected as macroeconomic and political issues persistent. We continue to see headwinds in this area. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis and declined 7.6% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue grew 5.9% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.8% on an as-reported basis. 
Let me briefly touch on Venezuela. As we've been discussing, we are monitoring the situation in Venezuela and the macroenvironment has continued to worsen. At the end of the second quarter, the SICAD 1 rate of VEF 12.8 bolivars to the dollar, the company had a cash balance equivalent of approximately USD 80 million. The June 30, 2015  Simadi exchange rate was VEF 197.3 to the dollar, but we're transacting the majority of our business of the SICAD 1 rate. Our revenue in Venezuela in the second quarter was $24 million.
At the bottom of Slide 4, CNS revenue churn remained low at 1% during the quarter. On Slide 5, Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue or WVS, declined 17% to $120 million in the second quarter 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group, we have provided growth rates on a both on an as-reported basis and a constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services which grew 8.1%, continue to drive the company's growth led by growth in VPN services and managed and converged services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year. We do expect CDN performance to improve for the balance of the year, given the increased investments I referenced last quarter and from the interconnection agreements we signed this past quarter, which should relieve congestion. Transport and fiber grew 3%, and within that group, dark fiber grew 5.7%. Voice services grew 7.1% as a result of the North America wholesale settlement I mentioned earlier. Co-location and data services declined 0.2%. 
Turning to pricing. We continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. As a company, we spent a fair amount of our time analyzing pricing dynamics. We take a market-based approach to pricing, looking at particular geographies, product, verticals and other factors. This has become an institutional capability for us as part of our focus on profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.3% in the second quarter of 2014. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven in part by the high-margin settlement revenue I noted earlier and by integration related network synergies. Continued CNS growth and WVS revenue declines also contributed to the improvement. Network-related expenses, excluding noncash compensation, was $359 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $357 million for the second quarter of 2014.
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation and integration related expenses for the second quarter 2015, was $336 million. This compares to $344 million for the second quarter of 2014. Year-over-year, the reduction in SG&A have been, driven by synergies. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses was $665 million for the second quarter of 2015. Excluding integrated related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA was $670 million. This compares to $597 million for the second quarter of 2014 or $605 million, excluding $8 million in transaction and integration costs during that quarter. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by good progress in capturing operating expense synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, improved to 32.3% compared to 29.4% for the second quarter 2014. We feel good about our ability to continue expanding EBITDA margins as we recognized synergies, further optimize our cost structure and add high-margin CNS revenues. 
Moving to synergies. Since the acquisition closed, we've achieved approximately $115 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies with $25 million on Network Access cost synergies and $90 million of operating expense synergies. The focus going forward is around network synergies, which take a little longer to achieve compared to OpEx synergies. We continue to remain confident about our ability to achieve 70% or $140 million of our synergy targets by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $317 million in the second quarter of 2015 and are 14% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. The company generated free cash flow of $102 million in the quarter. As a result of the Capital Markets transactions completed during the quarter, our cash interest expense in the second quarter was a little higher than usual. Given our cash interest expense guidance of $640 million for 2015, we expect quarterly cash interest expense of about $460 million. In the second quarter, as a result of the refinancings, cash interest expense was $219 million. Year-to-date, our cash interest expense is $365 million. As of June 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $549 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.1x. This compares to 4.2x at the end of last quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x, which we expect to be driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our average interest rate on our debt is now 5.1% compared to 5.3% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6% -- 6.8% for Level 3 standalone in the second quarter of 2014. 
Turning to business outlook on Slide 11. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. We are reiterating our outlook we provided last quarter with 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 17% from a starting point of $2.271 billion pro forma for the tw telecom acquisition and including integration expenses. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $600 million to $550 million for the full year 2015. Given the Capital Markets activity in the quarter, we are lowering our interest expense outlook for the full year 2015 and now expect GAAP interest expense of approximately $650 million and net cash interest expense of approximately $640 million compared to our prior outlook of $660 million and $645 million, respectively. All other outlook measures remain unchanged. 
As we look to the third quarter 2015, we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs generally in the high single digit millions of dollars as a result of the higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. Also, we won't see the benefit of second quarter dispute settlement that we saw in North America also in the quarter. 
In summary, we are pleased with our progress on adjusted EBITDA growth and the continued margin expansion we've been able to achieve. For the second half of the year, we remain focused on integration and continue to recognize additional synergies. We're continuing to invest in the business both to drive profitable revenue growth and optimize cost. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

The successful integration of our company remains our top priority. In the past, many of you may have heard me talk about the notion of 1 that is so integral to our approach, combining and simplifying our product capabilities to create 1 portfolio of products regardless of geography. Standardizing our network technologies and architectures to create 1 comprehensive global network and selecting and integrating our operational support systems to provide 1 operating environment for our employees and customers around the world. Each of these are key initiation activities. 
On our first quarter earnings call, I noted that there have been no major surprises as part of the integration process. I'm pleased to say this remains true for the second quarter as well. Last quarter, I updated you on the various initiatives to integrate 2 sales teams of roughly equivalent size in North America. Account moves an organization realignments, CRM and other systems migrations as well as restructuring of the compensation plans are a few of the changes that impacted our sales team during the first few months of the year. For the past 90 days, we have not introduced any significant changes for the sales organization. While unwanted sales or sufficient has ticked up slightly, we are being very close attention to it. Having said that, attrition is still within our expectation. We remain focused on maintaining the sales momentum, the 2 companies experienced prior to close. 
In the second quarter, CNS sales increased slightly both sequentially and year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As you've heard me say before, we're pleased, but not satisfied. I believe we can do more to make it easier for the sales force to cross sell, upsell, and improve overall productivity. I've been asked questions before about the competitiveness of our new combined offering and whether we can win more business than either of the previous companies could as stand-alone entities. I thought I'd share one example. A recent deal with a company that is an intermediary for the information exchange between health plans and providers. They help to use the complexity of moving businesses and clinical information to healthcare, stakeholders nationwide. As a customer, both level 3 and tw telecom, the company came to us with the need for an updated solution across their network. The current solution included circuits from Level 3, tw telecom as well as other carriers. As a result of Level 3's now broader product portfolio and larger OnNet footprint, we updated their full branch network into a single carrier solution with higher throughput speeds on that co-location and 100% physical diversity. This new solution is helping our customer keep pace with ever-changing regulatory and technology requirements. 
As we continue the integration of our products, networks and systems, we are laying the foundation for initiatives that are key to driving future profitable growth, making it easier for customers to do business with Level 3, while also optimizing our cost structure creates more compelling offers in the market. As examples, we've completed the integration of all core security services to our in-state products and platforms. We're continuing to add capabilities to our managed security portfolio, just after the close of the quarter, we announced that we are strengthening our capabilities in this area with the acquisition of Black Lotus. While not financially material, the acquisition brings important proxy-based DDoS mitigation services along with additional scrubbing centers and talented security professionals to the Level 3 team. We've standardized on a single unit platform and by platform, I mean, the product definitions, the network to deploy those products and the systems to support them. We completed our rollout of the newly ethernet platform in North America and expect to complete the rollout in EMEA, by the end of the year, and Latin America in 2016. As one of the largest FDN deployments in our industry, these unified global capabilities will provide a differentiated experience for our customers in doing business in multiple locations as well as streamline Level 3 operations. We're investing to add CDN capacity around the world to meet growing demand in support of video and other content distributed online. We worked diligently with industry partners to redefine interconnection and ensure access to an open Internet for all of our customers. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes sharing my perspectives on our LatAm and EMEA businesses. 
I spend a lot of time training in each of our regions meeting with management, employees and customers. As I mentioned on our last call, I was in Latin America in March. While Sunit described the continued pressure we see from the economic and political environment in the region we are still growing the business and I believe we are well positioned to achieve stronger growth when a regional economic conditions improve. I returned last week from EMEA. I believe we're making progress in our efforts to return EMEA to growth. As you may have seen from the announcement yesterday, Andrew Crouch is now filled out is management team and we've hired key executives in sales, marketing and strategy, supplementing our already strong leaders in operations, finance, human resources and legal. While we continue to take advantage of our pan-European footprint, the top priorities for the team are to improve sales disciplined, enhance customer targeting and drive more OnNet building and network expansions in 4 territories within EMEA, the U.K., France, Germany and Benelux. We clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe we're taking the right steps to grow our market share and provide for long-term growth in this large market. 
Across the globe, CIOs are asked to help their companies grow, managing increasingly complex and demanding user needs. Protect their company's data and network capabilities in an escalating and hostile environment, while at the same time, reducing their overall cost to operate. Whether using our sophisticated security services to protect their enterprise or coupling Level 3 Ethernet services with their internal SDN capabilities or using IPVPNs to tie together their offices around the world, our customers continue to transition to the flexible, scalable IP and optical services we provide to meet their evolving needs. At this point, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

And if the sales are starting to improve, if we could start to see improvement in the back half of this year. And then my second question is on EBITDA. If you simply annualize the EBITDA that you just recorded in the second quarter, you'd effectively be at 17% year-over-year, which would be at the high end of year guidance.

So our sales bookings were up sequentially and year-over-year.

So the performance is in line with what we -- with respect to North America. Enterprise is in line with what we've talked about. And so we're just seeing that, there's nothing that has changed fundamentally. I think the sales momentum is pretty good given the size of the combination of the 2 companies coming together, bringing them together in North America, and install the tools are holding up as you would expect for the kind of products and services we're selling.

For us, the business continues to be a good profitable business for us, the margins in our wholesale business are comparable to what we've -- for our Enterprise business, we're happy with our profitability. In terms of the trends for the balance of the year, I mean, I think that -- there are 2 ways I'll look at it. One is with respect to our overall enterprise revenue, we do expect better sequential comparisons for the balance of the year. And we expect that the year-over-year enterprise trends will be consistent with what we've seen this quarter overall, specifically with respect to North America I think we'll see on the margin, slight improvement, but consistent with what we reported this quarter. So in answer to your question, yes. I mean the sales bookings should continue to benefit us. The year-over-year comparisons can get a little clouded by onetime things we had last year. As I mentioned, Starbucks and the federal contracts, which is why I mentioned the sequential point. So I think overall, given the size of the acquisition that we did and all of the changes we have going on, we're pretty -- we think performance is holding up as we expected in North America."

Similarly in North America, we'll be on 1 billing platform by the end of the year. So as these progress, you do get efficiencies over time. With respect to your CDN question, yes, the situation that we faced at the beginning of this year was not having enough capacity on our network, which takes a couple of quarters to put in. And the second issue we faced was congestion on and peering length and you saw, we made quite a bit of progress in the second quarter, signing interconnection agreements with a number of carriers. So the combination of both those things, we think will lead to much better performance from existing customers and having said that, as Jeff pointed out earlier, with provider and enterprise based that we have in general, over time, we think we can do a better job of cross-selling in to that. But obviously, that 'll take a bit of time. For the balance of the year, you see a lot of it coming from, just the existing customers."

We continued to execute on integration during the quarter, and progressed nicely on synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 32.3% in the second quarter of 2015, up from 29.4% on a pro forma basis in the",1772,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We continued to execute on integration during the quarter, and progressed nicely on synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 32.3% in the second quarter of 2015, up from 29.4% on a pro forma basis in the second quarter of 2014. Over the last quarter, we continued to invest in product, network and system capabilities to position the company for revenue growth. 
Moving now to the second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Core Network Services revenue for the second quarter of 2015 grew 5.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 6.7%. Including integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $665 million. The company generated free cash flow of $102 million. To our year-to-date refinancing activities, we have reduced annualized interest expense by approximately $84 million and our leverage ratio is now at 4.1x. As of the end of the second quarter, we have achieved $115 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.9% on an as-reported basis. As we saw last quarter, the difference in growth rates is due to the strong dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 88% of CNS revenues as of the end of the second quarter, our top 3 foreign currencies are the British pound at 5%, the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 3%. On a revenue-weighted average basis, those 3 currencies declined 16% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth by approximately 2.5% this quarter. On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 6.7%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that we expected CNS revenue for North America to be a little softer than the 6.8% pro forma growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the incremental growth last year from Starbucks and some large federal contracts. Our outlook for the year remains consistent with these expectations. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.1% during the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to wholesale. CNS revenue grew 5.8% this quarter. In the quarter, we settled some disputes that led to an unusually strong performance in wholesale. In the third quarter, we expect wholesale CNS revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. For EMEA, we said that we expected a smaller decline compared to the 2.2% decline we saw last year in the region. For the first half of 2015, total CNS revenue for EMEA declined 1.8% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter of 2015, CNS revenue declined 2.7% on a constant currency basis and 12% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis and declined 3.5% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.8% on a constant currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis. As we said previously, we expect better performance from EMEA also this year, and we did see slight improvement compared to the prior quarter decline of 11%. 
U.K. government CNS revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 19% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 7% on an as-reported basis. At the beginning of the year, we said we expect comparable performance to the 8.5% CNS revenue growth we saw in 2014. For the year-to-date, CNS revenue in the region grew 5.9% on a constant currency basis, softer than we expected as macroeconomic and political issues persist. We continue to see headwinds in this area. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis and declined 7.6% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue grew 5.9% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.8% on an as-reported basis. 
Let me briefly touch on Venezuela. As we've been discussing, we are monitoring the situation in Venezuela and the macro environment has continued to worsen. At the end of the second quarter, at the SICAD 1 rate of VEF 12.8 to the dollar, the company had a cash balance equivalent of approximately USD 80 million. The June 30, 2015 Simadi exchange rate was VEF 197.3 to the dollar, but we're still transacting the majority of our business to the SICAD 1 rate. Our revenue in Venezuela in the second quarter was $24 million.
At the bottom of Slide 4, CNS revenue churn remained low at 1% during the quarter. On Slide 5, Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue, or WVS, declined 17% to $120 million in the second quarter 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. We have provided growth rates on a -- both on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services, which grew 8.1%, continue to drive the company's growth, led by growth in VPN services and managed and converged services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year. We do expect CDN performance to improve for the balance of the year, given the increased investment I referenced last quarter and from the interconnection agreements we signed this past quarter, which should relieve peering congestion. Transport and fiber grew 3%. And within that group, dark fiber grew 5.7%. Voice services grew 7.1% as a result of the North America wholesale settlement I mentioned earlier. Colocation and data services declined 0.2%. 
Turning to pricing. We continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. As a company, we spend a fair amount of time analyzing pricing dynamics. We take a market-based approach to pricing, looking at particular geographies, products, verticals and other factors. This has become an institutional capability for us as part of our focus on profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.3% in the second quarter of 2014. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven in part by the high-margin settlement revenue I noted earlier and by integration-related network synergies. Continued CNS growth and WVS revenue declines also contributed to the improvement. Network-related expenses, excluding noncash compensation, was $359 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $357 million for the second quarter of 2014.
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation and integration-related expenses for the second quarter of 2015, was $336 million. This compares to $344 million for the second quarter of 2014. Year-over-year, the reduction in SG&A have been driven by synergies. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $665 million for the second quarter of 2015. Excluding integrated-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA was $670 million. This compares to $597 million for the second quarter of 2014 or $605 million, excluding $8 million in transaction and integration costs that quarter. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by good progress in capturing operating expense synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, improved to 32.3% compared to 29.4% for the second quarter of 2014. We feel good about our ability to continue expanding adjusted EBITDA margins as we recognized synergies, further optimize our cost structure and add high-margin CNS revenues. 
Moving to synergies. Since the acquisition closed, we've achieved approximately $115 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies with $25 million on Network Access cost synergies and $90 million of operating expense synergies. The focus going forward is around network synergies, which take a little longer to achieve compared to OpEx synergies. We continue to remain confident about our ability to achieve 70% or $140 million of our synergy targets by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $317 million in the second quarter of 2015 and are 14% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. The company generated free cash flow of $102 million in the quarter. As a result of the capital markets transactions completed during the quarter, our cash interest expense in the second quarter was a little higher than usual. Given our cash interest expense guidance was $640 million for 2015, we expect quarterly cash interest expense of about $160 million. In the second quarter, as a result of the refinancings, cash interest expense was $219 million. Year-to-date, our cash interest expense is $365 million. As of June 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $549 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.1x. This compares to 4.2x at the end of last quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x, which we expect to be driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our average interest rate on our debt is now 5.1% compared to 5.3% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6% -- 6.8% for Level 3 stand-alone in the second quarter of 2014. 
Turning to business outlook on Slide 11. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. We are reiterating our outlook we've provided last quarter with 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 17% from a starting point of $2.271 billion pro forma for the tw telecom acquisition and including integration expenses. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million for the full year 2015. Given the capital markets activity in the quarter, we are lowering our interest expense outlook for the full year 2015 and now expect GAAP interest expense of approximately $650 million and net cash interest expense of approximately $640 million compared to our prior outlook of $660 million and $645 million, respectively. All other outlook measures remain unchanged. 
As we look to the third quarter of 2015, we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs generally in the high single-digit millions of dollars as a result of the higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. Also, we don't -- we won't see the benefit of the second quarter dispute settlement that we saw in North America also in the quarter. 
In summary, we are pleased with our progress on adjusted EBITDA growth and the continued margin expansion we've been able to achieve. For the second half of the year, we remain focused on integration and continue to recognize additional synergies. We're continuing to invest in the business both to drive profitable revenue growth and optimize cost. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

As I said at the beginning of the year, we look at 2015 as a transition year. The successful integration of our company remains our top priority. In the past, many of you may have heard me talk about the notion of one that is so integral",1067,"Thank you, Sunit. As I said at the beginning of the year, we look at 2015 as a transition year. The successful integration of our company remains our top priority. In the past, many of you may have heard me talk about the notion of one that is so integral to our approach, combining and simplifying our product capabilities to create one portfolio of products regardless of geography, standardizing our network technologies and architectures to create one comprehensive global network and selecting and integrating our operational support systems to provide one operating environment for our employees and customers around the world. Each of these are key integration initiatives. 
On our first quarter earnings call, I noted that there have been no major surprises as part of the integration process. I'm pleased to say this remains true for the second quarter as well. Last quarter, I updated you on the various initiatives to integrate 2 sales teams of roughly equivalent size in North America. Account moves and organization realignments, CRM and other systems migrations as well as restructuring of the compensation plans are a few of the changes that impacted our sales team during the first few months of the year. For the past 90 days, we have not introduced any significant changes for the sales organization. While unwanted sales, forced attrition has ticked up slightly, we're paying very close attention to it. Having said that, attrition is still within our expectations. We remain focused on maintaining the sales momentum the 2 companies experienced prior to close. 
In the second quarter, CNS sales increased slightly both sequentially and year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As you've heard me say before, we're pleased, but not satisfied. I believe we can do more to make it easier for the sales force to cross-sell, up-sell, and improve overall productivity. I've been asked questions before about the competitiveness of our new combined offering and whether we can win more business than either of the previous companies could as stand-alone entities. I thought I would share one example: A recent deal with a company that is an intermediary for the information exchange between health plans and providers. They help to ease the complexity of moving business and clinical information to health care stakeholders nationwide. As a customer, both Level 3 and tw telecom, the company came to us with the need for an updated solution across their network. Their current solution included circuits from Level 3, tw telecom as well as other carriers. As a result of Level 3's now broader product portfolio and larger on-net footprint, we updated their full branch network into a single-carrier solution with higher throughput speeds on that colocation and 100% physical diversity. This new solution is helping our customer keep pace with ever-changing regulatory and technology requirements. 
As we continue the integration of our products, networks and systems, we are laying the foundation for initiatives that are key to driving future profitable growth, making it easier for customers to do business with Level 3, while also optimizing our cost structure creates more compelling offers in the market. As examples, we've completed the integration of all core security services to our in-state products and platforms. We're continuing to add capabilities to our managed security portfolio. Just after the close of the quarter, we announced that we are strengthening our capabilities in this area with the acquisition of Black Lotus. While not financially material, the acquisition brings important proxy-based DDoS mitigation services along with additional scrubbing centers and talented security professionals to the Level 3 team. We've standardized on a single Ethernet platform. And by platform, I mean, the product definitions, the network to deploy those products and the systems to support them. We've completed our rollout of the new Ethernet platform in North America and expect to complete the rollout in EMEA by the end of the year and Latin America in 2016. As one of the largest SDN deployments in our industry, these unified global capabilities will provide a differentiated experience for our customers in doing business in multiple locations as well as streamline Level 3 operations. We're investing to add CDN capacity around the world to meet growing demand in support of video and other content distributed online. We've worked diligently with industry partners to redefine interconnection and ensure access to an open Internet for all of our customers. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes sharing my perspectives on our LatAm and EMEA businesses. 
I spend a lot of time traveling in each of our 3 regions, meeting with management, employees and customers. As I mentioned on our last call, I was in Latin America in March. While Sunit described the continued pressure we see from the economic and political environment in the region, we are still growing the business and I believe we are well positioned to achieve stronger growth when the regional economic conditions improve. I returned last week from EMEA. I believe we're making progress in our efforts to return EMEA to growth. As you may have seen from the announcement yesterday, Andrew Crouch has now filled out his management team and we've hired key executives in sales, marketing and strategy, supplementing our already strong leaders in operations, finance, human resources and legal. While we continue to take advantage of our pan-European footprint, the top priorities for the team are to improve sales discipline, enhance customer targeting and drive more on-net buildings and network expansions in 4 territories within EMEA, the U.K., France, Germany and Benelux. We clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe we're taking the right steps to grow our market share and provide for long-term growth in this large market. 
Across the globe, CIOs are asked to help their companies grow, manage increasingly complex and demanding user needs, protect their company's data and network capabilities in an escalating and hostile environment, while at the same time, reducing their overall cost to operate. Whether using our sophisticated security services to protect their enterprise or coupling Level 3 Ethernet services with their internal SDN capabilities or using IP VPNs to tie together their offices around the world, our customers continue to transition to the flexible, scalable IP and optical services we provide to meet their evolving needs. 
At this point, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

So you mentioned in your response, I guess, to Simon's question, that sales were up on a year-over-year basis. I was wondering if you could talk about what the trend was quarter-over-quarter. And I guess that was the one area, at least in our model, where we saw weakness relative to expectation. Curious, if that's simply a result of that sales force integration in the first quarter and that book to bill and how that impacted the second quarter, and if the sales are starting to improve, if we could start to see improvement in the back half of this year. And then my second question is on EBITDA. If you simply annualize the EBITDA that you just recorded in the second quarter, you'd effectively be at 17% year-over-year, which would be at the high end of your guidance. Is that meant to imply that we could be seeing flat EBITDA or even down EBITDA in the back half of the year? Are you simply being conservative with your guidance?"

So our sales bookings were up sequentially and year-over-year. As far as the revenue goes, as we've been saying for 2 quarters now, that we're going to see a little softer performance over the balance of the year in North America because of the Starbucks and the federal contracts, the Starbucks revenue was ramping up this last year and some into the beginning of this year, and then we had some federal contracts that peeled off, that we talked about. So the performance is in line with what we -- in respect to North America. Enterprise is in line with what we've talked about. And so we're just seeing that. There's nothing that has changed fundamentally. I think the sales momentum is pretty good given the size of the combination of the 2 companies coming together, bringing them together in North America, and installing tools are holding up as you would expect for the kind of products and services we're selling. So the revenue performance, again, we've been saying this for 2 quarters and you're just seeing that play out. We'll see that play out for the rest of the year as we've talked about previously."

I think you heard us say for quite a number of years that in general, for a longer period of time, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly down. And now we've been benefited last couple of quarters, at least in North America, with some settlements, particularly this past quarter. Our LatAm business is doing well because they're geared more towards consumer media and some of their wholesale customers. So I don't think anything's changed that for us. For us, the business continues to be a good profitable business for us, the margins in our wholesale business are comparable to what we've -- to our enterprise business, so we're happy with the profitability. In terms of the trends for the balance of the year, I mean, I think that -- there are 2 ways I've looked at it. One is with respect to our overall enterprise revenue, we do expect better sequential comparisons for the balance of the year. And we expect that the year-over-year enterprise trends will be consistent with what we've seen this quarter overall, specifically with respect to North America, I think we'll see on the margin, slight improvement, but consistent with what we reported this quarter. So in answer to your question, yes. I mean, the sales bookings should continue to benefit us. The year-over-year comparisons can get a little clouded by onetime things we had last year. As I mentioned, Starbucks and the federal contracts, which is why I mentioned the sequential point. So I think overall, given the size of the acquisition we did and everything -- all the changes we have going on, we're pretty -- we think performance is holding up as we expected in North America."

So it's absolutely a key part of our strategy, a key part of our efforts to improve within the sales channel."

I think North America, the business actually do a little. With respect to IP and data services, the whole collection in general, revenues were up quite nicely. We did get impacted, as I mentioned, by Starbucks and Fed, as we've been talking about for the last 2 quarters now. So it happened as we expected. Within transport and fiber, as I mentioned, fiber grew strongly within transport. We saw growth in wavelengths with some decline in private line. But again, consistent with what we had outlined."

We have a better footprint. We have a better product portfolio, but we've got to migrate those things together. And so we have focused very hard on making sure our product definitions of the products are uniform, and so that you can sell our Ethernet service regardless of the building, regardless of the geography, meaning Europe or North America, you can sell a standard Ethernet product to your customer. We've also enhanced the capabilities, making sure that the SDN capabilities that we've built into our Ethernet product are available to our customers and that they understand how to utilize that within their infrastructure to take advantage of those capabilities. And so it starts with the product definitions. It also has to include, though, making sure that we have integrated the networks and the way that I talked about -- and again, I'll use the Ethernet example, but the way we've talked about with Ethernet, building the platform, so that across North America now, our customers, if they order new Ethernet services from us, they go across one system, they go across one network and they have one product definition regardless of where you're buying it. We're deploying that, as we speak, in EMEA, and we'll follow up in early parts of 2016, beginning deploying that in Latin America. And so the product definitions, the infrastructure, the support systems, all of those things are critical to drive better performance. We've already done a lot of the things that we needed to do from a sales organization. We've consolidated the customer relationship management systems, so we have one view of the customers. We've standardized our funneling process, and we've standardized our compensation. And so we've already started many of those activities and are starting to see the sales organization settle down into the new structure that we have and the new approach that we have. And then we also have to continue to move some of our lower in sales reps up market, and selling more to our sweet-spot customers. So customer targeting and making sure we're effectively using our sales force time, our other areas that we're really focused on."

So looking at CRM, we chose the Salesforce.com implementation. There will be different components from Level 3, different components from tw telecom as we implement our operational support systems going forward, but all with the philosophy of we want to have a single product portfolio globally that we can deliver to our customers. We want to have the infrastructure, network components in place that are consistent across the globe to deliver that product and service. But they can be controlled in an automated fashion by our high-layer operational support systems to build in SDN capabilities going forward, to build in the flexibility and the ease of control that we've talked about and to simplify our operating environment for our employees and simplify the operating environment for our customers as well.

Similarly in North America, we'll be on one billing platform by the end of the year. So as these progress, you do get efficiencies over time. With respect to your CDN question, yes, the situation that we faced at the beginning of this year was not having enough capacity on our network, which takes a couple of quarters to put in. And the second issue we face was congestion on peering links, and you saw we made quite a bit of progress in the second quarter, signing interconnection agreements with a number of carriers. So the combination of both those things we think will lead to a much better performance from existing customers. And having said that, as Jeff pointed out earlier, with provider enterprise base that we have in general, over time, we think we can do a better job of cross-selling into that. But obviously, that will take a little bit of time. But for the balance of the year, we see a lot of it coming from just existing customers."

We continued to execute on integration during the quarter, and progressed nicely on synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 32.3% in the second quarter of 2015, up from 29.4% on a pro forma basis in the",1773,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We continued to execute on integration during the quarter, and progressed nicely on synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to 32.3% in the second quarter of 2015, up from 29.4% on a pro forma basis in the second quarter of 2014. Over the last quarter, we continued to invest in product, network and system capabilities to position the company for revenue growth. 
Moving now to the second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Core Network Services revenue for the second quarter of 2015 grew 5.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 6.7%. Including integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $665 million. The company generated free cash flow of $102 million. To our year-to-date refinancing activities, we have reduced annualized interest expense by approximately $84 million and our leverage ratio is now at 4.1x. As of the end of the second quarter, we have achieved $115 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.4% on a constant currency basis and 2.9% on an as-reported basis. As we saw last quarter, the difference in growth rates is due to the strong dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 88% of CNS revenues as of the end of the second quarter, our top 3 foreign currencies are the British pound at 5%, the euro at 3%, the Brazilian real at 3%. On a revenue-weighted average basis, those 3 currencies declined 16% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth by approximately 2.5% this quarter. On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 6.7%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that we expected CNS revenue for North America to be a little softer than the 6.8% pro forma growth we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the incremental growth last year from Starbucks and some large federal contracts. Our outlook for the year remains consistent with these expectations. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 7.1% during the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to wholesale. CNS revenue grew 5.8% this quarter. In the quarter, we settled some disputes that led to an unusually strong performance in wholesale. In the third quarter, we expect wholesale CNS revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. For EMEA, we said that we expected a smaller decline compared to the 2.2% decline we saw last year in the region. For the first half of 2015, total CNS revenue for EMEA declined 1.8% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter of 2015, CNS revenue declined 2.7% on a constant currency basis and 12% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis and declined 3.5% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 9.8% on a constant currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis. As we said previously, we expect better performance from EMEA also this year, and we did see slight improvement compared to the prior quarter decline of 11%. 
U.K. government CNS revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 19% on an as-reported basis. In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis and declined 7% on an as-reported basis. At the beginning of the year, we said we expect comparable performance to the 8.5% CNS revenue growth we saw in 2014. For the year-to-date, CNS revenue in the region grew 5.9% on a constant currency basis, softer than we expected as macroeconomic and political issues persist. We continue to see headwinds in this area. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis and declined 7.6% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue grew 5.9% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.8% on an as-reported basis. 
Let me briefly touch on Venezuela. As we've been discussing, we are monitoring the situation in Venezuela and the macro environment has continued to worsen. At the end of the second quarter, at the SICAD 1 rate of VEF 12.8 to the dollar, the company had a cash balance equivalent of approximately USD 80 million. The June 30, 2015 Simadi exchange rate was VEF 197.3 to the dollar, but we're still transacting the majority of our business to the SICAD 1 rate. Our revenue in Venezuela in the second quarter was $24 million.
At the bottom of Slide 4, CNS revenue churn remained low at 1% during the quarter. On Slide 5, Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue, or WVS, declined 17% to $120 million in the second quarter 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. We have provided growth rates on a -- both on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services, which grew 8.1%, continue to drive the company's growth, led by growth in VPN services and managed and converged services. Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year. We do expect CDN performance to improve for the balance of the year, given the increased investment I referenced last quarter and from the interconnection agreements we signed this past quarter, which should relieve peering congestion. Transport and fiber grew 3%. And within that group, dark fiber grew 5.7%. Voice services grew 7.1% as a result of the North America wholesale settlement I mentioned earlier. Colocation and data services declined 0.2%. 
Turning to pricing. We continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. As a company, we spend a fair amount of time analyzing pricing dynamics. We take a market-based approach to pricing, looking at particular geographies, products, verticals and other factors. This has become an institutional capability for us as part of our focus on profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access margin expanded to 66.2% compared to 64.3% in the second quarter of 2014. The improvement in Network Access margin was driven in part by the high-margin settlement revenue I noted earlier and by integration-related network synergies. Continued CNS growth and WVS revenue declines also contributed to the improvement. Network-related expenses, excluding noncash compensation, was $359 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $357 million for the second quarter of 2014.
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation and integration-related expenses for the second quarter of 2015, was $336 million. This compares to $344 million for the second quarter of 2014. Year-over-year, the reduction in SG&A have been driven by synergies. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $665 million for the second quarter of 2015. Excluding integrated-related expenses of $5 million, adjusted EBITDA was $670 million. This compares to $597 million for the second quarter of 2014 or $605 million, excluding $8 million in transaction and integration costs that quarter. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by good progress in capturing operating expense synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses, improved to 32.3% compared to 29.4% for the second quarter of 2014. We feel good about our ability to continue expanding adjusted EBITDA margins as we recognized synergies, further optimize our cost structure and add high-margin CNS revenues. 
Moving to synergies. Since the acquisition closed, we've achieved approximately $115 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies with $25 million on Network Access cost synergies and $90 million of operating expense synergies. The focus going forward is around network synergies, which take a little longer to achieve compared to OpEx synergies. We continue to remain confident about our ability to achieve 70% or $140 million of our synergy targets by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $317 million in the second quarter of 2015 and are 14% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. The company generated free cash flow of $102 million in the quarter. As a result of the capital markets transactions completed during the quarter, our cash interest expense in the second quarter was a little higher than usual. Given our cash interest expense guidance of $640 million for 2015, we expect quarterly cash interest expense of about $160 million. In the second quarter, as a result of the refinancings, cash interest expense was $219 million. Year-to-date, our cash interest expense is $365 million. As of June 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $549 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.1x. This compares to 4.2x at the end of last quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x, which we expect to be driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our average interest rate on our debt is now 5.1% compared to 5.3% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6% -- 6.8% for Level 3 stand-alone in the second quarter of 2014. 
Turning to business outlook on Slide 11. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year. We are reiterating our outlook we've provided last quarter with 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 17% from a starting point of $2.271 billion pro forma for the tw telecom acquisition and including integration expenses. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million for the full year 2015. Given the capital markets activity in the quarter, we are lowering our interest expense outlook for the full year 2015 and now expect GAAP interest expense of approximately $650 million and net cash interest expense of approximately $640 million compared to our prior outlook of $660 million and $645 million, respectively. All other outlook measures remain unchanged. 
As we look to the third quarter of 2015, we expect to see our typical increase in utility costs generally in the high single-digit millions of dollars as a result of the higher summer cooling requirements in our data centers. Also, we don't -- we won't see the benefit of the second quarter dispute settlement that we saw in North America also in the third quarter. 
In summary, we are pleased with our progress on adjusted EBITDA growth and the continued margin expansion we've been able to achieve. For the second half of the year, we remain focused on integration and continue to recognize additional synergies. We're continuing to invest in the business both to drive profitable revenue growth and optimize cost. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

The successful integration of our company remains our top priority. In the past, many of you may have heard me talk about the notion of one that is so integral to our approach, combining and simplifying our product capabilities to create one portfolio of products regardless of geography, standardizing our network technologies and architectures to create one comprehensive global network and selecting and integrating our operational support systems to provide one operating environment for our employees and customers around the world. Each of these are key integration initiatives. 
On our first quarter earnings call, I noted that there have been no major surprises as part of the integration process. I'm pleased to say this remains true for the second quarter as well. Last quarter, I updated you on the various initiatives to integrate 2 sales teams of roughly equivalent size in North America. Account moves and organization realignments, CRM and other systems migrations as well as restructuring of the compensation plans are a few of the changes that impacted our sales team during the first few months of the year. For the past 90 days, we have not introduced any significant changes for the sales organization. While unwanted sales, forced attrition has ticked up slightly, we're paying very close attention to it. Having said that, attrition is still within our expectations. We remain focused on maintaining the sales momentum the 2 companies experienced prior to close. 
In the second quarter, CNS sales increased slightly both sequentially and year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As you've heard me say before, we're pleased, but not satisfied. I believe we can do more to make it easier for the sales force to cross-sell, up-sell, and improve overall productivity. I've been asked questions before about the competitiveness of our new combined offering and whether we can win more business than either of the previous companies could as stand-alone entities. I thought I would share one example: A recent deal with a company that is an intermediary for the information exchange between health plans and providers. They help to ease the complexity of moving business and clinical information to health care stakeholders nationwide. As a customer, both Level 3 and tw telecom, the company came to us with the need for an updated solution across their network. Their current solution included circuits from Level 3, tw telecom as well as other carriers. As a result of Level 3's now broader product portfolio and larger on-net footprint, we updated their full branch network into a single-carrier solution with higher throughput speeds on-net colocation and 100% physical diversity. This new solution is helping our customer keep pace with ever-changing regulatory and technology requirements. 
As we continue the integration of our products, networks and systems, we are laying the foundation for initiatives that are key is to driving future profitable growth, making it easier for customers to do business with Level 3, while also optimizing our cost structure creates more compelling offers in the market. As examples, we've completed the integration of all core security services to our in-state products and platforms. We're continuing to add capabilities to our managed security portfolio. Just after the close of the quarter, we announced that we are strengthening our capabilities in this area with the acquisition of Black Lotus. While not financially material, the acquisition brings important proxy-based DDoS mitigation services along with additional scrubbing centers and talented security professionals to the Level 3 team. We've standardized on a single Ethernet platform. And by platform, I mean, the product definitions, the network to deploy those products and the systems to support them. We've completed our rollout of the new Ethernet platform in North America and expect to complete the rollout in EMEA by the end of the year and Latin America in 2016. As one of the largest SDN deployments in our industry, these unified global capabilities will provide a differentiated experience for our customers in doing business in multiple locations as well as streamline Level 3 operations. We're investing to add CDN capacity around the world to meet growing demand in support of video and other content distributed online. We've worked diligently with industry partners to redefine interconnection and ensure access to an open Internet for all of our customers. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes sharing my perspectives on our LatAm and EMEA businesses. 
I spend a lot of time traveling in each of our 3 regions, meeting with management, employees and customers. As I mentioned on our last call, I was in Latin America in March. While Sunit described the continued pressure we see from the economic and political environment in the region, we are still growing the business and I believe we are well positioned to achieve stronger growth when the regional economic conditions improve. I returned last week from EMEA. I believe we're making progress in our efforts to return EMEA to growth. As you may have seen from the announcement yesterday, Andrew Crouch has now filled out his management team and we've hired key executives in sales, marketing and strategy, supplementing our already strong leaders in operations, finance, human resources and legal. While we continue to take advantage of our pan-European footprint, the top priorities for the team are to improve sales discipline, enhance customer targeting and drive more on-net buildings and network expansions in 4 territories within EMEA, the U.K., France, Germany and Benelux. We clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe we're taking the right steps to grow our market share and provide for long-term growth in this large market. 
Across the globe, CIOs are asked to help their companies grow, manage increasingly complex and demanding user needs, protect their company's data and network capabilities in an escalating and hostile environment, while at the same time, reducing their overall cost to operate. Whether using our sophisticated security services to protect their enterprise or coupling Level 3 Ethernet services with their internal SDN capabilities or using IP VPNs to tie together their offices around the world, our customers continue to transition to the flexible, scalable IP and optical services we provide to meet their evolving needs. 
At this point, I'd like to open it up to your questions. Operator, would you explain the process?"

Curious, if that's simply a result of that sales force integration in the first quarter and that book to bill and how that impacted the second quarter, and if the sales are starting to improve, if we could start to see improvement in the back half of this year. And then my second question is on EBITDA. If you simply annualize the EBITDA that you just recorded in the second quarter, you'd effectively be at 17% year-over-year, which would be at the high end of your guidance. Is that meant to imply that we could be seeing flat EBITDA or even down EBITDA in the back half of the year? Are you simply being conservative with your guidance?"

So our sales bookings were up sequentially and year-over-year. As far as the revenue goes, as we've been saying for 2 quarters now, that we're going to see a little softer performance over the balance of the year in North America because of the Starbucks and the federal contracts, the Starbucks revenue was ramping up this last year and some into the beginning of this year, and then we had some federal contracts that peeled off, that we talked about. So the performance is in line with what we -- in respect to North America. Enterprise is in line with what we've talked about. And so we're just seeing that basically. There's nothing that has changed fundamentally. I think the sales momentum is pretty good given the size of the combination of the 2 companies coming together, bringing them together in North America, and installing tools are holding up as you would expect for the kind of products and services we're selling.

I think you heard us say for quite a number of years that in general, for a longer period of time, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly down. And now we've been benefited last couple of quarters, at least in North America, with some settlements, particularly this past quarter. Our LatAm business is doing well because they're geared more towards consumer media and some of their wholesale customers. So I don't think anything's changed that for us. For us, the business continues to be a good profitable business for us, the margins in our wholesale business are comparable to what we've -- to our enterprise business, so we're happy with the profitability. In terms of the trends for the balance of the year, I mean, I think that -- there are 2 ways I've looked at it. One is with respect to our overall enterprise revenue, we do expect better sequential comparisons for the balance of the year. And we expect that the year-over-year enterprise trends will be consistent with what we've seen this quarter overall, specifically with respect to North America, I think we'll see on the margin, slight improvement, but consistent with what we reported this quarter. So in answer to your question, yes. I mean, the sales bookings should continue to benefit us. The year-over-year comparisons can get a little clouded by onetime things we had last year. As I mentioned, Starbucks and the federal contracts, which is why I mentioned the sequential point. So I think overall, given the size of the acquisition we did and everything -- all the changes we have going on, we're pretty -- we think performance is holding up as we expected in North America."

Is that because you're actually getting the integration done at a lower cost? Or is it timing? And then just wanted to expand on some of the comments you made about being an acquisitive company. You cited a couple of your growth regions as areas where you'd want to get more scale. Could you maybe define that a little bit when you say you want more scale? Does that mean you would like to have more assets similar to the type of assets you have in that region?

We have a better footprint. We have a better product portfolio, but we've got to migrate those things together. And so we have focused very hard on making sure our product definitions of the products are uniform, and so that you can sell our Ethernet service regardless of the building, regardless of the geography, meaning Europe or North America, you can sell a standard Ethernet product to your customer. We've also enhanced the capabilities, making sure that the SDN capabilities that we've built into our Ethernet product are available to our customers and that they understand how to utilize that within their infrastructure to take advantage of those capabilities. And so it starts with the product definitions. It also has to include, though, making sure that we have integrated the networks and the way that I talked about -- and again, I'll use the Ethernet example, but the way we've talked about with Ethernet, building the platform, so that across North America now, our customers, if they order new Ethernet services from us, they go across one system, they go across one network and they have one product definition regardless of where you're buying it. We're deploying that, as we speak, in EMEA, and we'll follow up in early parts of 2016, beginning deploying that in Latin America. And so the product definitions, the infrastructure, the support systems, all of those things are critical to drive better performance. We've already done a lot of the things that we needed to do from a sales organization. We've consolidated the customer relationship management systems, so we have one view of the customers. We've standardized our funneling process, and we've standardized our compensation. And so we've already started many of those activities and are starting to see the sales organization settle down into the new structure that we have and the new approach that we have. And then we also have to continue to move some of our lower in sales reps up market, and selling more to our sweet-spot customers. So customer targeting and making sure we're effectively using our sales force time, our other areas that we're really focused on."

Similarly in North America, we'll be on one billing platform by the end of the year. So as these progress, you do get efficiencies over time. With respect to your CDN question, yes, the situation that we faced at the beginning of this year was not having enough capacity on our network, which takes a couple of quarters to pull in. And the second issue we face was congestion on peering links, and you saw we made quite a bit of progress in the second quarter, signing interconnection agreements with a number of carriers. So the combination of both those things we think will lead to a much better performance from existing customers. And having said that, as Jeff pointed out earlier, with provider enterprise base that we have in general, over time, we think we can do a better job of cross-selling into that.

I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter,",1661,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. Core Network Services revenue for the third quarter 2015 grew 5.5%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.5%. North America CNS enterprise revenue grew 8.3% year-over-year and 2.6% on a sequential basis. 
Excluding integration related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $265 million and was $657 million, including those expenses. The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million. At the end of the third quarter, we achieved $170 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. I'd also like to mention that earlier today in our earnings release, we announced an accounting change in Latin America. In fact, in September 30, 2015, the company's deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries from future financial results. I'll give more detail regarding Venezuela in a moment. 
Additionally, based on our year-to-date performance, even with Venezuela excluded from our fourth quarter results and the higher integration expenses this quarter and currency headwinds in Brazil, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%, and continue to expect free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.5% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. As we've seen in previous quarters this year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 89% of CNS revenue as of the end of the third quarter, the British pound represented 5%, the euro 3% and the Brazilian real, 2%. All of the currencies are included in the remaining 1%. 
On a revenue Rated Avenue basis, the 3 largest currencies outside of the U.S. dollar declined 17% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth rate by approximately 2.8% this quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we saw the Brazilian real weakened 13% against the dollar compared to an average rates in the second quarter 2015. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 5.6%. From an enterprise perspective, we had a particularly strong third quarter with revenue growing 8.3% year-over-year and 2.7% on a sequential basis. We saw particular strength in professional services from the Federal segment that tends to be lumpy in nature. Also, CNS revenue declined 1.5% year-over-year in line with our expectations. 
In EMEA, CNS revenue increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.5% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.3% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. The sequential performance this quarter was driven by increases in CDN, professional services revenue and dispute settlements. Also, the CNS revenue declined 5.7% on a constant currency basis and 14% on an as-reported basis in line with our expectations. 
U.K. government CNS revenue saw a slight increase of 0.4% on a constant currency basis and a decline of 7.1% on an as-reported basis. Despite this quarter's increase, we still expect double-digit percentage declines in U.K. government revenue on a year-over-year basis. In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 9.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 9.0% on an as-reported basis. The sequential and year-over-year growth in Latin America this quarter was primarily due to increases in co-location and data center as well as IP and data revenue. Enterprise revenue grew 8.8% on a constant currency basis and declined 10% on an as-reported basis. 
Wholesale CNS revenue grew 10% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.9% on an as-reported basis. I'd like to take a moment to summarize the accounting changes we announced in this morning's earnings release. As we've been discussing for the past several quarters, the macroenvironment in Venezuela continues to worsen and we believe significant uncertainty exists regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela. These evolving conditions have resulted in a lack of exchange ability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and the inability to repatriate earnings from Venezuela back to the U.S. 
As a result, effective September 30, 2015, the company decided to deconsolidate Venezuelan subsidiary from its consolidated financial statements. Going forward, Level 3's reported financial results will not include revenue adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from Venezuela. Additionally, as we noted in our press release earlier today, this deconsolidation resulted in a onetime charge of $171 million. We remain committed to our operations, employees and customers in Venezuela and we'll continue to provide communication services there. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue or WVS declined 19% to $116 million in the third quarter of 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. We have provided growth rates on both -- on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services, which grew 9%, continue to drive the company's growth led by growth in VPN services and Internet access for enterprises. 
Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year but grew 5.9% on a sequential basis. Transport and fiber grew 3.8% and within that group, dark fiber grew 6.4%. Co-location and data center services grew 2.1% and voice services grew 0.6%. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. Each quarter, we analyzed pricing dynamics and take a market-based approach to pricing our solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals and other factors. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access cost was $706 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $717 million on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. Network Access margin expanded to 65.8% compared to 64.8% on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter 2015, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration related expenses, network-related expenses were $356 million. This compared to $365 million on a pro forma basis for the third quarter of 2014. 
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses for the third quarter 2015, was $325 million. This compares to $336 million for the third quarter of 2014. We also saw utility costs increased sequentially this quarter in the mid-single digit millions of dollars, lower than usual given the relatively cooler summer. Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $657 million for the third quarter 2015. Excluding $18 million of integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $675 million. This compares to $670 million for the second quarter 2015 or $665 million, including $5 million in integration costs and compares to $620 million for the third quarter 2014 or $612 million, including $8 million in transaction and integration cost that quarter. 
The integration related expenses this quarter of $18 million split into $8 million are network expenses and $10 million of SG&A. Integration related expenses this quarter were higher compared to the $5 million per quarter in the first half of the year due to an increase in headcount-related integration expenses. We expect that integration related expenses in the fourth quarter will return to a run rate similar to what we saw in the first half this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration related expenses improved to 31.9% compared to 30.0% for the third quarter 2014. Excluding integration related expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.7% compared to 30.4% for the third quarter of 2014. Moving to synergies. At the end of the third quarter, we have achieved $170 million of run rate savings. We are running ahead of schedule in terms of reaching our 18-month target of $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016. We remain confident in hitting our overall synergy target of $200 million. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $328 million in the third quarter 2015 and are 15% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million in the quarter compared to $139 million from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $691 million, which benefited from our free cash flow during the quarter, and was negatively impacted by $83 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.0x. This compares to 4.1x at both the end of last quarter and from the year-ago quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x. Additionally, during the quarter, Level 3's corporate credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to BA3 from B2. Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch radar corporate at BB-. 
We are confident in our full-year financial performance despite the change in our coming Venezuelan operations and continue currency headwinds. We have updated of our outlook and now expect 215 adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%. We continue to expect to generate $600 million to $650 million of free cash flow for the full year 2015. 
All other outlook measures remain unchanged. In summary, while still have work ahead of us at integration, we made a fair amount of progress. From a financial perspective, we are seeing steady performance in the business and remain focused on delivering profitable growth. With that, I look forward to providing an update on our full year result in February and will now turn the call over to Jeff."
30771,312658728,883635,"Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Level 3 Parent, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sunit. As you heard from Sunit's remarks, we had good performance in all of our regions this quarter. While our results are rarely linear and frequently lumpy from 1 quarter to the next, we continue to drive profitable growth and are successful",1500,"Thank you, Sunit. As you heard from Sunit's remarks, we had good performance in all of our regions this quarter. While our results are rarely linear and frequently lumpy from 1 quarter to the next, we continue to drive profitable growth and are successful in converting that growth into strong free cash flow. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're a few days away from the 1-year anniversary of the tw telecom acquisition. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration. 
Before I get into the integration details though, I'd like to announce that John Blount, our North America regional President, will be retiring at the end of 2015. I'd like to personally thank John for all of his contributions. Early on in the acquisition process, John and I both saw the fundamental role he could take and the importance of his leadership during the integration. Even prior to closing, John spent 6 months or so leading the integration planning from the tw telecom side. Over the last year, John has been a tremendous asset in guiding our North America business and many of our integration efforts. John is committed to a 6-month consulting agreement, so I feel very fortunate that I'll have the benefit of his advice and perspective well into 2016. 
From an integration perspective. While we have more work to do, we've made significant progress across numerous fronts. During the last year, we've combined 2 large sales organizations, realigned around a common general manager structure, implemented a uniform go to market strategy, established a global account management team to serve our largest customers globally, standardized sales compensation and deployed a single CRM platform meanwhile, maintaining voluntary sales attrition well within our expectations and continuing to grow sales production each quarter. 
We defined and deployed a global purpose built Ethernet platform, it's not a hodgepodge deployment of new and old technologies that form the foundation of many Ethernet network. This is a fully architected SDN-enabled platform, designed to deliver Ethernet service in a differentiated customer experience to our enterprise of wholesale customers. We've merged the IP, MPLS and voice networks across the company, reducing complexity and cost, and increasing flexibility going forward. We combined our service insurance internal ticketing systems in North America and are working on a consistent global environment. 
We completed the integration of our global ERP systems into a single platform worldwide and are well on our way to consolidating the former tw billing system into the go forward Level 3 billing environment. And lastly, we are pleased with the synergy realization that all of these initiatives have made possible. Again, while integration is not complete, we are well on our way and are pleased with the progress we've made. 
With respect to the replacement for John, 80% of our revenues in North America and almost all of our integration activities are focused here. As you might imagine, I already spent a significant amount of time focused on the region. John's leadership team is excellent with broad experience and focused on delivering for our customers. As a result of these 2 factors, I do not intend to appoint an interim lead. Until we replace John, I will continue to spend my time ensuring we are driving our growth and executing our integration plan within the region. 
We do have a number of excellent internal candidates and we'll look externally as well, but we'll not be in a rush to fill the position. I'll move on now to a question many of you asked me from time to time. You ask, why does Level 3 win? There are really 2 parts to the answer. The first is about the market. The need for the services and capabilities Level 3 provides is strong and growing. The second is about Level 3 itself. Our ability to effectively meet those customer needs is also strong and growing. 
You've heard me talk about technology transitions accelerating and how the move to a digital world affects every aspect of our work and lives. As a result, the operating environment for CIOs is becoming more and more complex. The demand for ever-increasing capacity and bandwidth has not slowed. Just a few years ago, explosives bandwidth demand was limited to a few industries like social media, financial services and health care. Today, you'd be hard-pressed to find an industry that does not require a scalable, reliable bandwidth to meet their needs for growth. Until a few years ago, CIOs control the application of an enterprise. The hardware those applications ran on and the devices we use to connect with them. Today, the applications may be homegrown or cloud-based. Even homegrown applications are likely to run somewhere in the cloud over virtualized computing resources and we all bring our own devices to the workplaces. 
Meanwhile, security threats continue to escalate. DDOS attacks had more than doubled over the last 12 months and system intrusions and data exfiltration have become almost a commonplace. Security is a critical focus for our customers and they recognize the need for securing their services in multiple ways within the enterprise, at the interface between the enterprise and the network provider and within the core of the network itself. While the environment is more complex, CIOs are also being asked to improve overall performance of their systems and reduce expenses at the same time. 
So that's the environment. But why do we win? Level 3 is invested in our products and our capabilities to take advantage of these dynamic environments and continually improve our execution and the customer experience we provide. First of all, we are 100% focused on the wireline needs of enterprise customers. We're not distracted by wireless, by consumers or by pay television. We do sell wholesale customers but even then, we're really targeting the needs of enterprises of those full sail providers serve. Wireline enterprise network isn't a piece of our business. It isn't an add-on to our business, it is our business. 
Level 3's expertise and experience in deploying and managing large-scale, complex, global IP and optical networks is not easy to come by and allows us to provide a differentiated experience for our customers. We're not mired in technologies of the past. Rather, we continually look at where customers needs are going and how our technology should evolve. We have a product portfolio available globally that's designed to create comprehensive solutions for customers whether dark fiber, Ethernet transport, public IP, CDN or a host of voice services. We're able to implement a wide range of network solutions to meet an enterprises global needs. We're an outstanding still leader. We're heavily investing in integrating SDN and the virtualization of network functionality into our product portfolio and our operating environment, preparing Level 3 for the next wave of dramatic network evolution. 
Our operating model and our go-to-market strategy are aimed at providing an excellent customer experience with regional and local management focused on where customers buying decisions are made. From a security perspective. We have the situational awareness and the ability to implement security capabilities at the edge and in the core of the network to assist and securing enterprises digital environment. The bottom line is we have an integrated and comprehensive approach to addressing our customers network challenges and the fiber-based network to meet those needs around the world. 
Sunit has already covered our results for the quarter, so I won't spend time repeating, but I'll add a couple of comments. Looking at North America, enterprise CNS revenue continues to be the key. This quarter, we grew at 2.6% sequentially or 8.3% year-over-year. In EMEA, I believe we're making progress. We have an excellent team in place and excluding the U.K. government, we are stabilizing the business. The team has done a good job of extending the life of several U.K. government contracts, but as Sunit mentioned, we continue to expect double-digit declines. 
Moving to Latin America. I'd like to comment on the accounting change related to Venezuela. Let me reiterate that we remain committed to the market, particularly to our employees and customers in the country. I'd like to thank our employees in Venezuela for their ongoing commitment to providing excellent service our customers in a very difficult environment. 
For the region as a whole, the macroenvironment continues to be challenging. As I noted last quarter, the demand for our services remains strong and we still see opportunity to grow the business to meet our customers needs across the region as we saw from our results in the quarter. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to commend the SEC for their action earlier this month to investigate incumbent special access terrorists. Level 3 strongly supports a competitive marketplace and we believe the elimination of these demand lockup agreements will create a more competitive industry and fuel investment and innovation. 
Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, will you explain the process?"

And then second question on North America enterprise. Jeff, we appreciate you weighing out the Y Level 3 wins. And I guess, as we head into year-end and look into 2016 and growth looks to be shaping up around 8% in North America enterprise, do you think the market as we head into 2016 would support the same type of growth or maybe even something faster going forward."

In this quarter in particularly as I said, the synergies came more from the headcount related side expenses. So we had some reductions in various areas as we have integrated the platforms. And I think as we lookout -- yes, we're certainly running ahead of the 1 40 [ph] we said, we had hit at the end of the first quarter next year and I think that we're certainly running quite a bit closer to the ultimate $200 million target that we had set for ourselves, I would say ahead of schedule at this point."

First with respect to the SEC and I won't quantify what it means for us, but I'll talk about the environment that it creates. Today, many of the incumbents have what we considered demand lockup agreements. It prevents customers from going to somebody else because they lose discount in all of their services and takes a little bit of their services with some of their providers. That constrains the ability of customers to move their traffic to Level 3. So if we eliminate those demand lockup agreements and the FCC is investigating them and they're asking the appropriate questions about them, if they were to decide to eliminate the demand lockup agreements then there's a lot of opportunity for us. But today is not really addressable. Even though companies want to move services to us, even though we can provide a better solution for them, they don't have the ability to move because they lose their discounts on their embedded-based services if they do. So we think it's a very positive event. We look forward to the SEC making final rulings and we'll be very actively for dissipating in their process to provide them with our insight and our input in the process. With respect to Comcast. Comcast is a very good company. They're an excellent customer of Level 3, there are a vendor to Level 3, there a partner of Level 3. So they're a very good company. They've done a very good job at the small and of business customers that we don't take them lightly. And don't discount them in anyway whatsoever. However, Level 3 already operates in a very competitive environment and it's a competitive environment globally for capabilities delivered around the world, not just in North America, not just in India, but around the world our customers need our services and capability. We are very good at competing with companies that have been doing this for 100 years. Companies that have major shares of the market and we've been -- we've exceeded their performance if you look at ours versus theirs over the past few years. And so we're very comfortable about our competitive position and about the products and services that we sell to those customers. And so this feels like we have competitors come and go in the market and this feels more like the same . Will continue to focus on our execution on our products and services and into delivering customer experience that no one can match over a network that no one can match."

It's integral to the way that they want to buy. In North America, it's not as integral. People want to buy data center separately. They don't care if it's connected. It may be separate, they don't care of its connected the transporter long-haul are any of those other services. EMEA is a little bit in between the 2. So our strategy varies a little bit based on the market that we're talking about and how we're cooperating. But in general, we're pleased with our data center portfolio. It tends to be a little more telco-based than the high-end data centers with all the newest capabilities. So we tend to be a little bit lower than those really high-end data centers. But when our customers need those types of services, we're very good at partnering with other companies to make sure that we have data center space that's appropriate for our customers. As a good example, there's of the center in Omaha that's a world-class data center. We were one of the anchor tenant in there so we took down space so that when our customers have a need for that, we can easily put them in there. And then we can grow and expand our capabilities to match the needs that we have in the marketplace. I want us to be better, frankly, in datac enter revenue segment can do better in selling the services and growing the business, but overall, we're pleased with our portfolio and have an answer to get into the really high-end data centers that may be building ourselves doesn't make sense."

Obviously, as you buy start to generate more and more free cash flow optionality, becoming a bigger part of the discussion on both on the buy side and the sell-side. Jeff I was hoping you could provide to us with the company's current policy is around things like buybacks and so forth. And if there isn't one in place or view now, when can we expect you to have a more formalized approach to that? And on my second question is, your EBITDA went up in terms of the low end of year guidance. You maintained your free cash flow guidance. I'm guessing there might've been something very related to Venezuela in terms of why free cash flow didn't also go up, and more clarity on that."

So I think what we're is seeing some of the particular of the strength in the third quarter came from the areas that I mentioned. I won't comment specifically whether you backed that out into fourth quarter, but obviously, use all particular strength we were above the sort of goal of 2% sequential growth or 48% year-on-year in enterprise. And then I think on your questions on free cash flow and EBITDA guidance, there are a lot of things happening. Clearly, you saw most of the EBITDA in Venezuela does translate to the cash flow line because there wasn't that much capital spending there. And so that was a negative. We obviously, had higher cash integration expenses here in the third quarter. So I think as we added up everything together, we still think the free cash flow range we had continues to be the right range, which is why we reaffirmed that. And then as it pertains to our cash flow and returning capital, I'll make a few comments and Jeff can add onto that. But I think in general, we -- Level 3 is a growth company. We focus on growth and we get pretty high operating and investment leverage from the existing networks we have. We get very high returns so we prefer to do that. Beyond that, as you've seen, we participate in historically in a consolidation and acquisition that continues to be a good use of money to deploy larger amounts of capital at pretty attractive returns. If we're not as successful in putting everything of our money to work there certainly, buybacks make a lot of sense. Or if your share prices do not value our growth prospects properly, returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, certainly make a lot of sense and that would be a preference versus dividends for example. So at least that's our current thinking. Having said that, as Jeff has mentioned in the past, as we have undergone this cash flow transformation, this is a subject that we have more to speak about, talk about over the next few quarters."

It's to go in and understand our customers need with a direct sales force that talks to our customers, and listens to our customers and comes up with solution, not just we're going to sell the services that product who want to come up with solutions that meet their needs. So that sales approach continues to be the same.

I'll divide my comments into 2 categories, one, from a product perspective and then two, from a vertical perspective. From a products perspective, I would say that the biggest thing driving is as enterprises need for IP and data and as enterprises move to more hybrid network, it's both in IP VPN networks, Internet access or enterprises good growth areas for us, security and CDN services merging services, but we see good growth from that especially CDN, sequentially. We think that will continue. As I said earlier, professional services is lumpy but in general, that's a good category for us as people transition to more cloud-based solutions. The story is little bit different by region as Jeff pointed out in Latin America. From an industry vertical perspective, I think the biggest growth driver continues to be from the technology and media software sector so some of the big with both companies are driving a fair bit of growth and then also some of the big media companies as they move to virtualize their platforms and have them in the clouds. Some of you for example, might have noticed things like the NFL game in London where we can carry all the Internet, which is [indiscernible] so those sorts of things, generally we are a beneficiary of. More recently, we've seen also good growth from the manufacturing sector of the automotive sector being one of them. Healthcare continues to be a growth sector for us as the financial sector. We see a lot of opportunity over the next years in areas like energy where we have a low market share. As companies are looking to save a lot of money as they transition their infrastructure. So the emerging sectors where we have a low market share that we see as good growth areas for us."

Geographically, I think we -- most of our CapEx is success base. So it's driven by where the businesses is coming from. So you -- as you would expect, the vast majority of our capital goes into North America. But areas like Latin America, which are growing at faster growth rates, we tend to allocate capital at a higher percent of revenue. Areas like EMEA, where we are trying to reposition the business for growth, we're allocating capital at a higher percent of revenues than their revenues compared to the overall 15 [ph]. This year, there is a lot of comical being spent on integration. You heard Jeff talk about all the various platforms that we are consolidating. That effort will continue over the next couple of years in areas like order entry to provisioning to inventory over the next year or 2. Some efforts in billing. And then in terms of product areas. As we indicated earlier this year, we made a pretty significant investment to expand the capacity of CDN network. That was $50 million over the last year or so we invested about 35-plus-million dollars to build a branch off of our subsea network in Latin America into Colombia with the lending station. We've spent money in expanding our datacenter capabilities in Latin America. We have spent money in terms of doing network expansions in the U.S. We're still maintaining a base of adding 2,500 to 3,000 new buildings a year. I think this last quarter, we added about 700 buildings on that buildings, to the network of that continues to be a focus for us. The other area, we've spent money in the security area. And as we look at next year, I think we see continued expansion in our security capability, including CDN. And then for the network expansions in Europe, we're -- Continental Europe as we look to expand our presence there. So these are some of the areas. And Jeff might have other things."

We see disadvantages to consumers and to the marketplace when companies refuse to interconnect.

We'll continue to focus and there are a few standouts that we will continue to work on to get better interconnection with them. With respect to M&A. In any particular region, we just look at the opportunities that are out there and respond to those opportunities. I've said it before, but you have to have a willing buyer and a willing seller and so some markets, there may be more willing sellers than we're a willing buyer. In other markets, that may not be opportunity for us to buy something that we find compelling. So we're opportunistic. We stay in touch and engaged in all of the various regions across a range of things, not just fiber providers, but security, managed services, professional services. We pay attention to a range of different things to see if there's something out there that make sense for us. But we are opportunistic and we'll continue to be so. 
With that, thank you very much, James for the final question. I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. We delivered a solid quarter of growth in our enterprise business. While we have more to do, we made good integration progress since the closing of the tw telecom acquisition a year ago. We continue to demonstrate our ability and our discipline to ramp free cash flow through our focus on profitable CNS revenue growth, synergy realization, other cost optimization initiatives and reducing interest expense, we remain firmly committed to increasing free cash flow on a per share basis. At the same time, we're investing in the business for future revenue growth and to meet the demanding and evolving needs of enterprise customers. As always, thank you for joining today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call."

I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter,",1661,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. Core Network Services revenue for the third quarter 2015 grew 5.5%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.5%. North America CNS enterprise revenue grew 8.3% year-over-year and 2.6% on a sequential basis. 
Excluding integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $675 million and was $657 million, including those expenses. The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million. At the end of the third quarter, we achieved $170 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. I'd also like to mention that earlier today, in our earnings release, we announced an accounting change in Latin America. In fact, in September 30, 2015, the company is deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries from future financial results. I'll give more detail regarding Venezuela in a moment. 
Additionally, based on our year-to-date performance, even with Venezuela excluded from our fourth quarter results and the higher integration expenses this quarter and currency headwinds in Brazil, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%, and continue to expect free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.5% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. As we have seen in previous quarters this year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 89% of CNS revenue as of the end of the third quarter, the British pound represented 5%, the euro 3% and the Brazilian real, 2%. All of the currencies are included in the remaining 1%. 
On a revenue-weighted average basis, the 3 largest currencies outside of the U.S. dollar declined 17% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth rate by approximately 2.8% this quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we saw the Brazilian real weakened 13% against the dollar compared to an average rates in the second quarter 2015. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 5.6%. From an enterprise perspective, we had a particularly strong third quarter with revenue growing 8.3% year-over-year and 2.7% on a sequential basis. We saw particular strength in professional services from the Federal segment that tends to be lumpy in nature. Also, CNS revenue declined 1.5% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. 
In EMEA, CNS revenue increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.5% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.3% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. The sequential performance this quarter was driven by increases in CDN, professional services revenue and dispute settlements. Also, the CNS revenue declined 5.7% on a constant currency basis and 14% on an as-reported basis in line with our expectations. 
U.K. government CNS revenue saw a slight increase of 0.4% on a constant currency basis and a decline of 7.1% on an as-reported basis. Despite this quarter's increase, we still expect double-digit percentage declines in U.K. government revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 9.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 9.0% on an as-reported basis. The sequential and year-over-year growth in Latin America this quarter was primarily due to increases in colocation and data center as well as IP and data revenue. Enterprise revenue grew 8.8% on a constant currency basis and declined 10% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue grew 10% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.9% on an as-reported basis. 
I'd like to take a moment to summarize the accounting changes we announced in this morning's earnings release. As we've been discussing for the past several quarters, the macroenvironment in Venezuela continues to worsen, and we believe significant uncertainty exists regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela. These evolving conditions have resulted in a lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and the inability to repatriate earnings from Venezuela back to the U.S. 
As a result, effective September 30, 2015, the company decided to deconsolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary from its consolidated financial statements. Going forward, Level 3's reported financial results will not include revenue adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from Venezuela. Additionally, as we noted in our press release earlier today, this deconsolidation resulted in a onetime charge of $171 million. We remain committed to our operations, employees and customers in Venezuela and will continue to provide communication services there. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue or WVS declined 19% to $116 million in the third quarter of 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. We have provided growth rates on both, on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services, which grew 9%, continue to drive the company's growth led by growth in VPN services and Internet access for enterprises. 
Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year but grew 5.9% on a sequential basis. transport and fiber grew 3.8% and within that group, dark fiber grew 6.4%. Colocation and datacenter services grew 2.1%, and voice services grew 0.6%. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. Each quarter, we analyze pricing dynamics and take a market-based approach to pricing our solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals and other factors. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access Costs was $706 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $717 million on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. Network Access margin expanded to 65.8% compared to 64.8% on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter 2015, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses, network-related expenses were $356 million. This compared to $365 million on a pro forma basis for the third quarter of 2014. 
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses for the third quarter 2015 was $325 million. This compares to $336 million for the third quarter of 2014. We also saw utility costs increased sequentially this quarter in the mid-single digit millions of dollars, lower than usual given the relatively cooler summer. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $657 million for the third quarter 2015. Excluding $18 million of integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $675 million. This compares to $670 million for the second quarter 2015 or $665 million, including $5 million in integration costs and compares to $620 million for the third quarter 2014 or $612 million, including $8 million in transaction and integration costs that quarter. 
The integration-related expenses this quarter of $18 million split into $8 million are network expenses and $10 million of SG&A. Integration related expenses this quarter were higher compared to the $5 million per quarter in the first half of the year due to an increase in headcount-related integration expenses. We expect that integration-related expenses in the fourth quarter will return to a run rate similar to what we saw in the first half this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses improved to 31.9% compared to 30.0% for the third quarter 2014. Excluding integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.7% compared to 30.4% for the third quarter of 2014. 
Moving to synergies. At the end of the third quarter, we have achieved $170 million of run rate savings. We are running ahead of schedule in terms of reaching our 18-month target of $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016. We remain confident in hitting our overall synergy target of $200 million. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $328 million in the third quarter 2015 and are 15% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. 
The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million in the quarter compared to $139 million from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $691 million, which benefited from our free cash flow during the quarter and was negatively impacted by $83 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.0x. This compares to 4.1x at both the end of last quarter and from the year-ago quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x. Additionally, during the quarter, Level 3's corporate credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to BA3 from B2. Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch radar corporate credit at BB-. 
We are confident in our full year financial performance despite the change in economy for our Venezuelan operations and continued currency headwinds. We have updated our outlook and now expect 215 (sic) [ 2015] adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%. We continue to expect to generate $600 million to $650 million of free cash flow for the full year 2015. All other outlook measures remain unchanged. 
In summary, while we still have work ahead of us on integration, we made a fair amount of progress. From a financial perspective, we are seeing steady performance in the business and remain focused on delivering profitable growth. With that, I look forward to providing everyone an update on our full year results in February. I will now turn the call over to Jeff."

As you heard from Sunit's remarks, we saw a good performance in all of our regions this quarter. While our results are rarely linear and frequently lumpy from 1 quarter to the next, we continue to drive profitable growth and are successful in converting that growth into strong free cash flow. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're a few days away from the 1-year anniversary of the tw telecom acquisition. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration. 
Before I get into the integration details, though, I'd like to announce that John Blount, our North America regional President, will be retiring at the end of 2015. I'd like to personally thank John for all of his contributions. Early on in the acquisition process, John and I both saw the fundamental role he could take and the importance of his leadership during the integration. Even prior to closing, John spent 6 months or so leading the integration planning from the tw telecom side. Over the last year, John has been a tremendous asset in guiding our North America business and many of our integration efforts. John is committed to a 6-month consulting agreement, so I feel very fortunate that I'll have the benefit of his advice and perspectives well into 2016. 
From an integration perspective. While we have more work to do, we've made significant progress across numerous fronts. During the last year, we've combined 2 large sales organizations, realigned around a common general manager structure, implemented a uniform go-to-market strategy, established a global account management team to serve our largest customers globally, standardized sales compensation and deployed a single CRM platform meanwhile, maintaining voluntary sales attrition well within our expectations and continuing to grow sales production each quarter. 
We defined and deployed a global purpose-built Ethernet platform. It's not a hodgepodge deployment of new and old technologies that form the foundation of many Ethernet networks. This is a fully architected SDN-enabled platform, designed to deliver Ethernet services and a differentiated customer experience to our enterprise and wholesale customers. 
We've merged the spirit IP, MPLS and voice networks across the company, reducing complexity and costs and increasing flexibility going forward. We combined our service insurance internal ticketing systems in North America and are working on a consistent global environment. 
We completed the integration of our global ERP systems into a single platform worldwide and are well on our way to consolidating the former tw telecom billing system into the go-forward Level 3 billing environment. And lastly, we are pleased with the synergy realization that all of these initiatives have made possible. Again, while integration is not complete, we are well on our way and are pleased with the progress we've made. 
With respect to the replacement for John, 80% of our revenues in North America and almost all of our integration activities are focused here. As you might imagine, I already spent a significant amount of time focused on the region. John's leadership team is excellent with broad experience and focused on delivering for our customers. As a result of these 2 factors, I do not intend to appoint an interim lead. Until we replace John, I will continue to spend my time ensuring we are driving our growth and executing our integration plan within the region. 
We do have a number of excellent internal candidates, and we'll look externally as well but will not be in a rush to fill the position. 
I'll move on now to a question many of you asked me from time to time. You ask, why does Level 3 win? There are really 2 parts to the answer. The first is about the market. The need for the services and capabilities Level 3 provides is strong and growing. The second is about Level 3 itself. Our ability to effectively meet those customer needs is also strong and growing. 
You've heard me talk about technology transitions accelerating and how the move to a digital world affects every aspect of our work and lives. As a result, the operating environment for CIOs is becoming more and more complex. The demand for ever-increasing capacity and bandwidth has not slowed. Just a few years ago, explosives bandwidth demand was limited to a few industries, like social media, financial services and health care. Today, you'd be hard-pressed to find an industry that does not require scalable, reliable bandwidth to meet their needs for growth. Until a few years ago, CIOs controlled the applications of an enterprise, the hardware those applications ran on and the devices we use to connect with them. 
Today, the applications may be homegrown or cloud-based. Even homegrown applications are likely to run somewhere in the cloud over virtualized computing resources, and we all bring our own devices to the workplaces. 
Meanwhile, security threats continue to escalate. DDOS attacks had more than doubled over the last 12 months and system intrusions and data exfiltration have become almost a commonplace. Security is a critical focus for our customers and they recognize the need for securing their services in multiple ways within the enterprise, at the interface between the enterprise and the network provider and within the core of the network itself. While the environment is more complex, CIOs are also being asked to improve overall performance of their systems and reduce expenses at the same time. 
So that's the environment, but why do we win? Level 3 is invested in our products and our capabilities to take advantage of these dynamic environment and continually improve our execution and the customer experience we provide. First of all, we are 100% focused on the wireline needs of enterprise customers. We're not distracted by wireless, by consumers or by pay television. We do sell wholesale customers, but even then, we're really targeting the needs of enterprises that those wholesale providers serve. Wireline enterprise network isn't a piece of our business. It isn't an add-on to our business. It is our business. 
Level 3's expertise and experience in deploying and managing large-scale, complex global IP and optical networks is not easy to come by and allows us to provide a differentiated experience for our customers. We're not mired in technologies of the past, rather we continually look at where customers needs are going and now -- how our technology should evolve. 
We have a product portfolio available globally that's designed to create comprehensive solutions for customers. Whether dark fiber, Ethernet transport, public IP, CDN or a host of voice services, we're able to implement a wide range of network solutions to meet an enterprise's global needs. 
We're not standing still leader. We're heavily investing in integrating SDN and the virtualization of network functionality into our product portfolio and our operating environment, preparing Level 3 for the next wave of dramatic network evolution. 
Our operating model and our go-to-market strategy are aimed at providing an excellent customer experience with regional and local management focused on where customers buying decisions are made. 
From a security perspective, we have the situational awareness and the ability to implement security capabilities at the edge and in the core of the network to assist and securing enterprises digital environment. The bottom line is we have an integrated and comprehensive approach to addressing our customers network challenges and the fiber-based network to meet those needs around the world. 
Sunit has already covered our results for the quarter so I won't spend time repeating, but I'll add a couple of comments. Looking at North America, enterprise CNS revenue continues to be the key. This quarter, we grew at 2.6% sequentially or 8.3% year-over-year. In EMEA, I believe we're making progress. We have an excellent team in place, and excluding the U.K. government, we are stabilizing the business. The team has done a good job of extending the life of several of the U.K. government contracts, but as Sunit mentioned, we continue to expect double-digit declines. 
Moving to Latin America. I'd like to comment on the accounting change related to Venezuela. Let me reiterate that we remain committed to the market, particularly to our employees and customers in the country. I'd like to thank our employees in Venezuela for their ongoing commitment to providing excellent service to our customers in a very difficult environment. 
For the region as a whole, the macroenvironment continues to be challenging. As I noted last quarter, the demand for our services remains strong and we still see opportunity to grow the business to meet our customers needs across the region, as we saw from our results in the quarter. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to commend the SEC for their action earlier this month to investigate incumbent special access terrorists. Level 3 strongly supports a competitive marketplace, and we believe the elimination of these demand lock-up agreements will create a more competitive industry and fuel investment and innovation. 
Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, will you explain the process?"

I think the network expense side has been running at or a little slower than the pace we'd like, but we've been running quite a bit of ahead, and I think a lot of that, as Jeff pointed out, has to do with a lot of the platforms we put in place already, which allows us to cut a lot of work internally and to be -- to drive that. 
In this quarter in particular, as I said, the synergies came more from the headcount-related side expenses so we had some reductions in various areas as we have integrated the platforms. And I think as we look out -- yes, we're certainly running ahead of the $140 million we said. We had hit at the end of the first quarter next year, and I think that we're certainly running quite a bit closer to the ultimate $200 million target that we had set for ourselves. I would say ahead of schedule at this point."

First, with respect to the SEC, and I won't quantify what it means for us, but I'll talk about the environment that it creates. Today, many of the incumbents have what we considered demand lock-up agreements. It prevents customers from going to somebody else because they lose discounts in all of their services. It takes a little bit of their services with some other their provider. That constraints stray. That constraints the ability of customers to move their traffic to Level 3. So if we eliminate those demand lock-up agreements, and the FCC is investigating them, and they're asking the appropriate questions about them, if they were to decide to eliminate those demand lock-up agreements, then there's a lot of opportunity for us. But today, it's is not really addressable. Even though companies want to move services to us, even though we can provide a better solution for them, they don't have the ability to move because they lose their discounts on their embedded base of services if they do. So we think it's a very positive event. We look forward to the SEC making final rulings, and we'll be very actively participating in their process to provide them with our insight and our input in the process. 
With respect to Comcast, Comcast is a very good company. They're an excellent customer of Level 3. They're a vendor to Level 3. They're a partner of Level 3. So they're a very good company. They've done a very good job at the small end of business customers that we don't take them lightly and don't discount them in any way whatsoever. However, Level 3 already operates in a very competitive environment and its competitive environment globally for capabilities delivered around the world, not just in North America, not just in EMEA, but around the world, our customers need our services and capability. 
We are very good at competing with companies that have been doing this for 100 years, companies that have major shares of the market, and we've been -- we've exceeded their performance if you look at ours versus theirs over the past few years. And so we're very comfortable about our competitive position and about the products and services that we sell to those customers. And so this feels like -- we have competitors come and go in the market, and this feels like more of the same.

Our datacenter strategy is tightly coupled with our regional strategy. If you look in Latin America, datacenter is an integral part of the way customers buy our other services, our transport services, our -- the various long-haul capabilities and other metro services. It's integral to the way that they want to buy. 
In North America, it's not as integral. Customers want to buy datacenter separately. They don't care if it's connected. It may be separate, they don't care of its connected the transporter long-haul are any of those other services. 
EMEA is a little bit in between the 2. So our strategy varies a little bit based on the market that we're talking about and how we're cooperating. But in general, we're pleased with our data center portfolio. It tends to be a little more telco-based than the high-end data centers with all the newest capabilities. So we tend to be a little bit lower than those really high-end datacenters. But when our customers need those types of services, we're very good at partnering with other companies to make sure that we have datacenter space that's appropriate for our customers. As a good example, there's a datacneter in Omaha that's a world-class datacenter. We were one of the anchor tenants in there. So that we took down space so that when our customers have a need for that, we can easily put them in there, and then we can grow and expand our capabilities to match the needs that we have in the marketplace. 
I want us to be better, frankly, in datacenter revenues. I think we can do better in selling the services and growing the business. But overall, we're pleased with our portfolio and have an answer for getting into the really high-end datacenters that may be building ourselves doesn't make sense."

And if there isn't one in place or view now, when can we expect you to have a more formalized approach to that?

I mean, until the end of the quarter, you don't know what ends up being the case until you finish the quarter. So I think what we're is seeing some of the particular strength in the third quarter came from the areas that I mentioned. I won't comment specifically on whether you backed that out into fourth quarter, but obviously, you saw particular strength. We were above the sort of goal of 2% sequential growth or 8% year-on-year in enterprise. And then, I think on your questions on free cash flow and EBITDA guidance, I see a lot of things happening. Clearly, you saw the -- most of the EBITDA in Venezuela does translate to the cash flow line because there wasn't that much in capital spending there. And so that was a negative. We obviously had higher cash integration expenses here in the third quarter. So I think as we added up everything together, we still think the free cash flow range we had continues to be the right range, which is why we reaffirm that. And then as it pertains to our cash flow and returning capital, I'll make a few comments, and Jeff can add onto that. But I think in general, we -- Level 3 is a growth company. We focus on growth and we get pretty high operating and investment leverage from the existing networks we have. We get very high returns so we prefer to do that. Beyond that, as you've seen, we participate historically in a table of consolidation and acquisition that continues to be a good use of money to deploy large amounts of capital at pretty attractive returns. If we're not as successful in putting everything of our money to work there, certainly, buybacks make a lot of sense. Or if your share prices do not value our growth prospects properly, returning capital to shareholders through buybacks certainly make a lot of sense, and that would be our preference versus dividends, for example. So at least that's our current thinking. Having said that, as Jeff has mentioned in the past, as we have undergone this cash flow transformation, this is a subject that we would love more to speak about over -- talk about in the next few quarters."

From a product perspective, I would say that the biggest thing driving us is enterprise's need for IP and data. And as enterprises move to more hybrid networks, it's both in IP VPN networks, Internet access or enterprises good growth areas for us, security and CDN, our emerging services, but we see good growth from that especially CDN. Sequentially, we think that will continue. As I said earlier, professional services is lumpy, but in general, that's a good category for us as people transition to more cloud-based solutions. 
The story is little bit different by region, as Jeff pointed out, for datacenters in Latin America. From an industry vertical perspective, I think the biggest growth driver continues to be from the technology and media software sector. So some of the big West Coast companies are driving a fair bit of growth, and then also some of the big media companies as they move to virtualize their platforms and have them in the cloud. Some of you, for example, might have noticed things like the NFL game in London over the weekend carried over  the Internet, which is plus. So those sorts of things, generally, we are a beneficiary of. 
More recently, we've seen also good growth from the manufacturing sector, the automotive sector being one of them. Healthcare continues to be a growth sector for us, as the financial sector. We see a lot of opportunity over the next years in areas like energy, where we have a low market share, where energy companies are looking to save a lot of money as they transition their infrastructure, so the emerging sectors where we have a low market share that we see as good growth areas for us."

Geographically, I think we -- most of our CapEx is success-based. So it's driven by where the businesses is coming from. So you -- as you would expect, the vast majority of our capital goes into North America. But areas like Latin America, which are growing at faster growth rates, we tend to allocate capital at a higher percent of revenue. Areas like EMEA, where we are trying to reposition the business for growth, we're allocating capital at higher percent of revenues than their revenues compared to the overall '15. This year, there's a lot of comical being spent on integration. You heard Jeff talk about all the various platforms that we are consolidating. That effort will continue over the next couple of years in areas like order entry to provisioning to inventory over the next year or 2, some efforts in billing. And then in terms of product areas, we -- as we indicated earlier this year, we made a pretty significant investment to expand the capacity of our CDN network.

We have spent money in expanding our datacenter capabilities in Latin America. We have spent money in terms of doing network expansions in the U.S. We're still maintaining a base of adding 2,500 to 3,000 new buildings a year. I think this last quarter, we added about 700 buildings, our net buildings to the network, so that continues to be a focus for us. The other area we've spent money is in the security area. And as we look at next year, I think we see continued expansion in our security capability, including CDN. And then for the network expansions in Europe, where -- on Continental Europe as we look to expand our presence there. So these are some of the areas. And Jeff might have other things."

I'd just look at the list of things that I talked about earlier with respect to the market needs, and then how Level 3 wins and recognizes, that's how we spend our capital. Sunit mentioned added buildings. We want to get to our customers to provide our net services. Sunit mentioned expanding in markets whether it's in the U.S. expanding fiber footprint in the U.S. or in EMEA or in Latin America. It's about reaching our customers with our fiber infrastructure. I talked earlier about the Ethernet deployment that we had and integrating SDN into our capabilities so that we can make our services more accessible to our customers, easier to use, easier to implement within their infrastructures. 
Sunit talked about CDN and security. Those are the types of things we're investing in are the things that we see as fundamental needs for our customers, and we want to bring those capabilities through an on-net presence to them across the globe. So I think you touched on all of them pretty accurately."

And so do you feel like in all those growth areas you outlined or you're making investments, that you are making as full an investment in those areas as you think you need to? Because if that's the case, it would suggest that having extra liquidity going into next year opens up a lot of other things you could do. For example, maybe you could be a little bit more thoughtful around inorganic growth, or maybe just go right to buybacks.

That's a lot of money. We need to be good at it. I always think that we could be better at finding opportunities to invest that capital. I think we invested very well on the opportunities we see. I want us to get better at finding opportunities to invest the capital, both inorganically and organically. But organically first. How do we find more buildings to add? It's not our limitation in building -- adding buildings. This tends not to be our ability to execute. It tends to be our ability to find them and source them and really put them on the list. How do we find those opportunities to really invest? So we'll continue to try and get better at that, Brett. I mean, it's something that we think has to be a core competency, and we'll continue to look at, how do we find opportunities invest? 
With respect M&A, we're always going to be an inquisitive company. We've talked about that for a number of years. We're going to be opportunistic about it. We're also going to be disciplined, though. We don't feel that we have to go buy people for us to grow. So we'll be disciplined, making sure that there are good opportunities for -- if there are good opportunities for us to put plenty of use in use by inorganic means, then we will . We'll also make sure that any money we've spent in the past for example, tw telecom, that the for succeeded in integrating that to a point where anything else might not be a distraction. And so we're going to continue to try and find ways organically and inorganically to put money to work, and then Sunit talked about buybacks and our thoughts on those earlier. So we'll give you more guidance over coming quarters as those things firm up more."

We think the market going where we wanted to go, where we are good at serving them, and we'll continue to try and drive that. 
When it comes to Comcast. Michael, you just described the wholesale provider dilemma, and it's something that we're very good at. We enable our competitors each and every day. We sell services on a wholesale basis to many of the companies that you guys with this is our biggest competitors and WeList is our biggest competitors. 
So we're very good at that and, recognize that we can win in 2 ways. We can win by helping make Comcast more successful, by helping make somebody else more successful. But we can also win because we have capabilities that others don't have, and we can win directly with enterprise customers by providing those services that, in a way, that others don't or others can't. And so we're pretty pleased with our overall position that we have. And again, Comcast is an excellent company, but so are our other competitors."

With respect to M&A. In any particular region, we just look at the opportunities that are out there and respond to those opportunities. I've said it before, but you have to have a willing buyer and a willing seller, and so in some markets, there may be more willing sellers than were a willing buyer. In other markets, that may not be opportunity for us to buy something that we find compelling. So we're opportunistic. We stay in touch and engaged in all of the various regions across a range of things, not just fiber providers, but security, managed services, professional services. We pay attention to a range of different things, to see if there's something out there that make sense for us. But we are opportunistic, and we'll continue to be so. 
With that, thank you very much, James for the final question. I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. We delivered a solid quarter of growth in our enterprise business. While we have more to do, we've made good integration progress since the closing of the tw telecom acquisition a year ago. We continue to demonstrate our ability and our discipline to ramp free cash flow through our focus on profitable CNS revenue growth, synergy realization, other cost optimization initiatives and reducing interest expense, we remain firmly committed to increasing free cash flow on a per-share basis. 
At the same time, we're investing in the business for future revenue growth and to meet the demanding and evolving needs of enterprise customers. As always, thank you for joining in today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call."

I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter,",1660,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. Core Network Services revenue for the third quarter 2015 grew 5.5%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.5%. North America CNS enterprise revenue grew 8.3% year-over-year and 2.6% on a sequential basis. 
Excluding integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $675 million and was $657 million, including those expenses. The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million. At the end of the third quarter, we achieved $170 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. I'd also like to mention that earlier today, in our earnings release, we announced an accounting change in Latin America. In fact, in September 30, 2015, the company is deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries from future financial results. I'll give more detail regarding Venezuela in a moment. 
Additionally, based on our year-to-date performance, even with Venezuela excluded from our fourth quarter results and the higher integration expenses this quarter and currency headwinds in Brazil, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%, and continue to expect free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.5% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. As we have seen in previous quarters this year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 89% of CNS revenue as of the end of the third quarter, the British pound represented 5%, the euro 3% and the Brazilian real, 2%. All of the currencies are included in the remaining 1%. 
On a revenue-weighted average basis, the 3 largest currencies outside of the U.S. dollar declined 17% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth rate by approximately 2.8% this quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we saw the Brazilian real weakened 13% against the dollar compared to an average rates in the second quarter 2015. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 5.6%. From an enterprise perspective, we had a particularly strong third quarter with revenue growing 8.3% year-over-year and 2.7% on a sequential basis. We saw particular strength in professional services from the Federal segment that tends to be lumpy in nature. Also, CNS revenue declined 1.5% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. 
In EMEA, CNS revenue increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.5% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.3% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. The sequential performance this quarter was driven by increases in CDN, professional services revenue and dispute settlements. Also, the CNS revenue declined 5.7% on a constant currency basis and 14% on an as-reported basis in line with our expectations. 
U.K. government CNS revenue saw a slight increase of 0.4% on a constant currency basis and a decline of 7.1% on an as-reported basis. Despite this quarter's increase, we still expect double-digit percentage declines in U.K. government revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 9.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 9.0% on an as-reported basis. The sequential and year-over-year growth in Latin America this quarter was primarily due to increases in colocation and data center as well as IP and data revenue. Enterprise revenue grew 8.8% on a constant currency basis and declined 10% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue grew 10% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.9% on an as-reported basis. 
I'd like to take a moment to summarize the accounting changes we announced in this morning's earnings release. As we've been discussing for the past several quarters, the macroenvironment in Venezuela continues to worsen, and we believe significant uncertainty exists regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela. These evolving conditions have resulted in a lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and the inability to repatriate earnings from Venezuela back to the U.S. 
As a result, effective September 30, 2015, the company decided to deconsolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary from its consolidated financial statements. Going forward, Level 3's reported financial results will not include revenue adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from Venezuela. Additionally, as we noted in our press release earlier today, this deconsolidation resulted in a onetime charge of $171 million. We remain committed to our operations, employees and customers in Venezuela and will continue to provide communication services there. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue or WVS declined 19% to $116 million in the third quarter of 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. We have provided growth rates on both, on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services, which grew 9%, continue to drive the company's growth led by growth in VPN services and Internet access for enterprises. 
Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year but grew 5.9% on a sequential basis. transport and fiber grew 3.8% and within that group, dark fiber grew 6.4%. Colocation and datacenter services grew 2.1%, and voice services grew 0.6%. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. Each quarter, we analyze pricing dynamics and take a market-based approach to pricing our solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals and other factors. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access Costs was $706 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $717 million on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. Network Access margin expanded to 65.8% compared to 64.8% on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter 2015, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses, network-related expenses were $356 million. This compared to $365 million on a pro forma basis for the third quarter of 2014. 
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses for the third quarter 2015 was $325 million. This compares to $336 million for the third quarter of 2014. We also saw utility costs increased sequentially this quarter in the mid-single digit millions of dollars, lower than usual given the relatively cooler summer. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $657 million for the third quarter 2015. Excluding $18 million of integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $675 million. This compares to $670 million for the second quarter 2015 or $665 million, including $5 million in integration costs and compares to $620 million for the third quarter 2014 or $612 million, including $8 million in transaction and integration costs that quarter. 
The integration-related expenses this quarter of $18 million split into $8 million are network expenses and $10 million of SG&A. Integration related expenses this quarter were higher compared to the $5 million per quarter in the first half of the year due to an increase in headcount-related integration expenses. We expect that integration-related expenses in the fourth quarter will return to a run rate similar to what we saw in the first half this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses improved to 31.9% compared to 30.0% for the third quarter 2014. Excluding integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.7% compared to 30.4% for the third quarter of 2014. 
Moving to synergies. At the end of the third quarter, we have achieved $170 million of run rate savings. We are running ahead of schedule in terms of reaching our 18-month target of $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016. We remain confident in hitting our overall synergy target of $200 million. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $328 million in the third quarter 2015 and are 15% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. 
The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million in the quarter compared to $139 million from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $691 million, which benefited from our free cash flow during the quarter and was negatively impacted by $83 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.0x. This compares to 4.1x at both the end of last quarter and from the year-ago quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x. Additionally, during the quarter, Level 3's corporate credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to BA3 from B2. Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch radar corporate credit at BB-. 
We are confident in our full year financial performance despite the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations and continued currency headwinds. We have updated our outlook and now expect 215 (sic) [2015] adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%. We continue to expect to generate $600 million to $650 million of free cash flow for the full year 2015. All other outlook measures remain unchanged. 
In summary, while we still have work ahead of us on integration, we made a fair amount of progress. From a financial perspective, we are seeing steady performance in the business and remain focused on delivering profitable growth. With that, I look forward to providing everyone an update on our full year results in February. I will now turn the call over to Jeff."

As you heard from Sunit's remarks, we saw a good performance in all of our regions this quarter. While our results are rarely linear and frequently lumpy from 1 quarter to the next, we continue to drive profitable growth and are successful in converting that growth into strong free cash flow. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're a few days away from the 1-year anniversary of the tw telecom acquisition. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration. 
Before I get into the integration details, though, I'd like to announce that John Blount, our North America regional President, will be retiring at the end of 2015. I'd like to personally thank John for all of his contributions. Early on in the acquisition process, John and I both saw the fundamental role he could take and the importance of his leadership during the integration. Even prior to closing, John spent 6 months or so leading the integration planning from the tw telecom side. Over the last year, John has been a tremendous asset in guiding our North America business and many of our integration efforts. John is committed to a 6-month consulting agreement, so I feel very fortunate that I'll have the benefit of his advice and perspectives well into 2016. 
From an integration perspective. While we have more work to do, we've made significant progress across numerous fronts. During the last year, we've combined 2 large sales organizations, realigned around a common general manager structure, implemented a uniform go-to-market strategy, established a global account management team to serve our largest customers globally, standardized sales compensation and deployed a single CRM platform meanwhile, maintaining voluntary sales attrition well within our expectations and continuing to grow sales production each quarter. 
We defined and deployed a global purpose-built Ethernet platform. It's not a hodgepodge deployment of new and old technologies that form the foundation of many Ethernet networks. This is a fully architected SDN-enabled platform, designed to deliver Ethernet services and a differentiated customer experience to our enterprise and wholesale customers. 
We've merged the spirit [ph] IP, MPLS and voice networks across the company, reducing complexity and costs and increasing flexibility going forward. We combined our service insurance and travel ticketing systems in North America and are working on a consistent global environment. 
We completed the integration of our global ERP systems into a single platform worldwide and are well on our way to consolidating the former tw telecom billing system and to the go-forward Level 3 billing environment. And lastly, we are pleased with the synergy realization that all of these initiatives have made possible. Again, while integration is not complete, we are well on our way and are pleased with the progress we've made. 
With respect to the replacement for John, 80% of our revenues in North America and almost all of our integration activities are focused here. As you might imagine, I already spend a significant amount of time focused on the region. John's leadership team is excellent with broad experience and focused on delivering for our customers. As a result of these 2 factors, I do not intend to appoint an interim lead. Until we replace John, I will continue to spend my time ensuring we are driving our growth and executing our integration plan within the region. 
We do have a number of excellent internal candidates, and we'll look externally as well but will not be in a rush to fill the position. 
I'll move on now to a question many of you asked me from time to time. You ask, why does Level 3 win? There are really 2 parts to the answer. The first is about the market. The need for the services and capabilities Level 3 provides is strong and growing. The second is about Level 3 itself. Our ability to effectively meet those customer needs is also strong and growing. 
You've heard me talk about technology transitions accelerating and how the move to a digital world affects every aspect of our work and lives. As a result, the operating environment for CIOs is becoming more and more complex. The demand for ever-increasing capacity and bandwidth has not slowed. Just a few years ago, explosives bandwidth demand was limited to a few industries, like social media, financial services and health care. Today, you'd be hard-pressed to find an industry that does not require scalable, reliable bandwidth to meet their needs for growth. Until a few years ago, CIOs controlled the applications of an enterprise, the hardware those applications ran on and the devices we use to connect with them. 
Today, the applications may be homegrown or cloud-based. Even homegrown applications are likely to run somewhere in the cloud over virtualized computing resources, and we all bring our own devices to the workplaces. 
Meanwhile, security threats continue to escalate. DDoS attacks had more than doubled over the last 12 months and system intrusions and data exfiltration have become almost a commonplace. Security is a critical focus for our customers and they recognize the need for securing their services in multiple ways within the enterprise, at the interface between the enterprise and the network provider and within the core of the network itself. While the environment is more complex, CIOs are also being asked to improve overall performance of their systems and reduce expenses at the same time. 
So that's the environment, but why do we win? Level 3 is invested in our products and our capabilities to take advantage of these dynamic environment and continually improve our execution and the customer experience we provide. First of all, we are 100% focused on the wireline needs of enterprise customers. We're not distracted by wireless, by consumers or by pay television. We do serve wholesale customers, but even then, we're really targeting the needs of enterprises that those wholesale providers serve. Wireline enterprise network isn't a piece of our business. It isn't an add-on to our business. It is our business. 
Level 3's expertise and experience in deploying and managing large-scale, complex global IP and optical networks is not easy to come by and allows us to provide a differentiated experience for our customers. We're not mired in technologies of the past, rather we continually look at where customers needs are going and now -- how our technology should evolve. 
We have a product portfolio available globally that's designed to create comprehensive solutions for customers. Whether dark fiber, Ethernet transport, public IP, CDN or a host of voice services, we're able to implement a wide range of network solutions to meet an enterprise's global needs. 
We're not standing still leader. We're heavily investing in integrating SDN and the virtualization of network functionality into our product portfolio and our operating environment, preparing Level 3 for the next wave of dramatic network evolution. 
Our operating model and our go-to-market strategy are aimed at providing an excellent customer experience with regional and local management focused on where customers buying decisions are made. 
From a security perspective, we have the situational awareness and the ability to implement security capabilities at the edge and in the core of the network to assist and securing enterprises digital environment. The bottom line is we have an integrated and comprehensive approach to addressing our customers network challenges and the fiber-based network to meet those needs around the world. 
Sunit has already covered our results for the quarter so I won't spend time repeating, but I'll add a couple of comments. Looking at North America, enterprise CNS revenue continues to be the key. This quarter, we grew at 2.6% sequentially or 8.3% year-over-year. In EMEA, I believe we're making progress. We have an excellent team in place, and excluding the U.K. government, we are stabilizing the business. The team has done a good job of extending the life of several of the U.K. government contracts, but as Sunit mentioned, we continue to expect double-digit declines. 
Moving to Latin America. I'd like to comment on the accounting change related to Venezuela. Let me reiterate that we remain committed to the market, particularly to our employees and customers in the country. I'd like to thank our employees in Venezuela for their ongoing commitment to providing excellent service to our customers in a very difficult environment. 
For the region as a whole, the macroenvironment continues to be challenging. As I noted last quarter, the demand for our services remains strong and we still see opportunity to grow the business to meet our customers needs across the region, as we saw from our results in the quarter. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to commend the SEC for their action earlier this month to investigate incumbent special access tariffs. Level 3 strongly supports a competitive marketplace, and we believe the elimination of these demand lock-up agreements will create a more competitive industry and fuel investment and innovation. 
Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, will you explain the process?"

Maybe talk a little bit about where you're seeing the benefits coming in faster and how we think about the timing of how that hits EBITDA. It seems like maybe it's a little bit more fourth-quarter-weighted. And then second question on North America enterprise. Jeff, we appreciate you weighing out the why Level 3 wins. And I guess, as we start to head into year-end and look into 2016, and growth looks to be shaping up around 8% in North America enterprise, do you think the market, as we head into 2016, could support the same type of growth, or maybe even something faster going forward?"

I think the network expense side has been running at or a little slower than the pace we'd like, but we've been running quite a bit of ahead, and I think a lot of that, as Jeff pointed out, has to do with a lot of the platforms we put in place already, which allows us to cut a lot of work internally and to be -- to drive that. 
In this quarter in particular, as I said, the synergies came more from the headcount-related side expenses so we had some reductions in various areas as we have integrated the platforms. And I think as we look out -- yes, we're certainly running ahead of the $140 million we said. We had hit at the end of the first quarter next year, and I think that we're certainly running quite a bit closer to the ultimate $200 million target that we had set for ourselves. I would say ahead of schedule at this point."

Secondly, I believe in everything that I said about the market and where the market is going and what the needs of the markets are. And I believe everything I said about our ability to satisfy those needs. And if you look historically, we've been able to satisfy those needs better than our competitors. So I believe in our position, our competitive position in the market, and our ability to continue to satisfy customers and grow the business. Now it's always up to us to execute, and we have to continue to execute, but I do not see factors in the market that would prevent us from continuing to drive outperformance and from us, continuing to grow in the market.

First, with respect to the SEC, and I won't quantify what it means for us, but I'll talk about the environment that it creates. Today, many of the incumbents have what we considered demand lock-up agreements. It prevents customers from going to somebody else because they lose discounts in all of their services if they -- a little bit of their services with some other provider. That constrains stray. That constraints the ability of customers to move their traffic to Level 3. So if we eliminate those demand lock-up agreements, and the FCC is investigating them, and they're asking the appropriate questions about them, if they were to decide to eliminate those demand lock-up agreements, then there's a lot of opportunity for us that today, is not really addressable. Even though companies want to move services to us, even though we can provide a better solution for them, they don't have the ability to move because they lose their discounts on their embedded base of services if they do. So we think it's a very positive event. We look forward to the SEC making final rulings, and we'll be very actively participating in their process to provide them with our insight and our input in the process. 
With respect to Comcast, Comcast is a very good company. They're an excellent customer of Level 3. They're a vendor to Level 3. They're a partner of Level 3. So they're a very good company. They've done a very good job at the small end of business customers that we don't take them lightly and don't discount them in any way whatsoever. However, Level 3 already operates in a very competitive environment and its competitive environment globally for capabilities that delivered around the world, not just in North America, not just in EMEA, but around the world, our customers need our services and capability. 
We are very good at competing with companies that have been doing this for 100 years, companies that have major shares of the market, and we've been -- we've exceeded their performance if you look at ours versus theirs over the past few years. And so we're very comfortable about our competitive position and about the products and services that we sell to those customers. And so this feels like -- we have competitors come and go in the market, and this feels like more of the same. We'll continue to focus on our execution on our products and services into delivering a customer experience that no one can match over a network that no one can match."

Our datacenter strategy is tightly coupled with our regional strategy. If you look in Latin America, datacenter is an integral part of the way customers buy our other services, our transport services, our -- the various long-haul capabilities and other metro services. It's integral to the way that they want to buy. 
In North America, it's not as integral. Customers want to buy datacenter separately. They don't care if it's connected. It may be separate, they don't care of its connected to transport or long-haul are any of those other services. 
EMEA is a little bit in between the 2. So our strategy varies a little bit based on the market that we're talking about and how we're cooperating. But in general, we're pleased with our data center portfolio. It tends to be a little more telco-based than the high-end data centers with all the newest capabilities. So we tend to be a little bit lower than those really high-end datacenters. But when our customers need those types of services, we're very good at partnering with other companies to make sure that we have datacenter space that's appropriate for our customers. As a good example, there's a datacenter in Omaha that's a world-class datacenter. We were one of the anchor tenants in there. So that we took down space so that when our customers have a need for that, we can easily put them in there, and then we can grow and expand our capabilities to match the needs that we have in the marketplace. 
I want us to be better, frankly, in datacenter revenues. I think we can do better in selling the services and growing the business. But overall, we're pleased with our portfolio and have an answer for getting into the really high-end datacenters that may be building ourselves doesn't make sense."

I mean, until the end of the quarter, you don't know what ends up being the case until you finish the quarter. So I think what we're seeing is some of the particular strength in the third quarter came from the areas that I mentioned. I won't comment specifically on whether you back that out into fourth quarter, but obviously, you saw particular strength. We were above the sort of goal of 2% sequential growth or 8% year-on-year in enterprise. And then, I think on your question on free cash flow and EBITDA guidance, I see a lot of things happening. Clearly, you saw the -- most of the EBITDA in Venezuela does translate to the cash flow line because there wasn't that much in capital spending there. And so that was a negative. We obviously had higher cash integration expenses here in the third quarter. So I think as we added up everything together, we still think the free cash flow range we had continues to be the right range, which is why we reaffirm that. And then as it pertains to our cash flow and returning capital, I'll make a few comments, and Jeff can add onto that. But I think in general, we -- Level 3 is a growth company. We focus on growth and we get pretty high operating and investment leverage from the existing networks we have. We get very high returns so we prefer to do that. Beyond that, as you've seen, we participate historically in a table of consolidation and acquisition that continues to be a good use of money to deploy large amounts of capital at pretty attractive returns. If we're not as successful in putting everything -- all our money to work there, certainly, buybacks make a lot of sense. Or if your share prices do not value our growth prospects properly, returning capital to shareholders through buybacks certainly make a lot of sense, and that would be our preference versus dividends, for example. So at least that's our current thinking. Having said that, as Jeff has mentioned in the past, as we have undergone this cash flow transformation, this is a subject that we would have more to speak about -- talk about in the next few quarters."

We want to come up with solutions that meet their needs. And so that sales approach continues to be the same.

From a product perspective, I would say that the biggest thing driving us is enterprise's need for IP and data. And as enterprises move to more hybrid networks, it's both in IP VPN networks, Internet access or enterprises good growth areas for us, security and CDN, our emerging services, but we see good growth from that especially CDN. Sequentially, we think that will continue. As I said earlier, professional service is lumpy, but in general, that's a good category for us as people transition to more cloud-based solutions. 
The story is little different by region, as Jeff pointed out, for example 4 datacenters in Latin America. From an industry vertical perspective, I think the biggest growth driver continues to be from the technology and media software sector. So some of the big West Coast companies are driving a fair bit of growth, and then also some of the big media companies as they move to virtualize their platforms and have them in the cloud. Some of you, for example, might have noticed things like the NFL game in London over the weekend carried over  the Internet, which is plus. So those sorts of things, generally, we are a beneficiary of. 
More recently, we've seen also good growth from the manufacturing sector, the automotive sector being one of them. Healthcare continues to be a growth sector for us, as does the financial sector. We see a lot of opportunity over the next years in areas like energy, where we have a low market share, where energy companies are looking to save a lot of money as they transition their infrastructure, so the emerging sectors where we have a low market share that we see as good growth areas for us."

I'll start off, and Jeff might have other things he wants to add. But I think in terms of ongoing maintenance capital, roughly 15% of revenues, it's about $1.2 billion plus of CapEx on an annual basis. And I would say that maintenance CapEx is probably about $300 million to $350 million in that range, which includes upgrading some of the basic infrastructure, whether it's replacing our factory plants certain back of the factory plants and locations, that sort of thing. Geographically, I think we -- most of our CapEx is success-based. So it's driven by where the businesses is coming from. So you -- as you would expect, the vast majority of our capital goes into North America. But areas like Latin America, which are growing at faster growth rates, we tend to allocate capital at a higher percent of revenue. Areas like EMEA, where we are trying to reposition the business for growth, we're allocating capital at higher percent of revenues than their revenues compared to the overall '15. This year, there's a lot of capital being spent on integration. You heard Jeff talk about all the various platforms that we are consolidating. That effort will continue over the next couple of years in areas like order entry to provisioning to inventory over the next year or 2, some efforts in billing. And then in terms of product areas, we -- as we indicated earlier this year, we made a pretty significant investment to expand the capacity of our CDN network. That was $50 million over the last year, so we invested about $35-plus million to build a branch off of our subsea network in Latin America into Colombia with the lending station. We have spent money in expanding our datacenter capabilities in Latin America. We have spent money in terms of doing network expansions in the U.S. We're still maintaining a pace of adding 2,500 to 3,000 new buildings a year. I think this last quarter, we added about 700 buildings, our net buildings to the network, so that continues to be a focus for us. The other area we've spent money is in the security area. And as we look at next year, I think we see continued expansion in our security capability, including CDN. And then for the network expansions in Europe, where -- on Continental Europe as we look to expand our presence there. So these are some of the areas. And Jeff might have other things."

And so interconnection is not behind us. Do we see benefits? We see disadvantages to consumers and to the marketplace when companies refuse to interconnect. And so customers that want content to download win, companies refuse to interconnect with Level 3, their customers suffer. And so as we go out and we talk to our peers in the industry and those other parties, that's what we focus on.

And so that's really how we focus on interconnection. We'll continue to focus, and there are a few standouts that we will continue to work on to get better interconnection with them. 
With respect to M&A. In any particular region, we just look at the opportunities that are out there and respond to those opportunities. I've said it before, but you have to have a willing buyer and a willing seller, and so in some markets, there may be more willing sellers than were a willing buyer. In other markets, that may not be opportunity for us to buy something that we find compelling. So we're opportunistic. We stay in touch and engaged in all of the various regions across a range of things, not just fiber providers, but security, managed services, professional services. We pay attention to a range of different things, to see if there's something out there that make sense for us. But we are opportunistic, and we'll continue to be so. 
With that, thank you very much, James for the final question. I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. We delivered a solid quarter of growth in our enterprise business. While we have more to do, we've made good integration progress since the closing of the tw telecom acquisition a year ago. We continue to demonstrate our ability and our discipline to ramp free cash flow through our focus on profitable CNS revenue growth, synergy realization, other cost optimization initiatives and reducing interest expense, we remain firmly committed to increasing free cash flow on a per-share basis. 
At the same time, we're investing in the business for future revenue growth and to meet the demanding and evolving needs of enterprise customers. As always, thank you for joining in today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call."

I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter,",1660,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say we delivered a solid quarter of financial performance and continue to make progress from an integration and synergy perspective. I'd like to start with some of the highlights for the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3 of our presentation. Core Network Services revenue for the third quarter 2015 grew 5.5%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.5%. North America CNS enterprise revenue grew 8.3% year-over-year and 2.6% on a sequential basis. 
Excluding integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA grew to $675 million and was $657 million, including those expenses. The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million. At the end of the third quarter, we achieved $170 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. I'd also like to mention that earlier today, in our earnings release, we announced an accounting change in Latin America. In fact, in September 30, 2015, the company is deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries from future financial results. I'll give more detail regarding Venezuela in a moment. 
Additionally, based on our year-to-date performance, even with Venezuela excluded from our fourth quarter results and the higher integration expenses this quarter and currency headwinds in Brazil, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%, and continue to expect free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million. 
Turning to Slide 4. CNS revenue grew 5.5% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. As we have seen in previous quarters this year, the difference in constant currency and as-reported growth rates can be attributed to the strength of the dollar compared to the year-ago period. Outside of the U.S. dollar, which represented 89% of CNS revenue as of the end of the third quarter, the British pound represented 5%, the euro 3% and the Brazilian real, 2%. All of the currencies are included in the remaining 1%. 
On a revenue-weighted average basis, the 3 largest currencies outside of the U.S. dollar declined 17% against the dollar compared to the year-ago quarter and negatively affected our CNS revenue growth rate by approximately 2.8% this quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we saw the Brazilian real weakened 13% against the dollar compared to an average rates in the second quarter 2015. 
On a regional basis, North America CNS revenue grew 5.6%. From an enterprise perspective, we had a particularly strong third quarter with revenue growing 8.3% year-over-year and 2.7% on a sequential basis. We saw particular strength in professional services from the Federal segment that tends to be lumpy in nature. Also, CNS revenue declined 1.5% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. 
In EMEA, CNS revenue increased 2.2% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.5% on an as-reported basis. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 8.3% on a constant currency basis and 2.6% on an as-reported basis. The sequential performance this quarter was driven by increases in CDN, professional services revenue and dispute settlements. Also, the CNS revenue declined 5.7% on a constant currency basis and 14% on an as-reported basis in line with our expectations. 
U.K. government CNS revenue saw a slight increase of 0.4% on a constant currency basis and a decline of 7.1% on an as-reported basis. Despite this quarter's increase, we still expect double-digit percentage declines in U.K. government revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 9.1% on a constant currency basis and declined 9.0% on an as-reported basis. The sequential and year-over-year growth in Latin America this quarter was primarily due to increases in colocation and data center as well as IP and data revenue. Enterprise revenue grew 8.8% on a constant currency basis and declined 10% on an as-reported basis. Wholesale CNS revenue grew 10% on a constant currency basis and declined 4.9% on an as-reported basis. 
I'd like to take a moment to summarize the accounting changes we announced in this morning's earnings release. As we've been discussing for the past several quarters, the macroenvironment in Venezuela continues to worsen, and we believe significant uncertainty exists regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela. These evolving conditions have resulted in a lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and the inability to repatriate earnings from Venezuela back to the U.S. 
As a result, effective September 30, 2015, the company decided to deconsolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary from its consolidated financial statements. Going forward, Level 3's reported financial results will not include revenue adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from Venezuela. Additionally, as we noted in our press release earlier today, this deconsolidation resulted in a onetime charge of $171 million. We remain committed to our operations, employees and customers in Venezuela and will continue to provide communication services there. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Wholesale Voice Services and other revenue or WVS declined 19% to $116 million in the third quarter of 2015. We expect continued double-digit rates of decline in WVS revenue. 
Turning to Slide 6 and revenue results by product group. We have provided growth rates on both, on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. My remarks reference the growth rates on a constant currency basis. IP and data services, which grew 9%, continue to drive the company's growth led by growth in VPN services and Internet access for enterprises. 
Within IP and data services, CDN declined year-over-year but grew 5.9% on a sequential basis. transport and fiber grew 3.8% and within that group, dark fiber grew 6.4%. Colocation and datacenter services grew 2.1%, and voice services grew 0.6%. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to see little change in the overall pricing environment. Each quarter, we analyze pricing dynamics and take a market-based approach to pricing our solutions looking at particular geographies, products, verticals and other factors. 
Turning to Slide 7. Network Access Costs was $706 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $717 million on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. Network Access margin expanded to 65.8% compared to 64.8% on a pro forma basis in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter 2015, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses, network-related expenses were $356 million. This compared to $365 million on a pro forma basis for the third quarter of 2014. 
SG&A, excluding noncash compensation expense and integration-related expenses for the third quarter 2015 was $325 million. This compares to $336 million for the third quarter of 2014. We also saw utility costs increased sequentially this quarter in the mid-single digit millions of dollars, lower than usual given the relatively cooler summer. 
Turning to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA, including integration-related expenses, was $657 million for the third quarter 2015. Excluding $18 million of integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $675 million. This compares to $670 million for the second quarter 2015 or $665 million, including $5 million in integration costs and compares to $620 million for the third quarter 2014 or $612 million, including $8 million in transaction and integration costs that quarter. 
The integration-related expenses this quarter of $18 million split into $8 million are network expenses and $10 million of SG&A. Integration related expenses this quarter were higher compared to the $5 million per quarter in the first half of the year due to an increase in headcount-related integration expenses. We expect that integration-related expenses in the fourth quarter will return to a run rate similar to what we saw in the first half this year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin, including integration-related expenses improved to 31.9% compared to 30.0% for the third quarter 2014. Excluding integration-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.7% compared to 30.4% for the third quarter of 2014. 
Moving to synergies. At the end of the third quarter, we have achieved $170 million of run rate savings. We are running ahead of schedule in terms of reaching our 18-month target of $140 million by the end of the first quarter 2016. We remain confident in hitting our overall synergy target of $200 million. 
On Slide 9, capital expenditures were $328 million in the third quarter 2015 and are 15% of total revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect CapEx of 15% of total revenue for the full year 2015. 
The company generated strong free cash flow of $247 million in the quarter compared to $139 million from the year-ago quarter. As of September 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $691 million, which benefited from our free cash flow during the quarter and was negatively impacted by $83 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
Turning to Slide 10. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.0x. This compares to 4.1x at both the end of last quarter and from the year-ago quarter. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 5x. Additionally, during the quarter, Level 3's corporate credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to BA3 from B2. Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch radar corporate credit at BB-. 
We are confident in our full year financial performance despite the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations and continued currency headwinds. We have updated our outlook and now expect 215 (sic) [2015] adjusted EBITDA growth of 15% to 17% compared to our previous outlook of 14% to 17%. We continue to expect to generate $600 million to $650 million of free cash flow for the full year 2015. All other outlook measures remain unchanged. 
In summary, while we still have work ahead of us on integration, we made a fair amount of progress. From a financial perspective, we are seeing steady performance in the business and remain focused on delivering profitable growth. With that, I look forward to providing everyone an update on our full year results in February. I will now turn the call over to Jeff."

As you heard from Sunit's remarks, we saw a good performance in all of our regions this quarter. While our results are rarely linear and frequently lumpy from 1 quarter to the next, we continue to drive profitable growth and are successful in converting that growth into strong free cash flow. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're a few days away from the 1-year anniversary of the tw telecom acquisition. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration. 
Before I get into the integration details, though, I'd like to announce that John Blount, our North America regional President, will be retiring at the end of 2015. I'd like to personally thank John for all of his contributions. Early on in the acquisition process, John and I both saw the fundamental role he could take and the importance of his leadership during the integration. Even prior to closing, John spent 6 months or so leading the integration planning from the tw telecom side. Over the last year, John has been a tremendous asset in guiding our North America business and many of our integration efforts. John is committed to a 6-month consulting agreement, so I feel very fortunate that I'll have the benefit of his advice and perspectives well into 2016. 
From an integration perspective. While we have more work to do, we've made significant progress across numerous fronts. During the last year, we've combined 2 large sales organizations, realigned around a common general manager structure, implemented a uniform go-to-market strategy, established a global account management team to serve our largest customers globally, standardized sales compensation and deployed a single CRM platform meanwhile, maintaining voluntary sales attrition well within our expectations and continuing to grow sales production each quarter. 
We defined and deployed a global purpose-built Ethernet platform. It's not a hodgepodge deployment of new and old technologies that form the foundation of many Ethernet networks. This is a fully architected SDN-enabled platform, designed to deliver Ethernet services and a differentiated customer experience to our enterprise and wholesale customers. 
We've merged the spirit [ph] IP, MPLS and voice networks across the company, reducing complexity and costs and increasing flexibility going forward. We combined our service insurance and travel ticketing systems in North America and are working on a consistent global environment. 
We completed the integration of our global ERP systems into a single platform worldwide and are well on our way to consolidating the former tw telecom billing system and to the go-forward Level 3 billing environment. And lastly, we are pleased with the synergy realization that all of these initiatives have made possible. Again, while integration is not complete, we are well on our way and are pleased with the progress we've made. 
With respect to the replacement for John, 80% of our revenues in North America and almost all of our integration activities are focused here. As you might imagine, I already spend a significant amount of time focused on the region. John's leadership team is excellent with broad experience and focused on delivering for our customers. As a result of these 2 factors, I do not intend to appoint an interim lead. Until we replace John, I will continue to spend my time ensuring we are driving our growth and executing our integration plan within the region. 
We do have a number of excellent internal candidates, and we'll look externally as well but will not be in a rush to fill the position. 
I'll move on now to a question many of you asked me from time to time. You ask, why does Level 3 win? There are really 2 parts to the answer. The first is about the market. The need for the services and capabilities Level 3 provides is strong and growing. The second is about Level 3 itself. Our ability to effectively meet those customer needs is also strong and growing. 
You've heard me talk about technology transitions accelerating and how the move to a digital world affects every aspect of our work and lives. As a result, the operating environment for CIOs is becoming more and more complex. The demand for ever-increasing capacity and bandwidth has not slowed. Just a few years ago, explosives bandwidth demand was limited to a few industries, like social media, financial services and health care. Today, you'd be hard-pressed to find an industry that does not require scalable, reliable bandwidth to meet their needs for growth. Until a few years ago, CIOs controlled the applications of an enterprise, the hardware those applications ran on and the devices we use to connect with them. 
Today, the applications may be homegrown or cloud-based. Even homegrown applications are likely to run somewhere in the cloud over virtualized computing resources, and we all bring our own devices to the workplaces. 
Meanwhile, security threats continue to escalate. DDoS attacks had more than doubled over the last 12 months and system intrusions and data exfiltration have become almost a commonplace. Security is a critical focus for our customers and they recognize the need for securing their services in multiple ways within the enterprise, at the interface between the enterprise and the network provider and within the core of the network itself. While the environment is more complex, CIOs are also being asked to improve overall performance of their systems and reduce expenses at the same time. 
So that's the environment, but why do we win? Level 3 is invested in our products and our capabilities to take advantage of these dynamic environment and continually improve our execution and the customer experience we provide. First of all, we are 100% focused on the wireline needs of enterprise customers. We're not distracted by wireless, by consumers or by pay television. We do serve wholesale customers, but even then, we're really targeting the needs of enterprises that those wholesale providers serve. Wireline enterprise network isn't a piece of our business. It isn't an add-on to our business. It is our business. 
Level 3's expertise and experience in deploying and managing large-scale, complex global IP and optical networks is not easy to come by and allows us to provide a differentiated experience for our customers. We're not mired in technologies of the past, rather we continually look at where customers needs are going and now -- how our technology should evolve. 
We have a product portfolio available globally that's designed to create comprehensive solutions for customers. Whether dark fiber, Ethernet transport, public IP, CDN or a host of voice services, we're able to implement a wide range of network solutions to meet an enterprise's global needs. 
We're not standing still leader. We're heavily investing in integrating SDN and the virtualization of network functionality into our product portfolio and our operating environment, preparing Level 3 for the next wave of dramatic network evolution. 
Our operating model and our go-to-market strategy are aimed at providing an excellent customer experience with regional and local management focused on where customers buying decisions are made. 
From a security perspective, we have the situational awareness and the ability to implement security capabilities at the edge and in the core of the network to assist and securing enterprises digital environment. The bottom line is we have an integrated and comprehensive approach to addressing our customers network challenges and the fiber-based network to meet those needs around the world. 
Sunit has already covered our results for the quarter so I won't spend time repeating, but I'll add a couple of comments. Looking at North America, enterprise CNS revenue continues to be the key. This quarter, we grew at 2.6% sequentially or 8.3% year-over-year. In EMEA, I believe we're making progress. We have an excellent team in place, and excluding the U.K. government, we are stabilizing the business. The team has done a good job of extending the life of several of the U.K. government contracts, but as Sunit mentioned, we continue to expect double-digit declines. 
Moving to Latin America. I'd like to comment on the accounting change related to Venezuela. Let me reiterate that we remain committed to the market, particularly to our employees and customers in the country. I'd like to thank our employees in Venezuela for their ongoing commitment to providing excellent service to our customers in a very difficult environment. 
For the region as a whole, the macroenvironment continues to be challenging. As I noted last quarter, the demand for our services remains strong and we still see opportunity to grow the business to meet our customers needs across the region, as we saw from our results in the quarter. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to commend the SEC for their action earlier this month to investigate incumbent special access tariffs. Level 3 strongly supports a competitive marketplace, and we believe the elimination of these demand lock-up agreements will create a more competitive industry and fuel investment and innovation. 
Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, will you explain the process?"

I think the network expense side has been running at or a little slower than the pace we'd like, but we've been running quite a bit of ahead, and I think a lot of that, as Jeff pointed out, has to do with a lot of the platforms we put in place already, which allows us to cut a lot of work internally and to be -- to drive that. 
In this quarter in particular, as I said, the synergies came more from the headcount-related side expenses so we had some reductions in various areas as we have integrated the platforms. And I think as we look out -- yes, we're certainly running ahead of the $140 million we said. We had hit at the end of the first quarter next year, and I think that we're certainly running quite a bit closer to the ultimate $200 million target that we had set for ourselves. I would say ahead of schedule at this point."

First, with respect to the SEC, and I won't quantify what it means for us, but I'll talk about the environment that it creates. Today, many of the incumbents have what we considered demand lock-up agreements. It prevents customers from going to somebody else because they lose discounts in all of their services if they -- a little bit of their services with some other provider. That constrains stray. That constraints the ability of customers to move their traffic to Level 3. So if we eliminate those demand lock-up agreements, and the FCC is investigating them, and they're asking the appropriate questions about them, if they were to decide to eliminate those demand lock-up agreements, then there's a lot of opportunity for us that today, is not really addressable. Even though companies want to move services to us, even though we can provide a better solution for them, they don't have the ability to move because they lose their discounts on their embedded base of services if they do. So we think it's a very positive event. We look forward to the SEC making final rulings, and we'll be very actively participating in their process to provide them with our insight and our input in the process. 
With respect to Comcast, Comcast is a very good company. They're an excellent customer of Level 3. They're a vendor to Level 3. They're a partner of Level 3. So they're a very good company. They've done a very good job at the small end of business customers that we don't take them lightly and don't discount them in any way whatsoever. However, Level 3 already operates in a very competitive environment and its competitive environment globally for capabilities that delivered around the world, not just in North America, not just in EMEA, but around the world, our customers need our services and capability. 
We are very good at competing with companies that have been doing this for 100 years, companies that have major shares of the market, and we've been -- we've exceeded their performance if you look at ours versus theirs over the past few years. And so we're very comfortable about our competitive position and about the products and services that we sell to those customers. And so this feels like -- we have competitors come and go in the market, and this feels like more of the same.

Our datacenter strategy is tightly coupled with our regional strategy. If you look in Latin America, datacenter is an integral part of the way customers buy our other services, our transport services, our -- the various long-haul capabilities and other metro services. It's integral to the way that they want to buy. 
In North America, it's not as integral. Customers want to buy datacenter separately. They don't care if it's connected. It may be separate, they don't care of its connected to transport or long-haul are any of those other services. 
EMEA is a little bit in between the 2. So our strategy varies a little bit based on the market that we're talking about and how we're cooperating. But in general, we're pleased with our data center portfolio. It tends to be a little more telco-based than the high-end data centers with all the newest capabilities. So we tend to be a little bit lower than those really high-end datacenters. But when our customers need those types of services, we're very good at partnering with other companies to make sure that we have datacenter space that's appropriate for our customers. As a good example, there's a datacenter in Omaha that's a world-class datacenter. We were one of the anchor tenants in there. So that we took down space so that when our customers have a need for that, we can easily put them in there, and then we can grow and expand our capabilities to match the needs that we have in the marketplace. 
I want us to be better, frankly, in datacenter revenues. I think we can do better in selling the services and growing the business. But overall, we're pleased with our portfolio and have an answer for getting into the really high-end datacenters that may be building ourselves doesn't make sense."

And if there isn't one in place or view now, when can we expect you to have a more formalized approach to that?

I mean, until the end of the quarter, you don't know what ends up being the case until you finish the quarter. So I think what we're seeing is some of the particular strength in the third quarter came from the areas that I mentioned. I won't comment specifically on whether you back that out into fourth quarter, but obviously, you saw particular strength. We were above the sort of goal of 2% sequential growth or 8% year-on-year in enterprise. And then, I think on your question on free cash flow and EBITDA guidance, I see a lot of things happening. Clearly, you saw the -- most of the EBITDA in Venezuela does translate to the cash flow line because there wasn't that much in capital spending there. And so that was a negative. We obviously had higher cash integration expenses here in the third quarter. So I think as we added up everything together, we still think the free cash flow range we had continues to be the right range, which is why we reaffirm that. And then as it pertains to our cash flow and returning capital, I'll make a few comments, and Jeff can add onto that. But I think in general, we -- Level 3 is a growth company. We focus on growth and we get pretty high operating and investment leverage from the existing networks we have. We get very high returns so we prefer to do that. Beyond that, as you've seen, we participate historically in a table of consolidation and acquisition that continues to be a good use of money to deploy large amounts of capital at pretty attractive returns. If we're not as successful in putting everything -- all our money to work there, certainly, buybacks make a lot of sense. Or if your share prices do not value our growth prospects properly, returning capital to shareholders through buybacks certainly make a lot of sense, and that would be our preference versus dividends, for example. So at least that's our current thinking. Having said that, as Jeff has mentioned in the past, as we have undergone this cash flow transformation, this is a subject that we would have more to speak about -- talk about in the next few quarters."

From a product perspective, I would say that the biggest thing driving us is enterprise's need for IP and data. And as enterprises move to more hybrid networks, it's both in IP VPN networks, Internet access or enterprises good growth areas for us, security and CDN, our emerging services, but we see good growth from that especially CDN. Sequentially, we think that will continue. As I said earlier, professional service is lumpy, but in general, that's a good category for us as people transition to more cloud-based solutions. 
The story is little different by region, as Jeff pointed out, for example 4 datacenters in Latin America. From an industry vertical perspective, I think the biggest growth driver continues to be from the technology and media software sector. So some of the big West Coast companies are driving a fair bit of growth, and then also some of the big media companies as they move to virtualize their platforms and have them in the cloud. Some of you, for example, might have noticed things like the NFL game in London over the weekend carried over  the Internet, which is plus. So those sorts of things, generally, we are a beneficiary of. 
More recently, we've seen also good growth from the manufacturing sector, the automotive sector being one of them. Healthcare continues to be a growth sector for us, as does the financial sector. We see a lot of opportunity over the next years in areas like energy, where we have a low market share, where energy companies are looking to save a lot of money as they transition their infrastructure, so the emerging sectors where we have a low market share that we see as good growth areas for us."

And then in terms of product areas, we -- as we indicated earlier this year, we made a pretty significant investment to expand the capacity of our CDN network. That was $50 million over the last year, so we invested about $35-plus million to build a branch off of our subsea network in Latin America into Colombia with the lending station. We have spent money in expanding our datacenter capabilities in Latin America. We have spent money in terms of doing network expansions in the U.S. We're still maintaining a pace of adding 2,500 to 3,000 new buildings a year. I think this last quarter, we added about 700 buildings, our net buildings to the network, so that continues to be a focus for us. The other area we've spent money is in the security area. And as we look at next year, I think we see continued expansion in our security capability, including CDN. And then for the network expansions in Europe, where -- on Continental Europe as we look to expand our presence there. So these are some of the areas. And Jeff might have other things."

Sunit mentioned added buildings. We want to get to our customers to provide our net services. Sunit mentioned expanding in markets whether it's in the U.S. expanding fiber footprint in the U.S. or in EMEA or in Latin America. It's about reaching our customers with our fiber infrastructure. I talked earlier about the Ethernet deployment that we had and integrating SDN into our capabilities so that we can make our services more accessible to our customers, easier to use, easier to implement within their infrastructures. 
Sunit talked about CDN and security. Those are the types of things we're investing in are the things that we see as fundamental needs for our customers, and we want to bring those capabilities through an on-net presence to them across the globe. So I think you touched on all of them pretty accurately."

And so do you feel like in all those growth areas that you outlined or you're making investments, that you are making as full an investment in those areas as you think you need to? Because if that's the case, it would suggest that having extra liquidity going into next year opens up a lot of other things you could do. For example, maybe you could be a little bit more thoughtful around inorganic growth, or maybe just go right to buybacks. And so I'd just be interested in hearing around if you're going to put more capital into the business, including potentially trying to make inorganic investments around areas where you see potential, how do you think about that over the next couple of years?"

That's a lot of money. We need to be good at it. I always think that we could be better at finding opportunities to invest that capital. I think we invest it very well on the opportunities we see. I want us to get better at finding opportunities to invest the capital, both organically and inorganically. But organically first. How do we find more buildings to add? It's not our limitation in building -- adding buildings tends not to be our ability to execute. It tends to be our ability to find them and source them and really put them on the list. How do we find those opportunities to really invest? So we'll continue to try and get better at that, Brett. I mean, it's something that we think has to be a core competency, and we'll continue to look at, how do we find opportunities to invest? 
With respect to M&A, we're always going to be an inquisitive company. We've talked about that for a number of years. We're going to be opportunistic about it. We're also going to be disciplined, though. We don't feel that we have to go buy people for us to grow. So we'll be disciplined, making sure that there are good opportunities for -- if there are good opportunities for us to put money to use in use by inorganic means, then we will . We'll also make sure that any money we've spent in the past for example, to buy tw telecom, that the for succeeded in integrating that to a point where anything else might not be a distraction. And so we're going to continue to try and find ways organically and inorganically to put money to work, and then Sunit talked about buybacks and our thoughts on those earlier. So we'll give you more guidance over coming quarters as those things firm up more."

And then second, a lot of talk about Comcast, others coming into the fortune 1000 space, historically, you have worked with Comcast in providing network infrastructure they might not have had themselves.

First of all, market share loss of our competitors, I think that speaks for itself. I mean, if you look at outperformance over the past few years, we've been growing revenue in -- with enterprise customers. Overall, we don't think enterprise spend is increasing. So if we're growing revenue, and spend is staying flat, let's say, then by definition, we're growing share. So we're very comfortable with our position there.We're very happy with the opportunity in front of us. We think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to help enterprises, make the transition from older traditional technologies to IP optical services and continue to drive growth. We're happy with our capabilities, and the position that we have in the market now are competitive position in the market, and it's -- we've said for a long time that our ability to grow is based in our ability to execute. We think the market is going where we wanted to go, where we are good at serving them, and we'll continue to try and drive that. 
When it comes to Comcast. Michael, you just described the wholesale provider dilemma, and it's something that we're very good at. We enable our competitors each and every day. We sell services on a wholesale basis to many of the companies that you guys would list as our biggest competitors and we list as our biggest competitors. 
So we're very good at that and, recognize that we can win in 2 ways. We can win by helping make Comcast more successful, by helping make somebody else more successful. But we can also win because we have capabilities that others don't have, and we can win directly with enterprise customers by providing those services that, in a way, that others don't or others can't. And so we're pretty pleased with our overall position that we have. And again, Comcast is an excellent company, but so are our other competitors."

With respect to M&A. In any particular region, we just look at the opportunities that are out there and respond to those opportunities. I've said it before, but you have to have a willing buyer and a willing seller, and so in some markets, there may be more willing sellers than were a willing buyer. In other markets, that may not be opportunity for us to buy something that we find compelling. So we're opportunistic. We stay in touch and engaged in all of the various regions across a range of things, not just fiber providers, but security, managed services, professional services. We pay attention to a range of different things, to see if there's something out there that make sense for us. But we are opportunistic, and we'll continue to be so. 
With that, thank you very much, James for the final question. I'd like to close the call with just a few thoughts. We delivered a solid quarter of growth in our enterprise business. While we have more to do, we've made good integration progress since the closing of the tw telecom acquisition a year ago. We continue to demonstrate our ability and our discipline to ramp free cash flow through our focus on profitable CNS revenue growth, synergy realization, other cost optimization initiatives and reducing interest expense, we remain firmly committed to increasing free cash flow on a per-share basis.
