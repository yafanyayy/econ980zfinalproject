278341,281882306,751045,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015. However, the strong quarter is ove",806,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015. However, the strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. When the oil markets -- with oil markets oversupplied, sluggish demand forecast, prices at 6-year lows and without confidence that we've reached the pricing floor, great uncertainty exist for our customers. If triple digit oil prices were unsustainably high, what isn't clear is how far the pendulum may now be swinging to price oil within sustainable levels on the low side. As a result, drilling activity and spot pricing has significantly declined in the U.S. Many industry analyst have predicted a 500 to 900 rig count reduction in U.S. land. And since the peak of activity at the end of October 2014, recent rig counts already appeared to be down by 300 to 500 rigs. This wide range depends on the rig count source and how inclusive it is of smaller rigs. So far, however, the burden of the rig count reductions appear to have been shouldered by our competitors legacy rig fleet. By using third-party rig counts, we estimate that approximately 58% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs, and that approximately 27% are SCR rigs. While AC drive rigs makeup approximately 15%. 
We expect the downturn may also reduce the number of planned newbuilds for 2015. The industry will most likely deliver 100 to 120 new AC drive rigs throughout the year with an expectation that all of these rigs would be sponsored with term contracts. This total would be a much lower number and cadence than originally estimated in 2014. 
Looking at past down cycles, the rig replacement cycle usually accelerates. This can be seen most recently during the peak and troughs since 2008 and 2009 in the U.S. land market. The legacy rig fleet made up of mechanical and SCR rigs reached a lower peak rig count in each successive cycle. As an example using third-party data, we estimate that that the peak count from mechanical rigs were approximately 1,000 rigs in 2008, approximately 800 rigs in 2012 and approximately 600 rigs in 2014. Today, we estimate that the mechanical rig count is below 400 rigs, actually lower than the SCR rig count for the first time. 
Historically, rig count reductions at this stage of the cycle tend to be indiscriminate. And this downturn is no different. Spot market rigs are the first to go, and even top performing AC drive rigs have been released. However, once the trough rig count is reached, rig quality, safety and performance are all evaluated to make decisions when putting rigs back to work. Customers have a choice and H&P's focus on strong field performance, where our people are determined to win the confidence of the customer every day and that provides us an important advantage. 
The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected. We reported earlier this month that the number of idle FlexRigs was increasing and spot market pricing was down approximately 10% and we expect an additional softness in the market going forward. The outlook for pricing and activity continue to be lower and we don't see the outlook improving during fiscal 2015. I heard someone say recently that the job of correcting markets when they're oversupplied is to find a price that destroys the oversupply. And in this case, the process that is required to destroy the oversupply is for E&P companies, including our customers, to sideline hundreds of drilling rigs in the U.S., including H&P rigs. 
Our field employee count is directly proportional to our rig count. Unfortunately, that means we have begun the process of making significant reductions to our workforce as we idle many of our rigs. Based on what we know today, it is possible that we would have approximately 2,000 or more field positions eliminated by the foreseeable rig reductions. This is, without question, the worst part of the downturn. Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best positioned drilling contractor. Fortunately, we still have 31 newbuilds to deliver, all sponsored with 3-year term contracts, a backlog of $4.6 billion to start the calendar year and term contract coverage of an average of approximately 160 rigs for the remainder of fiscal 2015. 
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, as I think about the outlook, our experience has taught us that in the face of a very negative market like we see today, and a growing perception in panic of weaker ever prices, the market does work and eventually, all fundamentals improve. 
Now Juan Pablo will give you more details on the first fiscal quarter and our outlook for the next quarter."
278341,281882306,751045,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling",1762,"Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling activity to significantly decline, the number of revenue days during the first fiscal quarter also represented a record level. 
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $295 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of early termination of long-term contracts. The number of revenue days increased by 2% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 297 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately 179 of these rigs were active under term contracts and approximately 118 rigs were active in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day increased by 1.6% to $28,603. And the average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,046. Resulting in an average rig margin per day of $15,557. 
During the quarter, we generated approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications, we may generate over $60 million during the second fiscal quarter from additional early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts. 
Since our last conference call in November, we have received termination notices for a total of approximately 22 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, 7 of which were estimated to have under 90 days of remaining contract duration and 7 of which have contract durations that extended beyond September 30, 2015, which is the end of our fiscal year. 
As of today, the 340 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 243 active rigs and 97 idle rigs. All except 1 of our active rigs are AC drive rigs. Of the 97 idle rigs, 73 are AC drive rigs and the remaining 24 idle rigs are SCR rigs. Included in the 243 rigs that are active today are 162 rigs under term contracts and 81 rigs in the spot market. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by roughly 25% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have less than 200 rigs active by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue to decline to levels between $27,000 and $27,500 per day. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,350 as we deal with some volatilities and significant changes in activity levels. Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, we have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 160 rigs during the second quarter, and an average of about 137 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to remain roughly flat during the first -- excuse me, during the fiscal year as some rigs roll off and newbuilds are deployed. 
The quarterly average pricing for rigs in the spot market slightly increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. But is expected to significantly decline during the second fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is over 10% lower as compared to pricing per rigs now working under term contracts, which of course, were negotiated over the last few years. 
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $21 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total quarterly days increased by about 10% and the average rig margin per day declined to $20,732. All 9 of the company's platform rigs were active by the end of the first quarter. 
As we look at the second quarter of 2015 -- of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to remain relatively flat, along with a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $19,500. Given current market conditions, and some expected platform-to-platform rig mobilizations, we would not be surprised to see activity levels and average daily margins decline during the rest of the fiscal year. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter including some favorable retroactive pricing adjustments was approximately $8 million. But this is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $12 million during the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased to $10,770. And quarterly revenue days remained flat at an equivalent of about 23 active rigs. As of today, our international land segment has 20 inactive rigs. Including 9 in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 each in Ecuador and Mozambique. 
14 rigs are idle including 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Tunisia, pardon me, and 1 in Bahrain. An additional 6 rigs already assigned to this segment are in various stages of transition from the U.S. to Argentina. 
For the second fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decline by about 10% to 15%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline about 25% to 30% as compared to the first fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. 
We received early termination notification for a rig with a long-term contract that is now idle, and expect approximately $8 million in early termination revenues from that contract. We also have ongoing discussions with a customer regarding the possibility of an additional rig contract early termination. 
The daily margin weakness in the segment is primarily due to several rigs in transition and others becoming idle. The first 4 rigs related to our 10 rig YPS project have commenced operations in Argentina. We now expect to see roughly 700 revenue days from this project during the third fiscal quarter. And to hopefully be at productivity during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
The project's daily margins, that is the projects daily rate margins and contribution, the bottom line are also expected to improve as this long-term project is fully deployed during the fiscal year and transitional expenses are behind us. 
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Given lower levels of expected activities during fiscal 2015, and a partial deferral of new FlexRig construction spending to fiscal 2016, we now estimate capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion during fiscal 2015. We are reducing the construction cadence to 2 FlexRigs per month beginning in June through the end of the calendar year, allowing us to have newbuild continuity as we go through this downturn, while at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog. 
Roughly 70% of the CapEx estimate for fiscal 2015 corresponds to our newbuild program, less than 20% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The portion corresponding to our 2015 newbuild program also includes most of the major components in dollar value required for the 6 FlexRigs under term contracts that are now scheduled to be completed during early fiscal 2016. 
Although we still expect to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 in excess of the $1.1 billion generated during fiscal 2014, we may need to externally fund a portion of our capital expenditures during the fiscal year. 
With a debt-to-cap ratio today of approximately 2%, our balance sheet is in great shape to enable the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during fiscal 2015, and the 6 additional ones now scheduled for fiscal 2016. We already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 160 rigs across our drilling segment during the last 3 quarters of fiscal 2015; an average of almost 130 rigs during fiscal 2016; and an average of approximately 100 rigs during fiscal 2017. About 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provides the company with a benefit of an average pricing level of that is expected to generate great margin per day averages that are higher than the $15,557 per day average corresponding to our most recent quarter. The term contract coverage just mentioned, excludes long-term contracts for, which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that the deserted terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments. 
Given changes in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2014, to approximately $4.6 billion as of December 30 2014. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter as we earn the corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract terminations. 
We still expect our total annual depreciation expense to be slightly over $600 million during fiscal 2015. And our general and administrative expenses to be slightly over $140 million. The recent tax law change in bonus depreciation allowances resulted in a first fiscal quarter 2015 adjustment given a reduction of our 2014 cash taxes. This also increased our deferred taxes by approximately $100 million. This accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for cash tax purposes will favorably impact the company's liquidity during this fiscal year. 
We expect the effective rate for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 to be between 35% and 36%. We repurchased approximately 810,000 shares during late November and early December of 2014 at slightly under $60 million. We did not repurchase additional shares after that time frame, given the significant change in market conditions. 
We have a 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2017, we're currently using, pardon me, we are currently only using it for letters of credit and have over $250 million available to borrow under that facility. 
As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. These holdings were recently valued at close to $150 million with an after-tax value of over $19 million. 
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

If you think about it in terms not necessarily of just raw rig releases but if you think about it in terms of percentage of rigs released in the basin that we're working, in rigs we have a small footprint, 11 or 12 rigs at California that's been hit pretty hard, where about 80% of the fleet has been released there. The Niobrara has had over 50%; Marcellus is around 50%, Woodbine, 60%; Bakken, is 40 -- a little over 40%. For us, I think, a positive is our distribution of rigs in basins like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Both of those basins are our largest. We obviously, have had several rigs released in each of those basis but to get your perspective, the Eagle Ford is down 25%, 28% something like that. And the Permian is over 30%. So while we have had rigs released in those basins, it seems like those tend to be a little stronger in terms of the economics going forward."

Again, it's a pretty wide range. But that's what the third-party rig services or rig count services best we can glean out of that. We still have a large percentage of that 57%, 58% are mechanical and 27% are SCR. So yes, we are impacted. I think again it's not anything you're in a position to brag about at all, but we're still in a situation where I think we're picking up a little incremental market share as this falling situation is going on. I do think, to answer your question, I have no idea what the outlook is in terms of when we reach bottom. Our oil prices, how we reach that level now, I don't think there's a great certainty in the market that, that we've got in there. But if we are, our experience is, is that when you get to that point where customers can put together budgets that they can count on and they can get a rig count forecast going forward, and think that's when we have an opportunity as customers begin to migrate their print anything that would be the opportunity that we'd be able to take advantage off."

So while again it's a good question. I think as I look at us in our overall fleet profile, one of the big advantages we have is this fleet continuity and uniformity and the size of the fleet and our ability to utilize standard process for driving better drilling performance, rig move performance, safety performance. And I think all of those are advantages that will serve us well as we -- in the future as we come out of this downturn and customers begin to look at expanding their fleets and migrating the rig fleets. It's hard to say what the legacy rig count will do over the next 3 to 6 months. But what we can seize are pretty clear trend as we go through the cycles."

Again, like I said we're in this 300 to 500 range now, and many expect it to be closer to 900. So with that in mind, I would say we're going to continue to see rigs in the spot market released and potentially again depending on the rig and if working for particular customer in some cases, rigs will roll off of term and then they'll roll into the spot market and they'll continue to work.

If that were to happen, then yes, we would see a reversal but the reversal would be very slight, I -- we have a $1.3 billion liability related to deferred income taxes, that would probably come down by maybe between $10 million and $30 million during 2016.

The bright light, of course, is related to the YPF project, where we have 10 FlexRigs under 5-year contracts each that are in the process of being deployed.

278341,281882306,751381,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo. And good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.However, the strong quarter is ov",804,"Thank you, Juan Pablo. And good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.
However, the strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. When the oil markets -- with oil markets oversupplied, sluggish demand forecast, prices at 6-year lows and without confidence that we've reached the pricing floor, great uncertainty exists for our customers. If triple-digit oil prices were unsustainably high, what isn't clear is how far the pendulum may now be swinging to price oil at unsustainable levels on the low side.
As a result, drilling activity and spot pricing has significantly declined in the U.S. Many industry analysts have predicted a 500- to 900-rig count reduction in U.S. land. And since the peak of activity at the end of October 2014, recent rig counts already appeared to be down by 300 to 500 rigs. This wide range depends on the rig count source and how inclusive it is of smaller rigs.
So far, however, the burden of the rig count reductions appear to have been shouldered by our competitors' legacy rig fleet. By using third-party rig counts, we estimate that approximately 58% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 27% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs makeup approximately 15%.
We expect the downturn may also reduce the number of planned new builds for 2015. The industry will most likely deliver 100 to 120 new AC drive rigs throughout the year with an expectation that all of these rigs would be sponsored with term contracts. This total would be a much lower number and cadence than originally estimated in 2014.
Looking at past downcycles, the rig replacement cycle usually accelerates. This can be seen most recently during the peak and troughs since 2008 and 2009 in the U.S. land market. The legacy rig fleet made up of mechanical and SCR rigs reached a lower-peak rig count in each successive cycle. As an example, using third-party data, we estimate that the peak count from mechanical rigs would approximately 1,000 rigs in 2008, approximately 800 rigs in 2012 and approximately 600 rigs in 2014. Today, we estimate that the mechanical rig count is below 400 rigs, actually lower than the SCR rig count for the first time.
Historically, rig count reductions at this stage of the cycle tend to be indiscriminate. And this downturn is no different. Spot market rigs are the first to go, and even top-performing AC drive rigs have been released. However, once the trough rig count is reached, rig quality, safety and performance are all evaluated to make decisions when putting rigs back to work. Customers have a choice. And H&P's focus on strong field performance, where our people are determined to win the confidence of the customer every day, and that provides us an important advantage.
The rig count reduction, thus far, has been more swift than many expected. We reported earlier this month that the number of idle FlexRigs was increasing, and spot market pricing was down approximately 10%. And we expect an additional softness in the market going forward. The outlook for pricing and activity continue to be lower, and we don't see the outlook improving during fiscal 2015.
I heard someone say recently, ""The job of correcting markets when they're oversupplied is to find a price that destroys the oversupply."" And in this case, the process that is required to destroy the oversupply is for E&P companies, including our customers, to side light -- side line hundreds of drilling rigs in the U.S., including H&P rigs.
Our field employee count is directly proportional to our rig count. Unfortunately, that means we have begun the process of making significant reductions to our workforce, as we idle many of our rigs. Based on what we know today, it is possible that we will have approximately 2,000 or more field positions eliminated by the foreseeable rig reductions. This is, without question, the worst part of the downturn.
Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best-positioned drilling contractor. Fortunately, we still have 31 new builds to deliver, all sponsored with 3-year term contracts, a backlog of $4.6 billion to start the calendar year and term contract coverage of an average of approximately 160 rigs for the remainder of fiscal 2015.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, as I think about the outlook, our experience has taught us that in the face of a very negative market like we see today and a growing perception in panic of weaker forever prices, the market does work, and eventually, all fundamentals improve.
Now Juan Pablo will give you more details on the first fiscal quarter and our outlook for the next quarter."
278341,281882306,751381,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drill",1771,"Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling activity to significantly decline, the number of revenue days during the first fiscal quarter also represented a record level.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $295 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of early termination of long-term contracts. The number of revenue days increased by 2% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 297 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately 179 of these rigs were active under term contracts, and approximately 118 rigs were active in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day increased by 1.6% to $28,603. And the average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,046, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $15,557.
During the quarter, we generated approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications, we may generate over $60 million during the second fiscal quarter from additional early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts.
Since our last conference call in November, we have received termination notices for a total of approximately 22 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, 7 of which were estimated to have under 90 days of remaining contract duration, and 7 of which have contract durations that extended beyond September 30, 2015, which is the end of our fiscal year.
As of today, the 340 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 243 active rigs and 97 idle rigs. All except 1 of our active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs. Of the 97 idle rigs, 73 are AC drive FlexRigs, and the remaining 24 idle rigs are SCR rigs. Included in the 243 rigs that are active today are 162 rigs under term contracts and 81 rigs in the spot market.
Looking ahead at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by roughly 25% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have less than 200 rigs active by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue to decline to levels between $27,000 and $27,500 per day. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,350 as we deal with some volatilities and significant changes in activity levels.
Subject to additional early terminations, and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, we have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 160 rigs during the second quarter at an average of about 137 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to remain roughly flat during the first -- excuse me, during the fiscal year as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed.
The quarterly average pricing for rigs in the spot market slightly increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 but is expected to significantly decline during the second fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is over 10% lower as compared to pricing per rigs now working under term contracts, which of course, were negotiated over the last few years.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $21 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total quarterly days increased by about 10%, and the average rig margin per day declined to $20,732. All 9 of the company's platform rigs were active by the end of the first quarter.
As we look at the second quarter of 2015 -- of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to remain relatively flat, along with a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $19,500. Given current market conditions and some expected platform-to-platform rig mobilizations, we would not be surprised to see activity levels and average daily margins decline during the rest of the fiscal year.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter including some favorable retroactive pricing adjustments was approximately $8 million. But this is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $12 million during the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased to $10,770. And quarterly revenue days remained flat at an equivalent of about 23 active rigs.
As of today, our international land segment has 20 active rigs including 9 in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 each in Ecuador and Mozambique. 14 rigs are idle including 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Tonisia -- Tunisia, pardon me, and 1 in Bahrain. An additional 6 rigs already assigned to this segment are in various stages of transition from the U.S. to Argentina.
For the second fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decline by about 10% to 15%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 25% to 30%, as compared to the first fiscal quarter excluding any impact from early contract terminations.
We received early termination notification for a rig with a long-term contract that is now idle and expect approximately $8 million in early termination revenues from that contract. We also have ongoing discussions with a customer regarding the possibility of an additional rig contract early termination.
The daily margin weakness in the segment is primarily due to several rigs in transition and others becoming idle. The first 4 rigs related to our 10-rig YPF project have commenced operations in Argentina. We now expect to see roughly 700 revenue days from this project during the third fiscal quarter and to hopefully be at full activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The project's daily margins, that is the project's daily rig margins and contribution to the bottom line are also expected to improve as this long-term project is fully deployed during the fiscal year and transitional expenses are behind us.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Given lower levels of expected activities during fiscal 2015 and a partial deferral of new FlexRig construction spending to fiscal 2016, we now estimate capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion during fiscal 2015. We are reducing the construction cadence to 2 FlexRigs per month beginning in June through the end of the calendar year, allowing us to have new build continuity as we go through this downturn, while at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog.
Roughly 70% of the CapEx estimate for fiscal 2015 corresponds to our new build program, less than 20% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The portion corresponding to our 2015 new build program also includes most of the major components in dollar value required for the 6 FlexRigs under term contracts that are now scheduled to be completed during early fiscal 2016.
Although we still expect to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 in excess of the $1.1 billion generated during fiscal 2014, we may need to externally fund a portion of our capital expenditures during the fiscal year.
With a debt-to-cap ratio today of approximately 2%, our balance sheet is in great shape to enable the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during fiscal 2015 and the 6 additional ones now scheduled for fiscal 2016, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 160 rigs across our drilling segment during the last 3 quarters of fiscal 2015; an average of almost 130 rigs during fiscal 2016; and an average of approximately 100 rigs during fiscal 2017.
About 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with a benefit of an average pricing level that is expected to generate great margin per day averages that are higher than the $15,557 per day average corresponding to our most recent quarter. The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments.
Given changes in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2014 to approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter as we earn the corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract terminations.
We still expect our total annual depreciation expense to be slightly over $600 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be slightly over $140 million.
The recent tax law change in bonus depreciation allowances resulted in a first fiscal quarter 2015 adjustment given a reduction of our 2014 cash taxes. This also increased our deferred taxes by approximately $100 million. This accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for cash tax purposes will favorably impact the company's liquidity during this fiscal year.
We expect the effective rate for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 to be between 35% and 36%. We repurchased approximately 810,000 shares during late November and early December of 2014 at slightly under $60 million. We did not repurchase additional shares after that time frame given the significant change in market conditions.
We have a 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2017. We're currently using -- pardon me, we are currently only using it for letters of credit and have over $250 million available to borrow under that facility.
As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. These holdings were recently valued at close to $150 million with an after-tax value of over $90 million.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And I'll close with a few comments regarding H&P's advantages and our outlook going forward, before opening the call to questions.
H&P has an experienced management team and seasoned field operations personnel that know how to manage through a downturn. The experience gained in the company's 95 years will continue to serve us well.
And speaking of long-term service, I would like to acknowledge Steve Mackey on this call, and he's nearly 30 years with the company. Steve is retiring soon from his role as EVP, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer at the company. Steve worked closely with Hans for over 25 years, and I've been fortunate to work with Steve since 2006. He has contributed in many ways to the success of H&P. Steve, thank you, for your many years of service, for your contributions, for your leadership, and every one at the company wishes you the best.
In addition to great people, we have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and access to capital. We have a large term contract backlog supported by a very strong customer base. Finally, we have the largest and most modern fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry. We believe our strategy has positioned the company to be competitive through the cycles. Whether we are faced with a downturn, like we are today, or in an improving market environment, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities ahead.
And now we will open the call for questions."

It's similar to what we talked about earlier this month. I would say the areas that we've seen most of the weakness. If you think about it in terms -- not necessarily of just raw rig releases, but if you think about it in terms of percentage of rigs released in the basin that we're working in, we've -- the rigs, we have a small footprint, 11 or 12 rigs at California. That's been hit pretty hard, where about 80% of the fleet has been released there. The Niobrara has had over 50%; Marcellus is around 50%; Woodbine, 60%; Bakken, is 40% -- a little over 40%. For us, I think, a positive is our distribution of rigs in basins like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Both of those basins are our largest. We obviously have had several rigs released in each of those basins. But to give perspective, the Eagle Ford is down 25%, 28% something like that; and the Permian is over 30%. So while we have had rigs released in those basins, it seems like those tend to be a little stronger in terms of the economics going forward."

Again, it's a pretty wide range. But that's what the third-party rig services -- or rig count services best we can glean out of that. You still have a large percentage of that: 57%, 58% are mechanical; and 27% are SCR. So yes, we are impacted. I think, and again, it's not anything you're in a position to brag about at all. But I mean, we're still in a situation where I think we're picking up a little incremental market share as the -- as this falling nice situation is going on. I do think, to answer your question, I have no idea what the outlook is in terms of when we reach bottom. Our oil prices, how we reach that level now. I don't think there's a great certainty in the market that, that we've got in there. But if we are, that -- our experience is, is that when you get to that point where customers can put together budgets that they can count on, and they can get a rig count forecast going forward, then I think that's when we have an opportunity as customers begin to high grade their fleet. I think that would be the opportunity that we would then be able to take advantage of."

And if you compare the rig -- those particular rigs and the day rates that they were able to command through the cycles and most recently in the -- the most recent peak, the spot market pricing that those rigs achieved, it was very similar; not the same as what we had on rigs in the spot market that have rolled off of their term contracts that may have only been 3 or 5 years old. So while I -- again, it's a good question. I think as I look at us in our overall fleet profile, one of the big advantages we have is this fleet continuity and uniformity and the size of the fleet and our ability to utilize standard processes for driving better drilling performance, rig move performance, safety performance. And I think all of those are advantages that will serve us well as we -- in the future as we come out of this downturn, and customers begin to look at expanding their fleets and high grading their rig fleets. It's hard to say what the legacy rig count will do over the next 3 to 6 months. But what we can seize is a pretty clear trend as we go through these cycles."

Again, at this stage of the market, it's hard to determine what level of rig activity we're ultimately going to go to. Like I said, we're in this 300 to 500 range now, and many expect it to be closer to 900. So with that in mind, I would say we're going to continue to see rigs in the spot market released. And potentially -- again, depending on the rig and if working for particular customer, in some cases, rigs will roll off of term, and then they'll roll into the spot market, and they'll continue to work.

I think what your question might imply, which is I think fair is, let's assume that in 2016, CapEx levels are much lower, perhaps closer to maintenance CapEx as compared to fiscal 2015. If that were to happen, then yes, we would see a reversal. But the reversal would be very slight. I -- we have a $1.3 billion liability related to deferred income taxes. That would probably come down by maybe between $10 million and $30 million during 2016. And then in 2017, it might be another amount that might be a little larger than that, if CapEx continues to be very low year.

But -- so it's going to be a balancing act. We're pleased with the level of margins that we expect from our contracted rigs including those in Argentina. We have other contracts in other countries. It really is a combination of several things. But it's tough to see activity start to decline in general, and also margins become softer.

278341,281882306,751854,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.However, the strong quarter is ov",801,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.
However, the strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. When the oil markets -- with oil markets oversupplied, sluggish demand forecasts, prices at 6-year lows and without confidence that we've reached a pricing floor, great uncertainty exists for our customers. If triple-digit oil prices were unsustainably high, what isn't clear is how far the pendulum may now be swinging to price oil at unsustainable levels on the low side.
As a result, drilling activity and spot pricing has significantly declined in the U.S. Many industry analysts have predicted a 500- to 900-rig count reduction in U.S. land. And since the peak of activity at the end of October 2014, recent rig counts already appear to be down by 300 to 500 rigs. This wide range depends on the rig count source and how inclusive it is of smaller rigs.
So far, however, the burden of the rig count reductions appear to have been shouldered by our competitors' legacy rig fleet. By using third-party rig counts, we estimate that approximately 58% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 27% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs make up approximately 15%.
We expect the downturn may also reduce the number of planned new builds for 2015. The industry will most likely deliver 100 to 120 new AC drive rigs throughout the year with an expectation that all of these rigs would be sponsored with term contracts. This total would be a much lower number and cadence than originally estimated in 2014.
Looking at past downcycles, the rig replacement cycle usually accelerates. This can be seen most recently during the peak and troughs since 2008 and 2009 in the U.S. land market. The legacy rig fleet, made up of mechanical and SCR rigs, reached a lower peak rig count in each successive cycle. As an example, using third-party data, we estimate that the peak count for mechanical rigs was approximately 1,000 rigs in 2008, approximately 800 rigs in 2012 and approximately 600 rigs in 2014. Today, we estimate that the mechanical rig count is below 400 rigs, actually lower than the SCR rig count for the first time.
Historically, rig count reductions at this stage of the cycle tend to be indiscriminate. And this downturn is no different. Spot market rigs are the first to go, and even top-performing AC drive rigs have been released. However, once the trough rig count is reached, rig quality, safety and performance are all evaluated to make decisions when putting rigs back to work. Customers have a choice. And H&P is focused on strong field performance, where our people are determined to win the confidence of the customer every day, and that provides us an important advantage.
The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected. We reported earlier this month that the number of idle FlexRigs was increasing and spot market pricing was down approximately 10%, and we expected additional softness in the market going forward. The outlook for pricing and activity continue to be lower, and we don't see the outlook improving during fiscal 2015.
I heard someone say recently, ""The job of correcting markets when they're oversupplied is to find a price that destroys the oversupply."" And in this case, the process that is required to destroy the oversupply is for E&P companies, including our customers, to sideline hundreds of drilling rigs in the U.S., including H&P rigs.
Our field employee count is directly proportional to our rig count. Unfortunately, that means we have begun the process of making significant reductions to our workforce as we idle many of our rigs. Based on what we know today, it is possible that we will have approximately 2,000 or more field positions eliminated by the foreseeable rig reductions. This is, without question, the worst part of the downturn.
Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best-positioned drilling contractor. Fortunately, we still have 31 new builds to deliver, all sponsored with 3-year term contracts, a backlog of $4.6 billion to start the calendar year and term contract coverage of an average of approximately 160 rigs for the remainder of fiscal 2015.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, as I think about the outlook, our experience has taught us that in the face of a very negative market like we see today and a growing perception and panic of weaker-forever prices, the market does work, and eventually all fundamentals improve.
Now Juan Pablo will give you more details on the first fiscal quarter and our outlook for the next quarter."
278341,281882306,751854,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drill",1767,"Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling activity to significantly decline, the number of revenue days during the first fiscal quarter also represented a record level.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $295 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of early termination of long-term contracts. The number of revenue days increased by 2% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 297 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately 179 of these rigs were active under term contracts, and approximately 118 rigs were active in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day increased by 1.6% to $28,603. And the average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,046, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $15,557.
During the quarter, we generated approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications, we may generate over $60 million during the second fiscal quarter from additional early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts.
Since our last conference call in November, we have received termination notices for a total of approximately 22 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, 7 of which were estimated to have under 90 days of remaining contract duration and 7 of which have contract durations that extend beyond September 30, 2015, which is the end of our fiscal year.
As of today, the 340 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 243 active rigs and 97 idle rigs. All except 1 of our active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs. Of the 97 idle rigs, 73 are AC drive FlexRigs, and the remaining 24 idle rigs are SCR rigs. Included in the 243 rigs that are active today are 162 rigs under term contracts and 81 rigs in the spot market.
Looking ahead at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by roughly 25% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have less than 200 rigs active by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early-terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue to decline to levels between $27,000 and $27,500 per day. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,350 as we deal with some volatilities and significant changes in activity levels.
Subject to additional early terminations, and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, we have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 160 rigs during the second quarter and an average of about 137 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to remain roughly flat during the first -- excuse me, during the fiscal year as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed.
The quarterly average pricing for rigs in the spot market slightly increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 but is expected to significantly decline during the second fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is over 10% lower as compared to pricing for rigs now working under term contracts which, of course, were negotiated over the last few years.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $21 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total quarterly days increased by about 10%, and the average rig margin per day declined to $20,732. All 9 of the company's platform rigs were active by the end of the first quarter.
As we look at the second quarter of 2015 -- of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to remain relatively flat, along with a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $19,500. Given current market conditions and some expected platform-to-platform rig mobilizations, we would not be surprised to see activity levels and average daily margins decline during the rest of the fiscal year.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter, including some favorable retroactive pricing adjustments, was approximately $8 million. But this is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $12 million during the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased to $10,770. And quarterly revenue days remained flat at an equivalent of about 23 active rigs.
As of today, our international land segment has 20 active rigs, including 9 in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 each in Ecuador and Mozambique. 14 rigs are idle, including 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Tonisia -- Tunisia, pardon me, and 1 in Bahrain. An additional 6 rigs already assigned to this segment are in various stages of transition from the U.S. to Argentina.
For the second fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decline by about 10% to 15%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 25% to 30% as compared to the first fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations.
We received early termination notification for a rig with a long-term contract that is now idle and expect approximately $8 million in early termination revenues from that contract. We also have ongoing discussions with a customer regarding the possibility of an additional rig contract early termination.
The daily margin weakness in this segment is primarily due to several rigs in transition and others becoming idle. The first 4 rigs related to our 10-rig YPF project have commenced operations in Argentina. We now expect to see roughly 700 revenue days from this project during the third fiscal quarter and to hopefully be at full activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The project's daily margins, that is the project's daily rig margins and contribution to the bottom line, are also expected to improve as this long-term project is fully deployed during the fiscal year and transitional expenses are behind us.
Let me now comment on corporate-level details. Given lower levels of expected activity during fiscal 2015 and a partial deferral of new FlexRig construction spending to fiscal 2016, we now estimate capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion during fiscal 2015. We are reducing the construction cadence to 2 FlexRigs per month beginning in June, through the end of the calendar year, allowing us to have new build continuity as we go through this downturn while, at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog.
Roughly 70% of the CapEx estimate for fiscal 2015 corresponds to our new build program, less than 20% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The portion corresponding to our 2015 new build program also includes most of the major components in dollar value required for the 6 FlexRigs under term contracts that are now scheduled to be completed during early fiscal 2016.
Although we still expect to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 in excess of the $1.1 billion generated during fiscal 2014, we may need to externally fund a portion of our capital expenditures during the fiscal year.
With a debt-to-cap ratio today of approximately 2%, our balance sheet is in great shape to enable the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during fiscal 2015 and the 6 additional ones now scheduled for fiscal 2016, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 160 rigs across our drilling segment during the last 3 quarters of fiscal 2015, an average of almost 130 rigs during fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 100 rigs during fiscal 2017.
About 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with the benefit of an average pricing level that is expected to generate great margin per day averages that are higher than the $15,557-per-day average corresponding to our most recent quarter. The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable, as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments.
Given changes in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2014, to approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter, as we earned a corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract terminations.
We still expect our total annual depreciation expense to be slightly over $600 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be slightly over $140 million.
The recent tax law change in bonus depreciation allowances resulted in a first fiscal quarter 2015 adjustment, given a reduction of our 2014 cash taxes. This also increased our deferred taxes by approximately $100 million. This accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for cash tax purposes will favorably impact the company's liquidity during this fiscal year.
We expect the effective rate for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 to be between 35% and 36%. We repurchased approximately 810,000 shares during late November and early December of 2014 at slightly under $60 million. We did not repurchase additional shares after that time frame, given the significant change in market conditions.
We have a 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2017. We're currently using -- pardon me, we are currently only using it for letters of credit and have over $250 million available to borrow under that facility.
As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. These holdings were recently valued at close to $150 million with an after-tax value of over $90 million.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And speaking of long-term service, I would like to acknowledge Steve Mackey on this call and his nearly 30 years with the company. Steve is retiring soon from his role as EVP, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer at the company. Steve worked closely with Hans for over 25 years, and I've been fortunate to work with Steve since 2006. He has contributed in many ways to the success of H&P. Steve, thank you for your many years of service, for your contributions, for your leadership, and every one at the company wishes you the best.
In addition to great people, we have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and access to capital. We have a large term contract backlog supported by a very strong customer base. Finally, we have the largest and most modern fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry. We believe our strategy has positioned the company to be competitive through the cycles. Whether we are faced with a downturn, like we are today, or in an improving market environment, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities ahead.
And now we will open the call for questions."

I'll give a little bit of an overview. It's similar to what we talked about earlier this month. I would say the areas that we've seen most of the weakness, if you think about it in terms not necessarily of just raw rig releases, but if you think about it in terms of percentage of rigs released in the basin that we're working in, we've -- the rigs, we have a small footprint, 11 or 12 rigs, out in California. That's been hit pretty hard, where about 80% of the fleet has been released there. The Niobrara has had over 50%; Marcellus is around 50%; Woodbine, 60%; Bakken is 40% -- a little over 40%. So the -- for us, I think, a positive is our distribution of rigs in basins like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Both of those basins are our largest. Now we obviously have had several rigs released in each of those basins. But to give perspective, the Eagle Ford is down 25%, 28%, something like that; and the Permian is over 30%. So while we have had rigs released in those basins, it seems like those tend to be a little stronger in terms of the economics going forward."

You still have a large percentage of that, 57%, 58%, are mechanical, and 27% are SCR. So yes, we are impacted. I think -- and again, it's not anything you're in a position to brag about at all. But I mean, we're still in a situation where I think we're picking up a little incremental market share as the -- as this falling-knife situation is going on. So I do think, to answer your question, I have no idea what the outlook is in terms of when we reach bottom. Are oil prices -- have we reached that level now? I don't think there's a great certainty in the market that we've gotten there. But if we are, our experience is, is that when you get to that point where customers can put together budgets that they can count on and they can get a rig count forecast going forward, then I think that's when we have an opportunity as customers begin to high-grade their fleets. I think that would be the opportunity that we would then be able to take advantage of."

So while I -- again, it's a good question. I think, as I look at us and our overall fleet profile, one of the big advantages we have is this fleet continuity and uniformity and the size of the fleet and our ability to utilize standard processes for driving better drilling performance, rig move performance, safety performance.

That would probably come down by maybe between $10 million and $30 million during 2016. And then in 2017, it might be another amount that might be a little larger than that if CapEx continues to be very low. But if CapEx increases at some point, then we would once again probably start to defer additional income taxes. Did I address your question, Scott?"

We've had a few rigs become idle, some of those in Ecuador, Bahrain. We've seen Argentina also decline in terms of activity. The bright light, of course, is related to the YPF project, where we have 10 FlexRigs under 5-year contracts each that are in the process of being deployed. And so that will improve activity levels or at least, hopefully, more than offset any other declines that are market-driven from other countries and even from Argentina rigs that may become idle, given market conditions. But -- so it's going to be a balancing act. We're pleased with the level of margins that we expect from our contracted rigs, including those in Argentina. We have other contracts in other countries. It really is a combination of several things. But it's tough to see activity start to decline in general and also margins become softer. As I mentioned, what we do expect after the transition that we see that is ongoing, that is rigs becoming idle, rigs moving to Argentina, country to country, et cetera, we hope to see some improvement in daily margins by the end of the year. But again, it'll depend on market conditions in a significant way."

278341,281882306,752035,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.However, the strong quarter is ov",805,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.
However, the strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. When the oil markets -- with oil markets oversupplied, sluggish demand forecasts, prices at 6-year lows and without confidence that we've reached a pricing floor, great uncertainty exists for our customers. If triple-digit oil prices were unsustainably high, what isn't clear is how far the pendulum may now be swinging to price oil at unsustainable levels on the low side.
As a result, drilling activity and spot pricing has significantly declined in the U.S. Many industry analysts have predicted a 500- to 900-rig count reduction in U.S. land. And since the peak of activity at the end of October 2014, recent rig counts already appear to be down by 300 to 500 rigs. This wide range depends on the rig count source and how inclusive it is of smaller rigs.
So far, however, the burden of the rig count reductions appear to have been shouldered by our competitors' legacy rig fleet. By using third-party rig counts, we estimate that approximately 58% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 27% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs make up approximately 15%.
We expect the downturn may also reduce the number of planned new builds for 2015. The industry will most likely deliver 100 to 120 new AC drive rigs throughout the year with an expectation that all of these rigs would be sponsored with term contracts. This total would be a much lower number and cadence than originally estimated in 2014.
Looking at past downcycles, the rig replacement cycle usually accelerates. This can be seen most recently during the peak and troughs since 2008 and 2009 in the U.S. land market. The legacy rig fleet, made up of mechanical and SCR rigs, reached a lower peak rig count in each successive cycle. As an example, using third-party data, we estimate that the peak count for mechanical rigs was approximately 1,000 rigs in 2008, approximately 800 rigs in 2012 and approximately 600 rigs in 2014. Today, we estimate that the mechanical rig count is below 400 rigs, actually lower than the SCR rig count for the first time.
Historically, rig count reductions at this stage of the cycle tend to be indiscriminate. And this downturn is no different. Spot market rigs are the first to go, and even top performing AC drive rigs have been released. However, once the trough rig count is reached, rig quality, safety and performance are all evaluated to make decisions when putting rigs back to work. Customers have a choice. And H&P is focused on strong field performance, where our people are determined to win the confidence of the customer every day, and that provides us an important advantage.
The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected. We reported earlier this month that the number of idle FlexRigs was increasing and spot market pricing was down approximately 10%, and we expected additional softness in the market going forward. The outlook for pricing and activity continue to be lower, and we don't see the outlook improving during fiscal 2015.
I heard someone say recently, ""The job of correcting markets when they're oversupplied is to find a price that destroys the oversupply."" And in this case, the process that is required to destroy the oversupply is for E&P companies including our customers, to side light -- sideline hundreds of drilling rigs in the U.S. including H&P rigs.
Our field employee count is directly proportional to our rig count. Unfortunately, that means we have begun the process of making significant reductions to our workforce as we idle many of our rigs. Based on what we know today, it is possible that we will have approximately 2,000 or more field positions eliminated by the foreseeable rig reductions. This is, without question, the worst part of the downturn.
Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best-positioned drilling contractor. Fortunately, we still have 31 new builds to deliver, all sponsored with 3-year term contracts, a backlog of $4.6 billion to start the calendar year and term contract coverage of an average of approximately 160 rigs for the remainder of fiscal 2015.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, as I think about the outlook, our experience has taught us that in the face of a very negative market like we see today and a growing perception and panic of weaker-forever prices, the market does work, and eventually all fundamentals improve.
Now Juan Pablo will give you more details on the first fiscal quarter and our outlook for the next quarter."

The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drill",1769,"Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling activity to significantly decline, the number of revenue days during the first fiscal quarter also represented a record level.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $295 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of early termination of long-term contracts. The number of revenue days increased by 2% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 297 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately 179 of these rigs were active under term contracts, and approximately 118 rigs were active in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day increased by 1.6% to $28,603. And the average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,046, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $15,557.
During the quarter, we generated approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications, we may generate over $60 million during the second fiscal quarter from additional early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts.
Since our last conference call in November, we have received termination notices for a total of approximately 22 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, 7 of which were estimated to have under 90 days of remaining contract duration and 7 of which have contract durations that extend beyond September 30, 2015, which is the end of our fiscal year.
As of today, the 340 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 243 active rigs and 97 idle rigs. All except 1 of our active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs. Of the 97 idle rigs, 73 are AC drive FlexRigs, and the remaining 24 idle rigs are SCR rigs. Included in the 243 rigs that are active today are 162 rigs under term contracts and 81 rigs in the spot market.
Looking ahead at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by roughly 25% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have less than 200 rigs active by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early-terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue to decline to levels between $27,000 and $27,500 per day. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,350 as we deal with some volatilities and significant changes in activity levels.
Subject to additional early terminations, and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, we have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 160 rigs during the second quarter and an average of about 137 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to remain roughly flat during the first -- excuse me, during the fiscal year as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed.
The quarterly average pricing for rigs in the spot market slightly increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 but is expected to significantly decline during the second fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is over 10% lower as compared to pricing for rigs now working under term contracts which, of course, were negotiated over the last few years.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $21 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total quarterly days increased by about 10%, and the average rig margin per day declined to $20,732. All 9 of the company's platform rigs were active by the end of the first quarter.
As we look at the second quarter of 2015 -- of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to remain relatively flat, along with a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $19,500. Given current market conditions and some expected platform-to-platform rig mobilizations, we would not be surprised to see activity levels and average daily margins decline during the rest of the fiscal year.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter including some favorable retroactive pricing adjustments was approximately $8 million. But this is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $12 million during the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased to $10,770. And quarterly revenue days remained flat at an equivalent of about 23 active rigs.
As of today, our international land segment has 20 active rigs including 9 in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 each in Ecuador and Mozambique. 14 rigs are idle including 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Tonisia -- Tunisia, pardon me, and 1 in Bahrain. An additional 6 rigs already assigned to this segment are in various stages of transition from the U.S. to Argentina.
For the second fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decline by about 10% to 15%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 25% to 30% as compared to the first fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations.
We received early termination notification for a rig with a long-term contract that is now idle and expect approximately $8 million in early termination revenues from that contract. We also have ongoing discussions with a customer regarding the possibility of an additional rig contract early termination.
The daily margin weakness in this segment is primarily due to several rigs in transition and others becoming idle. The first 4 rigs related to our 10-rig YPF project have commenced operations in Argentina. We now expect to see roughly 700 revenue days from this project during the third fiscal quarter and to hopefully be at full activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The project's daily margins, that is the project's daily rig margins and contribution to the bottom line, are also expected to improve as this long-term project is fully deployed during the fiscal year and transitional expenses are behind us.
Let me now comment on corporate-level details. Given lower levels of expected activity during fiscal 2015 and a partial deferral of new FlexRig construction spending to fiscal 2016, we now estimate capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion during fiscal 2015. We are reducing the construction cadence to 2 FlexRigs per month beginning in June, through the end of the calendar year, allowing us to have new build continuity as we go through this downturn while, at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog.
Roughly 70% of the CapEx estimate for fiscal 2015 corresponds to our new build program, less than 20% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The portion corresponding to our 2015 new build program also includes most of the major components in dollar value required for the 6 FlexRigs under term contracts that are now scheduled to be completed during early fiscal 2016.
Although we still expect to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 in excess of the $1.1 billion generated during fiscal 2014, we may need to externally fund a portion of our capital expenditures during the fiscal year.
With a debt-to-cap ratio today of approximately 2%, our balance sheet is in great shape to enable the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during fiscal 2015 and the 6 additional ones now scheduled for fiscal 2016, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 160 rigs across our drilling segment during the last 3 quarters of fiscal 2015, an average of almost 130 rigs during fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 100 rigs during fiscal 2017.
About 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with the benefit of an average pricing level that is expected to generate great margin per day averages that are higher than the $15,557 per day average corresponding to our most recent quarter. The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable, as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments.
Given changes in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2014, to approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter, as we earned a corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract terminations.
We still expect our total annual depreciation expense to be slightly over $600 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be slightly over $140 million.
The recent tax law change in bonus depreciation allowances resulted in a first fiscal quarter 2015 adjustment given a reduction of our 2014 cash taxes. This also increased our deferred taxes by approximately $100 million. This accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for cash tax purposes will favorably impact the company's liquidity during this fiscal year.
We expect the effective rate for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 to be between 35% and 36%. We repurchased approximately 810,000 shares during late November and early December of 2014 at slightly under $60 million. We did not repurchase additional shares after that time frame given the significant change in market conditions.
We have a 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2017. We're currently using -- pardon me, we are currently only using it for letters of credit and have over $250 million available to borrow under that facility.
As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. These holdings were recently valued at close to $150 million with an after-tax value of over $90 million.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

That's been hit pretty hard, where about 80% of the fleet has been released there. The Niobrara has had over 50%; Marcellus is around 50%; Woodbine, 60%; Bakken is 40% -- a little over 40%. So the -- for us, I think, a positive is our distribution of rigs in basins like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Both of those basins are our largest. Now we obviously have had several rigs released in each of those basins. But to give perspective, the Eagle Ford is down 25%, 28%, something like that; and the Permian is over 30%. So while we have had rigs released in those basins, it seems like those tend to be a little stronger in terms of the economics going forward."

So while I -- again, it's a good question. I think, as I look at us and our overall fleet profile, one of the big advantages we have is this fleet continuity and uniformity and the size of the fleet and our ability to utilize standard processes for driving better drilling performance, rig move performance, safety performance. And I think all of those are advantages that will serve us well as we -- in the future as we come out of this downturn and customers begin to look at expanding their fleets and high grading their rig fleets.

So let me go ahead and try to clarify that, if I may. For what we've seen so far since our last conference call, since the steep downturn here, we've seen a total of 22 early terminations in the U.S. And we've already reported for the first fiscal quarter that we have approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to that. In the second fiscal quarter, of course, we'll have to determine, but we estimate that the early termination revenues would be over $60 million, so the $23 million plus the $60-plus million corresponding to those 22 early terminations. Now let me go back to 2008, 2009. In 2009, I believe that we had between 35 and 40 rigs early-terminated in the U.S. during that entire year. And the corresponding revenue from that -- and the number that I'll give you, it does include fiscal 2010, I believe, but it was over $200 million. I think it was close to $210 million."

278341,281882306,753222,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.However, the strong quarter is ov",803,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.
However, the strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. When the oil markets -- with oil markets oversupplied, sluggish demand forecasts, prices at 6-year lows and without confidence that we've reached a pricing floor, great uncertainty exists for our customers. If triple-digit oil prices were unsustainably high, what isn't clear is how far the pendulum may now be swinging to price oil at unsustainable levels on the low side.
As a result, drilling activity and spot pricing has significantly declined in the U.S. Many industry analysts have predicted a 500- to 900-rig count reduction in U.S. land. And since the peak of activity at the end of October 2014, recent rig counts already appear to be down by 300 to 500 rigs. This wide range depends on the rig count source and how inclusive it is of smaller rigs.
So far, however, the burden of the rig count reductions appear to have been shouldered by our competitors' legacy rig fleet. By using third-party rig counts, we estimate that approximately 58% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 27% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs make up approximately 15%.
We expect the downturn may also reduce the number of planned new builds for 2015. The industry will most likely deliver 100 to 120 new AC drive rigs throughout the year with an expectation that all of these rigs would be sponsored with term contracts. This total would be a much lower number and cadence than originally estimated in 2014.
Looking at past downcycles, the rig replacement cycle usually accelerates. This can be seen most recently during the peak and troughs since 2008 and 2009 in the U.S. land market. The legacy rig fleet, made up of mechanical and SCR rigs, reached a lower-peak rig count in each successive cycle. As an example, using third-party data, we estimate that the peak count for mechanical rigs was approximately 1,000 rigs in 2008, approximately 800 rigs in 2012 and approximately 600 rigs in 2014. Today, we estimate that the mechanical rig count is below 400 rigs, actually lower than the SCR rig count for the first time.
Historically, rig count reductions at this stage of the cycle tend to be indiscriminate. And this downturn is no different. Spot market rigs are the first to go, and even top-performing AC drive rigs have been released. However, once the trough rig count is reached, rig quality, safety and performance are all evaluated to make decisions when putting rigs back to work. Customers have a choice. And H&P is focused on strong field performance, where our people are determined to win the confidence of the customer every day, and that provides us an important advantage.
The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected. We reported earlier this month that the number of idle FlexRigs was increasing and spot market pricing was down approximately 10%, and we expected additional softness in the market going forward. The outlook for pricing and activity continue to be lower, and we don't see the outlook improving during fiscal 2015.
I heard someone say recently, ""The job of correcting markets when they're oversupplied is to find a price that destroys the oversupply."" And in this case, the process that is required to destroy the oversupply is for E&P companies including our customers, to side light -- sideline hundreds of drilling rigs in the U.S. including H&P rigs.
Our field employee count is directly proportional to our rig count. Unfortunately, that means we have begun the process of making significant reductions to our workforce as we idle many of our rigs. Based on what we know today, it is possible that we will have approximately 2,000 or more field positions eliminated by the foreseeable rig reductions. This is, without question, the worst part of the downturn.
Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best-positioned drilling contractor. Fortunately, we still have 31 new builds to deliver, all sponsored with 3-year term contracts, a backlog of $4.6 billion to start the calendar year and term contract coverage of an average of approximately 160 rigs for the remainder of fiscal 2015.
Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, as I think about the outlook, our experience has taught us that in the face of a very negative market like we see today and a growing perception and panic of weaker-forever prices, the market does work, and eventually, all fundamentals improve.
Now Juan Pablo will give you more details on the first fiscal quarter and our outlook for the next quarter."

The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drill",1769,"Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling activity to significantly decline, the number of revenue days during the first fiscal quarter also represented a record level.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $295 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of early termination of long-term contracts. The number of revenue days increased by 2% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 297 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately 179 of these rigs were active under term contracts, and approximately 118 rigs were active in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day increased by 1.6% to $28,603. And the average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,046, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $15,557.
During the quarter, we generated approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications, we may generate over $60 million during the second fiscal quarter from additional early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts.
Since our last conference call in November, we have received termination notices for a total of approximately 22 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, 7 of which were estimated to have under 90 days of remaining contract duration and 7 of which have contract durations that extend beyond September 30, 2015, which is the end of our fiscal year.
As of today, the 340 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 243 active rigs and 97 idle rigs. All except 1 of our active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs. Of the 97 idle rigs, 73 are AC drive FlexRigs, and the remaining 24 idle rigs are SCR rigs. Included in the 243 rigs that are active today are 162 rigs under term contracts and 81 rigs in the spot market.
Looking ahead at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by roughly 25% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have less than 200 rigs active by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early-terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue to decline to levels between $27,000 and $27,500 per day. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,350 as we deal with some volatilities and significant changes in activity levels.
Subject to additional early terminations, and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, we have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 160 rigs during the second quarter and an average of about 137 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to remain roughly flat during the first -- excuse me, during the fiscal year as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed.
The quarterly average pricing for rigs in the spot market slightly increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 but is expected to significantly decline during the second fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is over 10% lower as compared to pricing for rigs now working under term contracts, whic of course, were negotiated over the last few years.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $21 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total quarterly days increased by about 10%, and the average rig margin per day declined to $20,732. All 9 of the company's platform rigs were active by the end of the first quarter.
As we look at the second quarter of 2015 -- of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to remain relatively flat, along with a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $19,500. Given current market conditions and some expected platform-to-platform rig mobilizations, we would not be surprised to see activity levels and average daily margins decline during the rest of the fiscal year.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter including some favorable retroactive pricing adjustments was approximately $8 million. But this is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $12 million during the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased to $10,770. And quarterly revenue days remained flat at an equivalent of about 23 active rigs.
As of today, our international land segment has 20 active rigs including 9 in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 each in Ecuador and Mozambique. 14 rigs are idle including 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Tonisia -- Tunisia, pardon me, and 1 in Bahrain. An additional 6 rigs already assigned to this segment are in various stages of transition from the U.S. to Argentina.
For the second fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decline by about 10% to 15%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 25% to 30% as compared to the first fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations.
We received early termination notification for a rig with a long-term contract that is now idle and expect approximately $8 million in early termination revenues from that contract. We also have ongoing discussions with a customer regarding the possibility of an additional rig contract early termination.
The daily margin weakness in this segment is primarily due to several rigs in transition and others becoming idle. The first 4 rigs related to our 10-rig YPF project have commenced operations in Argentina. We now expect to see roughly 700 revenue days from this project during the third fiscal quarter and to hopefully be at full activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The project's daily margins, that is the project's daily rig margins and contribution to the bottom line, are also expected to improve as this long-term project is fully deployed during the fiscal year and transitional expenses are behind us.
Let me now comment on corporate-level details. Given lower levels of expected activity during fiscal 2015 and a partial deferral of new FlexRig construction spending to fiscal 2016, we now estimate capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion during fiscal 2015. We are reducing the construction cadence to 2 FlexRigs per month beginning in June through the end of the calendar year, allowing us to have new build continuity as we go through this downturn while, at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog.
Roughly 70% of the CapEx estimate for fiscal 2015 corresponds to our new build program, less than 20% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The portion corresponding to our 2015 new build program also includes most of the major components in dollar value required for the 6 FlexRigs under term contracts that are now scheduled to be completed during early fiscal 2016.
Although we still expect to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 in excess of the $1.1 billion generated during fiscal 2014, we may need to externally fund a portion of our capital expenditures during the fiscal year.
With a debt-to-cap ratio today of approximately 2%, our balance sheet is in great shape to enable the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during fiscal 2015 and the 6 additional ones now scheduled for fiscal 2016, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 160 rigs across our drilling segment during the last 3 quarters of fiscal 2015, an average of almost 130 rigs during fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 100 rigs during fiscal 2017.
About 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with the benefit of an average pricing level that is expected to generate great margin per day averages that are higher than the $15,557 per day average corresponding to our most recent quarter. The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable, as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments.
Given changes in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2014, to approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter, as we earned a corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract terminations.
We still expect our total annual depreciation expense to be slightly over $600 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be slightly over $140 million.
The recent tax law change in bonus depreciation allowances resulted in a first fiscal quarter 2015 adjustment given a reduction of our 2014 cash taxes. This also increased our deferred taxes by approximately $100 million. This accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for cash tax purposes will favorably impact the company's liquidity during this fiscal year.
We expect the effective rate for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 to be between 35% and 36%. We repurchased approximately 810,000 shares during late November and early December of 2014 at slightly under $60 million. We did not repurchase additional shares after that time frame given the significant change in market conditions.
We have a 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2017. We're currently using -- pardon me, we are currently only using it for letters of credit and have over $250 million available to borrow under that facility.
As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. These holdings were recently valued at close to $150 million with an after-tax value of over $90 million.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And I'll close with a few comments regarding H&P's advantages and our outlook going forward before opening the call to questions.
H&P has an experienced management team and seasoned field operations personnel that know how to manage through a downturn. The experience gained in the company's 95 years will continue to serve us well.
And speaking of long-term service, I would like to acknowledge Steve Mackey on this call and his nearly 30 years with the company. Steve is retiring soon from his role as EVP, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer at the company. Steve worked closely with Hans for over 25 years, and I've been fortunate to work with Steve since 2006. He has contributed in many ways to the success of H&P. Steve, thank you for your many years of service, for your contributions, for your leadership, and every one at the company wishes you the best.
In addition to great people, we have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and access to capital. We have a large term contract backlog supported by a very strong customer base. Finally, we have the largest and most modern fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry. We believe our strategy has positioned the company to be competitive through the cycles. Whether we are faced with a downturn, like we are today, or in an improving market environment, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities ahead.
And now we will open the call for questions."

That's been hit pretty hard, where about 80% of the fleet has been released there. The Niobrara has had over 50%; Marcellus is around 50%; Woodbine, 60%; Bakken is 40% -- a little over 40%. So the -- for us, I think, a positive is our distribution of rigs in basins like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Both of those basins are our largest. Now we obviously have had several rigs released in each of those basins. But to give perspective, the Eagle Ford is down 25%, 28%, something like that; and the Permian is over 30%. So while we have had rigs released in those basins, it seems like those tend to be a little stronger in terms of the economics going forward."

You still have a large percentage of that, 57%, 58%, are mechanical, and 27% are SCR. So yes, we are impacted. I think -- and again, it's not anything you're in a position to brag about at all. But I mean, we're still in a situation where I think we're picking up a little incremental market share as the -- as this falling-knife situation is going on. So I do think, to answer your question, I have no idea what the outlook is in terms of when we reach bottom. Are oil prices -- have we reached that level now? I don't think there's a great certainty in the market that we've gotten there.

So while I -- again, it's a good question. I think, as I look at us and our overall fleet profile, one of the big advantages we have is this fleet continuity and uniformity and the size of the fleet and our ability to utilize standard processes for driving better drilling performance, rig move performance, safety performance. And I think all of those are advantages that will serve us well as we -- in the future as we come out of this downturn and customers begin to look at expanding their fleets and high grading their rig fleets.

Like I said, we're in this 300 to 500 range now, and many expect it to be closer to 900. So with that in mind, I would say we're going to continue to see rigs in the spot market released.

If that were to happen, then yes, we would see a reversal. But the reversal would be very slight. I -- we have a $1.3 billion liability related to deferred income taxes.

The bright light, of course, is related to the YPF project, where we have 10 FlexRigs under 5-year contracts each that are in the process of being deployed.

But -- so it's going to be a balancing act. We're pleased with the level of margins that we expect from our contracted rigs including those in Argentina. We have other contracts in other countries.

Low oil prices continue to depress de",934,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. The results corresponding to our second fiscal quarter were stronger than expected during this very turbulent time. Low oil prices continue to depress demand levels for drilling services during the transition into our third fiscal quarter. Even with the oil prices rebounding from the lows reached earlier this year, our customers have continued to release rigs, albeit at a slower pace. Although there appears to be some stabilization in the oil macro outlook, there are still uncertainty in the market, and our customers remain cautious. 
The industry rig count decline has been more swift and severe than we expected at the time of our last earnings call in late January. And we reviewed at that time as being more barish than most. While we don't believe we have reached the absolute bottom yet, we believe their indications of trough is nearing. Several industry analysts have predicted a trough count ranging from 850 to 750 rigs in the U.S. land market, and we believe that is a reasonable fairly given today's oil price environment and the discussions we have had with customers. 
We have commented that rig count reductions have been indiscriminate, and that trend continues. We are even in an development where our customers are releasing rigs based upon their liquidity as well as economic considerations. In many cases, regardless of the rig's performance, we estimate that approximately 40% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 31% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs makeup approximately 29%. 
Despite the reductions in our activity, there maybe another sign that the market is establishing a bottom. We have recently contracted a handful of FlexRigs in the spot markets to customers who are trading off, hydrating rigs and their drilling programs. 
Horizontal well complexity and factory-type drilling requirements in the ongoing U.S. energy revolution have changed the game for drilling contractors and other service providers. As a result, fewer mechanical and SCR rigs will be required in the future, especially in the rig category below 2,000 horsepower drill works rating. 
This morning, we announced the decommissioning of our first and second generation FlexRigs. These 17 SCR-powered rigs built in 1998 and 2001, were a very important strategic move in the company's history. The belief was that our customers would be willing to pay a higher day rate for a safer and more efficient rig than the success of that strategy led to H&P's investment at AC drive FlexRigs. And I'll talk more about that in a moment. 
Even though the Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs were a dramatic improvement over the legacy rig fleet, it has become evident, SCR-powered is the preferred technology for today's more complex well designs, while customers want is a AC drive technology. 
Now back to designing and building the first AC drive FlexRig, where we began with a clean sheet of paper and safety by design rig structures and power the design with AC drive technology. The value proposition to our customers was compelling, and the market finally embraced our efforts. We recognized a long time ago that eventually other contractors would builds AC rigs to compete with H&P. We often get the question, ""Are you concerned about your peers' new AC drive rigs?"" We answer that by saying, ""Our strategy has remained focused. Build the best rigs, employ the best people and create support systems and processes that continue to deliver the FlexRig value proposition to our customers."" 
The future holds many opportunities for H&P with FlexRig3, FlexRig4 and FlexRig5 makeup approximately 37% of the AC drive market share in the U.S. today, and FlexRig have an opportunity to take market share internationally as well. 
Before turning the call back to the Juan Pablo, let me mention a key element of our company culture. Our focus on continuous improvement and building a learning organization is a key advantage in both the highs and lows of the energy cycle. I am proud of what our people accomplished in 2014 for our customers, where we drilled 71 million fit of wellbore and operated over 325 rigs at the peak of activity in October of last year. 
In addition to setting records for footage and rig activity, our people continue to work on innovating technology solutions, safety, systems, cost control, systems and processes that position the company to be better prepared today than ever before, and certainly, better than we were then in 2009 downturn. 
The organization's response to this very severe reduction in rig count has been significant. Our field operations to date have idled over 150 rigs, taking care to preserve the rig and equipment integrity so we are ready to respond when the market improves. I believe our experienced leadership team provides us with an advantage to manage through the current downturn even more efficiently and effectively than during previous cycles. 
And let me close by saying, equally important to the tactical side of our business, is our continued strategic focus on our good effectiveness during this difficult times. We will continue to invest in systems and processes, which will allow us to efficiently scale operations to meet changing industry conditions and be prepared with our significant AC fleet capability to respond quickly to future demand levels. We believe this makes H&P the best position drilling contractor in the industry today. 
Now I'll turn the call to Juan Pablo, and he will give you more details on the second fiscal quarter and outlook for our next quarter. Juan Pablo?"

During this deep downturn that the industry is experiencing, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter and are expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. 
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $225 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. As expected, the number of quarterly revenue base today significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 231 active rigs during the second fiscal quarter, representing a 24% decline in revenue days as compared to the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 158 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 73 rigs work in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased about 3.6% to $27,575, and the average rig expense today increased by 2.7% to $13,395, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $14,190. 
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $71 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $75 million during the third fiscal quarter and over $30 million after that in early termination revenues. 
Since November of last year, we have received termination notices for a total of 44 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. 
Total early termination revenues related to these 44 contracts are now estimated at approximately $204 million. Approximately 90 of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $65 million during fiscal 2016 and $49 million after that. 
As of today, the 336 available rigs in the U.S. land segment, include approximately 165 AC drive FlexRigs generating revenue, and 171 idle rigs, including 163 idle AC drive FlexRigs. 
Included in the 165 rigs generating revenue, our 138 rigs under term contract and 27 rigs in the spot market. The 165 rigs generating revenue include rigs that are on standby-type day rate, and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to degrees by about 32% quarter-to-quarter, and that given the current trend, we could have approximately 150 rigs or less generating revenue days by the end of the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $27,000. The average rig expense per day is expected at roughly $13,600. 
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, the segment already have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 130 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, an average of about 117 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter and an average of about 107 rigs and 79 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively. 
The average rig margin per day levels for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters, as some rigs roll-off and new builds are deployed. 
The pricing for rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 15% from the first to the second quarter of fiscal 2015. And is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is about 23% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November. 
Let me now transitions to our offshore segment. Segment operating income declined to approximately  $19 million from $21 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decreased by about 2%, as 1 rig was demobilized and became idle during the second fiscal quarter. 
The average rig margin per day declined by about 10% to $18,671 during the second fiscal quarter, as 1 rig that continues generate revenue while stacked on the customer's platform, had a significant day rate and margin reduction. 8 of the company's 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days by the end of the second fiscal quarter. 
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decline by about 10%, as one of the 8 rigs generating revenue completes its current project is demobilized and becomes idle during the quarter. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $12,000 during the quarter. The expected average margin decline is mostly attributable to 3 rigs that are generating revenue days during the third fiscal partner, but that are now expected to be idle on the corresponding customer offshore platforms with new day rates and margins that are significantly lower as compared to regular operating the rates and margins. 
The total of 7 of the company's 9 offshore platform rigs are now expected to be generating revenue days at the end of the third fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contributions during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million and is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the third fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income decreased to approximately $6 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day corresponding to nearly contract termination revenues, the average rig margin per day slightly decreased to $10,524. As expected, quarterly revenue days decreased by about 11% to a an equivalent of slightly over 20 active rigs. 
As of today, our international land segment has 21 active rigs, including 12 in Argentina, 4 in Colombia, 2 in the UAE, 2 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 17 rigs are idle, including 3 that are under contract but no longer active. These 17 rigs include 5 in Argentina, 4 in Ecuador, 4 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. An additional 2 rigs are mobilizing to fill locations in Argentina.
For the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be flat, potentially increasing up to 5%. We expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 15% to 20% as compared to the second fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues in this segment of approximately $9 million during the third fiscal quarter and another $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, that corresponding to 2 rigs that are under contract but no longer active.
The expected daily margin decline in the segment is primarily due to rigs that are in transition and others becoming idle. We expect to see all 10 of the YPF project rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position is very long. We recently issued 10-year unsecured notes for $500 million, with 4.65% coupons and a 4.723% yield. Our capital expenditures estimates for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion, about 70% of which corresponds to the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Our fiscal 2015 construction cadence remains unchanged, but we are reducing our fiscal 2016 cadence to 1 FlexRig per month beginning in October through March ,which allows us to have greater new builds continuity as we go through this downturn, while at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog. 
Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during all of fiscal 2015 and the additional 6 rigs scheduled for fiscal 2016, we have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 148 rigs across our 3 drilling segments during the third fiscal quarter, and approximately 134 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. In addition, an average of about 121 rigs is already under contract during fiscal 2016, and an average of approximately 93 rigs during fiscal 2017.
The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments. 
Given the trends in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, to approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter as we earn related income through operations or through early contract terminations. 
We expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $600 million during fiscal 2015, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $140 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015, and the effective tax rate for the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2015 is expected to be between 34% and 35%. Our deferred income tax liability as of March 31, 2015 was approximately $1.32 billion. 
At this point, we expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion through at least the end of fiscal 2017.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

As we managed through the current decline in activity, our fleet size provides us with a distinct advantage. With the largest AC drive fleet available in the industry today, the company has unprecedented leverage to significantly increase activity levels during the future industry recovery and ongoing replacement cycle. 
In addition to our fleet advantage, H&P has over 1,600 rig years of AC drive experience. This experience provides the foundation to deliver superior value to our customers by providing innovative solutions and safer, more productive operations. We expect these efforts, along with the company's demonstrated capital discipline, to continue to result in pricing, margin and return on investment premiums that allow us to create value for our shareholders.

So it's up slightly from what you quoted from the previous presentation. I think it will probably continue to increase. And that you'll see over time, of course, is that as older --  because there are some older rigs, legacy rigs and then underperforming rigs that are under term contract that as they roll off, there's possibility that those rigs could be high graded. So that would be our expectation. That's what we saw in 2009 and 2010. Our customers, operators in general, looking for opportunities. The other advantage of this type of the market is the ability to attract new customers. In 2009 and 2010, we were able to attract a lot of new customers to H&P because we didn't have to sign a 3-year term contract, they didn't have to wait in line. They were able to grab an available FlexRig and put it to work and test drive it and see how it worked out. Another data point is in the horizontal and directional market, AC rigs have approximately 59% market share. So again, you can just see that there is another large percentage of rigs that are mechanical and SCR that are drilling horizontal and directional that are drilling some pretty challenging complex wells. So that offers a great upside for us."

So we believe that it's clear that it's of there. It doesn't mean that we're implying that there won't ever be or there won't be mechanical and SCR rigs working in the future. I think that there will be. But I do think it's going to be a fewer number. We've talked about it on our last call, you can go back and review the notes, I'm not going to try to recap it, but with each successive peak and trough, it was each successive cycle you see fewer and fewer mechanical and SCR rigs going back to 2005. And that trend will continue. One of the components in addition to customers that's important, and I didn't touched on this earlier when Angie asked a question about people, and that is the new rigs, AC drive FlexRigs, are so much better to work on, they're safer, they're more environmentally conducive to working on this just an easier work environment.

But as I think about it, I take your 800 or so trough number of rigs work with the U.S. would seems to be a reasonable peak to trough drop about 60%. Is actually appears on par, if not an excess of the drop in the E&P cash flow. and more importantly, the E&P has adjusted their activity levels to the improvement in the spending power that comes through the system. And I've realized this takes time. But why don't we just happen in the second half of the year? Should we expect, do you expect a decent rebound in activity before year end, call it 100-plus rigs? Once these cleared, what I assume is a modest backlog [indiscernible] wells. You're just sticking through the impact of this improvement in spending power. Certainly, the capital markets to the E&P's. So curious of your outlook on rebound potential before year end."

Our senses is, like we talked about in our opening comments, our sense is it feels like we're finding a floor. As you know, there are so many variables involved and things that are unexpected that could happen, which is why I think, again, we continue to see our customers being cautious. But you're right, we said, we talked about on our last call that markets work, and eventually they work and oil prices have a tendency to overshoot on the high side, on the low side. There's a lot of forces working out there that could potentially contribute to exactly what you said. And so I think your reasoning is right on target, it's just a very difficult situation to try to call it. I think there are a lot of people out there now that seem to be leaning more towards the second half of the year, in the first part of 2016 and starting to see some improvement. And so I think that's a reasonable assumption. But I sure don't want to try to call it."

In any event, it ends up having a dilutive effect. We would prefer to continue to grow the company organically. We see some real synergies associated with having the fleet that we have, and that's part of what we're speaking to as we talk about processes and systems as we move forward.

We're starting to see a little bit of a spot market develop now. I mean, obviously, it's going to come down to competitors deciding at what level they're going to price rigs at. I think for us right now, we're down, I think Juan Pablo said we're down 23% spot pricing. To remind you, in '09, 2009, spot pricing was down approximately 30% from the peak. So we've kind of thought that 30% was a reasonable type of an estimate. I'm not --  I don't think we can call a bottom or in a spot market pricing at this stage because I think we're still really early on developing the spot market. However, I will say, I think, an interesting point to keep in mind is that while we have 30% market share on the AC, our next 3 largest peers have approximately 38%. So 75% is a market share of AC is by 4 contractors and then there's approximately 20 that make up the other 25%. So it's a relatively small group of competitors out there, and so you would think there would be some pricing discipline. I know I've heard some of our larger peers talk about that and being willing to depend a certain level of pricing. So that would be our expectations going forward. But it's -- I don't think we're in a position where we can call the trough on spot market pricing."

At the end of the day, with the customers that just have more rigs on term than they can handle with their budgets. And the lowest cost alternative for them is to early terminate the rig. And really, think about that, it's a fairly low cost option to get out from underneath that forward spend, and I think that's how a lot of the customers have looked at it. Have excess to the best rigs event would they get into the situation, they just early terminate the rigs. I don't --  I'm not overly concerned by that.

Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. The results corresponding to our second fiscal quarter were stronger than expected during this very turbulent time. Low oil prices continue to depress",932,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. 
The results corresponding to our second fiscal quarter were stronger than expected during this very turbulent time. Low oil prices continue to depress demand levels for drilling services during the transition into our third fiscal quarter. Even with oil prices rebounding from the lows reached earlier this year, our customers have continued to re-lease rigs, albeit at a slower pace. Although there appears to be some stabilization in the oil macro outlook, there are still uncertainty in the market, and our customers remain cautious. 
The industry rig count decline has been more swift and severe than we expected at the time of our last earnings call in late January. And we reviewed at that time as being more bearish than most. While we don't believe we have reached the absolute bottom yet, we do believe there are indications that the trough is nearing. Several industry analysts have predicted a trough count ranging from 850 to 750 rigs in the U.S. land market, and we believe that is a reasonable fairly given today's oil price environment and the discussions we have had with customers. 
We have commented that rig count reductions have been indiscriminate, and that trend continues. Yet even in an development where customers are re-leasing rigs based upon their liquidity as well as economic considerations, in many cases regardless of the rig's performance, we estimate that approximately 40% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 31% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs makeup approximately 29%. 
Despite the reductions in our activity, there may be another sign that the market is establishing a bottom. We have recently contracted a handful of FlexRigs in the spot market to customers who are trading up hydrating rigs in their drilling programs. 
Horizontal well complexity and factory-type drilling requirements in the ongoing U.S. energy revolution have changed the game for drilling contractors and other service providers. As a result, fewer mechanical and SCR rigs will be required in the future, especially in the rig categories below 2,000 horsepower drawworks rating. 
This morning, we announced the decommissioning of our first and second generation FlexRigs. These 17 SCR-powered rigs built in 1998 and 2001 were a very important strategic move in the company's history. The belief was that our customers would be willing to pay a higher day rate for a safer and more efficient rig, and the success of that strategy led to H&P's investment in AC drive FlexRigs. And I'll talk more about that in a moment. 
Even though the Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs were a dramatic improvement over the legacy rig fleet, it has become evident SCR power isn't the preferred technology for today's more complex well designs. What customers want is AC drive technology. 
Now back to designing and building the first AC drive FlexRig, where we began with a clean sheet of paper and safety by design rig structures and power the design with AC drive technology. The value proposition to our customers was compelling, and the market finally embraced our efforts. We recognized a long time ago that eventually, other contractors would build AC rigs to compete with H&P. We often get the question, ""Are you concerned about your peers' new AC drive rigs?"" We answer that by saying, ""Our strategy has remained focused: build the best rigs, employ the best people and create support systems and processes that continue to deliver the FlexRig value proposition to our customers."" 
The future holds many opportunities for H&P. The FlexRig3, FlexRig4 and FlexRig5 makeup approximately 37% of the AC drive market share in the U.S. today, and FlexRigs have an opportunity to take market share internationally as well. 
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, let me mention a key element of our company culture. Our focus on continuous improvement and building a learning organization is a key advantage in both the highs and lows of the energy cycle. I am proud of what our people accomplished in 2014 for our customers, where we drilled over 71 million feet of wellbore and operated over 325 rigs at the peak of activity in October of last year. 
In addition to setting records for footage and rig activity, our people continue to work on innovative technology solutions, safety systems, cost control systems and processes that position the company to be better prepared today than ever before and certainly better than we were in the 2009 downturn. 
The organization's response to this very severe reduction in rig count has been significant. Our field operations to date have idled over 150 rigs, taking care to preserve the rig and equipment integrity so we are ready to respond when the market improves. I believe our experienced leadership team provides us with an advantage to manage through the current downturn even more efficiently and effectively than during previous cycles. 
And let me close by saying equally important to the tactical side of our business is our continued strategic focus on organizational effectiveness during these difficult times. We will continue to invest in systems and processes, which will allow us to efficiently scale operations to meet changing industry conditions and be prepared with our significant AC fleet capability to respond quickly to future demand levels. We believe this makes H&P the best position drilling contractor in the industry today. 
Now I'll turn the call to Juan Pablo, and he'll give you more details on the second fiscal quarter and the outlook for next quarter. Juan Pablo?"
278341,290802501,793050,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $150 million in net income, $227 million in operating income and $883 million in revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Given the steep downturn that the industry is experiencing, these quarterly levels we",1578,"Thank you, John. The company reported $150 million in net income, $227 million in operating income and $883 million in revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Given the steep downturn that the industry is experiencing, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter and are expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. 
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $225 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. As expected, the number of quarterly revenue days significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 231 active rigs during the second fiscal quarter, representing a 24% decline in revenue days as compared to the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 158 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 73 rigs work in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased by 3.6% to $27,575, and the average rig expense per day increased by 2.7% to $13,395, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $14,180. 
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $71 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $75 million during the third fiscal quarter and over $30 million after that in early termination revenues. 
Just November of last year, we have received termination notices for a total of 44 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. 
Total early termination revenues related to these 44 contracts are now estimated at approximately $204 million, approximately $90 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $65 million during fiscal 2016 and $49 million after that. 
As of today, the 336 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 165 AC drive FlexRigs generating revenue and 171 idle rigs, including 163 idle AC drive FlexRigs. 
Included in the 165 rigs generating revenue are 138 rigs under term contracts and 27 rigs in the spot market. The 165 rigs generating revenue include rigs that are on standby-type day rate and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to  decrease by about 32% quarter-to-quarter and given the current trend, we could have approximately 150 rigs or less generating revenue days by the end of the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $27,000. The average rig expense per day is expected at roughly $13,600. 
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, the segment already have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 130 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, an average of about 117 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter and an average of about 107 rigs and 79 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively. 
The average rig margin per day levels for these rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters, as some rigs roll-off and new builds are deployed. 
The pricing for rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 15% from the first to the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is about 23% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November. 
Let me now transition to our offshore segment. Segment operating income declined to approximately  $19 million from $21 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decreased by about 2%, as one rig was demobilized and became idle during the second fiscal quarter. 
The average rig margin per day declined by about 10% to $18,671 during the second fiscal quarter, as one rig that continues to generate revenue while stacked on the customer's platform had a significant day rate and margin reduction. 8 of the company's 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days by the end of the second fiscal quarter. 
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decline by about 10%, as 1 of the 8 rigs generating revenue completes its current project, is demobilized and becomes idle during the quarter. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $12,000 during the quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is mostly attributable to 3 rigs that are generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter but that are now expected to be idled on the corresponding customer offshore platforms with new day rates and margins that are significantly lower as compared to regular operating day rates and margins. 
A total of 7 of the company's 9 offshore platform rigs are now expected to be generating revenue days at the end of the third fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million and is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the third fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income decreased to approximately $6 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day corresponding to early contract termination revenues, the average rig margin per day slightly decreased to $10,524. As expected, quarterly revenue days decreased by about 11% to an equivalent of slightly over 20 active rigs. 
As of today, our international land segment has 21 active rigs, including 12 in Argentina, 4 in Colombia, 2 in the UAE, 2 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 17 rigs are idle, including 3 that are under contract but no longer active. These 17 rigs include 5 in Argentina, 4 in Ecuador, 4 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. An additional 2 rigs are mobilizing to fill locations in Argentina.
For the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be flat, potentially increasing up to 5%. We expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 15% to 20% as compared to the second fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues in this segment of approximately $9 million during the third fiscal quarter and another $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, corresponding to 2 rigs that are under contract but no longer active.
The expected daily margin decline in the segment is primarily due to rigs that are in transition and others becoming idle. We expect to see all 10 of the YPF project rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Let me now comment on corporate-level details. Our liquidity position is very long. We recently issued 10-year unsecured notes for $500 million with 4.65% coupons and a 4.723% yield. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion, about 70% of which corresponds to the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Our fiscal 2015 construction cadence remains unchanged, but we are reducing our fiscal 2016 cadence to one FlexRig per month beginning in October through March ,which allows us to have greater new builds continuity as we go through this downturn, while at the same time not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog. 
Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during all of fiscal 2015 and the additional 6 rigs scheduled for fiscal 2016, we have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 148 rigs across our 3 drilling segments during the third fiscal quarter, and approximately 134 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. In addition, an average of about 121 rigs is already under contract during fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 93 rigs during fiscal 2017.
The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments. 
Given the trends in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, to approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter as we earn related income through operations or through early contract terminations. 
We expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $600 million during fiscal 2015, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $140 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015, and the effective tax rate for the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2015 is expected to be between 34% and 35%. Our deferred income tax liability as of March 31, 2015, was approximately $1.32 billion. 
At this point, we expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion through at least the end of fiscal 2017.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

Of course, as you said, we -- I think we have 15% of the active fleet at the peak in '08 that was AC drive. So it is going to be a different environment. It's hard to say exactly where pricing will be. I think our expectation would be in the spot market, similar to what we saw in '09, were in the high teens range. The rigs that we're going to be competing against, there will still be some head-to-head competition with AC on AC. But you still have a significant number of SCR and mechanical rigs that are out working today, drilling unconventional resource plays but really are designed to adequately address the challenges and deliver to tough cycle times that an AC rig can deliver."

We have a lot of experienced, skilled personnel on the rigs that are working and, in a lot of cases, lower positions, so those guys are always eager to move up into that next role, that next slot. And I personally don't think it's going to be a challenge. The other advantage that we have in our business, of course, is that when you compare the earnings that a guy can have working a year in oilfield compared to building houses or other types of competitive jobs, there's really not a great comparison. And so I think people are typically eager to come back. And I think with H&P specifically, we could -- have created a lot of job opportunities and upward mobility, and our guys have seen that through the cycles. We've grown more quickly than our peers.

So it's up slightly from what you quoted from the previous presentation. I think it will probably continue to increase. And what you'll see over time, of course, is that as older --  because there are some older rigs, legacy rigs and then underperforming rigs that are on term contract, that as they roll off, there's possibility that those rigs could be high graded. So that would be our expectation. That's what we saw in 2009 and 2010. Our customers, operators in general, looking for an opportunity. The other advantage to this type of a market is the ability to attract new customers. In 2009 and 2010, we were able to attract a lot of new customers to H&P because they didn't have to sign a 3-year term contract. They didn't have to wait in line. They were able to grab an available FlexRig and put it to work and test drive it and see how it worked out. Another data point is in the horizontal and directional market, AC rigs have approximately 59% market share. So again, you can just see that there's another large percentage of rigs that are mechanical and SCR rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional that are drilling some pretty challenging complex wells. So that offers a great upside for us."

So we believe that it's clear that it's there. It doesn't mean that we're implying that there won't ever be or there won't be mechanical and SCR rigs working in the future. I think that there will be, but I do think it's going to be a fewer number. We've talked about it on our last call, you can go back and review the notes, I'm not going to try to recap it, but with each successive peak and trough, it was each successive cycle you see fewer and fewer mechanical and SCR rigs kind of dating back to 2005, and that trend will continue. One of the components in addition to customers that's important, and I didn't touch on this earlier when Angie asked a question about people, and that is the new rigs, AC drive FlexRigs, are so much better to work on. They're safer. They're more environmentally conducive to working on. It's just an easier work environment. And so -- and that has a real attraction to people. So you're going to  get the best people that are going to be working on the newer rigs, which puts a lot of pressure again on rigs that were designed in 70 -- 60, 70s and 80s."

We've heard some from some other industry participants this morning, John, unwillingness to call an inflection point at least in the second half of the year. But as I think about it, I take your 800 or so trough number of rigs working in the U.S. which seemed reasonable. The peak-to-trough drop of about 60%, this actually appears on par, if not an excess of the drop in E&P cash flow. And more importantly, the E&Ps have adjusted their activity levels to the improvement in spending power that's come through the system. I've realized this takes time, but why doesn't this happen in the second half of the year? Should we expect -- do you expect a decent rebound in activity before year-end, call it 100-plus rigs, once we've cleared what I assume is a modest backlog of uncompleted wells?

I think for us right now, we're down -- I think Juan Pablo said we're down 23% spot pricing. To remind you, in '09, 2009, spot pricing was down approximately 30% from the peak. So we've kind of thought that 30% was a reasonable type of an estimate. I'm not --  I don't think we can call a bottom on spot market pricing at this stage of the game because I think we're still really early in on developing the spot market. However, I will say, I think, an interesting point to keep in mind is that while we have 30% market share on the AC, our next 3 largest peers have approximately 38%. So 75% is -- of the market share of AC is by 4 contractors and then there's approximately 20 that make up the next, the other 25%. So it's a relatively small group of competitors out there, and so you would think there would be some pricing discipline.

At the same time, as we began to kind of think about it a little bit, you contrast with the number of early terminations that we have in 2008 and 2009, we had close to 40. And at that time, we had, like I said earlier, a working rig fleet of about 185. At this time, we're closer to 300, and we're at 44. So it doesn't feel like it's really out of balance that the early terminations in general have been less than a year left on the term contract. So on a percentage basis, it's --  I don't think it's out of touch. I think it really just gets to -- down to the bottom at the end of it.  At the end of the day, we've got customers that just have more rigs on term than they can handle with their budgets, and the lowest-cost alternative for them is to early terminate the rig. And really, think about  it, it's a fairly low-cost option to get out from underneath that forward spend, and I think that's how a lot of the customers have looked at it. Have excess to the best rigs and then when they get into that situation, they just early terminate the rig. So I don't --  I'm not overly concerned by it. I am surprised, however, that it has gotten to that level, but as I started thinking about it, contrasting it, it's a lower percentage than what we saw. I think it's less than 15%, and back in '09 and 2010, it was over 20% of our fleet."

Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. The results corresponding to our second fiscal quarter were stronger than expected during this very turbulent time. Low oil prices continue to depress",934,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. 
The results corresponding to our second fiscal quarter were stronger than expected during this very turbulent time. Low oil prices continue to depress demand levels for drilling services during the transition into our third fiscal quarter. Even with oil prices rebounding from the lows reached earlier this year, our customers have continued to release rigs, albeit at a slower pace. Although there appears to be some stabilization in the oil macro outlook, there is still uncertainty in the market, and our customers remain cautious. 
The industry rig count decline has been more swift and severe than we expected at the time of our last earnings call in late January. And we were viewed at that time as being more bearish than most. While we don't believe we have reached the absolute bottom yet, we do believe there are indications that the trough is nearing. Several industry analysts have predicted a trough count ranging from 850 to 750 rigs in the U.S. land market, and we believe that is a reasonable fairway given today's oil price environment and the discussions we have had with customers. 
We have commented that rig count reductions have been indiscriminate and that trend continues. Yet even in an environment where customers are releasing rigs based upon their liquidity as well as economic considerations, in many cases, regardless of a rig's performance, we estimate that approximately 40% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 31% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs make up approximately 29%. 
Despite the reductions in our activity, there may be another sign that the market is establishing a bottom. We have recently contracted a handful of FlexRigs in the spot market to customers who are trading up hydrating rigs in their drilling programs. 
Horizontal well complexity and factory type drilling requirements in the ongoing U.S. energy revolution have changed the game for drilling contractors and other service providers. As a result, fewer mechanical and SCR rigs will be required in the future, especially in the rig categories below 2,000 horsepower drawworks rating. 
This morning, we announced the decommissioning of our first and second generation FlexRigs. These 17 SCR-powered rigs built in 1998 and 2001 were a very important strategic move in the company's history. The belief was that our customers would be willing to pay a higher day rate for a safer and more efficient rig, and the success of that strategy led to H&P's investment in AC drive FlexRigs. And I'll talk more about that in a moment. 
Even though the Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs were a dramatic improvement over the legacy rig fleet, it has become evident SCR power isn't the preferred technology for today's more complex well designs. What customers want is AC drive technology. 
Now back to designing and building the first AC drive FlexRig, where we began with a clean sheet of paper and safety-by-design rig structures and powered the design with AC drive technology. The value proposition to our customers was compelling and the market finally embraced our efforts. We recognized a long time ago that eventually other contractors would build AC rigs to compete with H&P. We often get the question, ""Are you concerned about your peers' new AC drive rigs?"" We answer that by saying, ""Our strategy has remained focused: build the best rigs, employ the best people and create support systems and processes that continue to deliver the FlexRig value proposition to our customers."" 
The future holds many opportunities for H&P. The FlexRig3, FlexRig4 and FlexRig5 make up approximately 37% of the AC drive market share in the U.S. today and FlexRigs have an opportunity to take market share internationally as well. 
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, let me mention a key element of our company culture. Our focus on continuous improvement and building a learning organization is a key advantage in both the highs and lows of the energy cycle. I am proud of what our people accomplished in 2014 for our customers, where we drilled over 71 million feet of wellbore and operated over 325 rigs at the peak of activity in October of last year. 
In addition to setting records for footage and rig activity, our people continue to work on innovative technology solutions, safety systems, cost control systems and processes that position the company to be better prepared today than ever before and certainly better than we were in the 2009 downturn. 
The organization's response to this very severe reduction in rig count has been significant. Our field operations to date have idled over 150 rigs, taking care to preserve the rig and equipment integrity so we are ready to respond when the market improves. I believe our experienced leadership team provides us with an advantage to manage through the current downturn even more efficiently and effectively than during previous cycles. 
And let me close by saying equally important to the tactical side of our business is our continued strategic focus on organizational effectiveness during these difficult times. We will continue to invest in systems and processes, which will allow us to efficiently scale operations to meet changing industry conditions and be prepared with our significant AC fleet capability to respond quickly to future demand levels. We believe this makes H&P the best positioned drilling contractor in the industry today. 
Now I'll turn the call to Juan Pablo, and he'll give you more details on the second fiscal quarter and the outlook for next quarter. Juan Pablo?"
278341,290802501,793263,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $150 million in net income, $227 million in operating income and $883 million in revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Given the steep downturn that the industry is experiencing, these quarterly levels we",1583,"Thank you, John. The company reported $150 million in net income, $227 million in operating income and $883 million in revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Given the steep downturn that the industry is experiencing, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter and are expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. 
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $225 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. As expected, the number of quarterly revenue days significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 231 active rigs during the second fiscal quarter, representing a 24% decline in revenue days as compared to the first fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 158 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 73 rigs worked in the spot market. 
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased by 3.6% to $27,575, and the average rig expense per day increased by 2.7% to $13,395, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $14,180. 
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $71 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $75 million during the third fiscal quarter and over $30 million after that in early termination revenues. 
Since November of last year, we have received termination notices for a total of 44 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. 
Total early termination revenues related to these 44 contracts are now estimated at approximately $204 million, approximately $90 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $65 million during fiscal 2016 and $49 million after that. 
As of today, the 336 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 165 AC drive FlexRigs generating revenue and 171 idle rigs, including 163 idle AC drive FlexRigs. 
Included in the 165 rigs generating revenue are 138 rigs under term contracts and 27 rigs in the spot market. The 165 rigs generating revenue include rigs that are on standby type day rates and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 32% quarter-to-quarter and, given the current trend, we could have approximately 150 rigs or less generating revenue days by the end of the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $27,000. The average rig expense per day is expected at roughly $13,600. 
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 130 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, an average of about 117 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter and an average of about 107 rigs and 79 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively. 
The average rig margin per day levels for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters, as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed. 
The pricing for rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 15% from the first to the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is about 23% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November. 
Let me now transition to our offshore segment. Segment operating income declined to approximately  $19 million from $21 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decreased by about 2%, as one rig was demobilized and became idle during the second fiscal quarter. 
The average rig margin per day declined by about 10% to $18,671 during the second fiscal quarter, as one rig that continues to generate revenue days while stacked on the customer's platform had a significant day rate and margin reduction. 8 of the company's 9 offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days by the end of the second fiscal quarter. 
As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decline by about 10%, as 1 of the 8 rigs generating revenue completes its current project, is demobilized and becomes idle during the quarter. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $12,000 during the quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is mostly attributable to 3 rigs that are generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter but that are now expected to be idled on the corresponding customer offshore platforms with new day rates and margins that are significantly lower as compared to regular operating day rates and margins. 
A total of 7 of the company's 9 offshore platform rigs are now expected to be generating revenue days at the end of the third fiscal quarter. 
Management contracts on platform rigs continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million and is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the third fiscal quarter. 
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income decreased to approximately $6 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day corresponding to early contract termination revenues, the average rig margin per day slightly decreased to $10,524. As expected, quarterly revenue days decreased by about 11% to an equivalent of slightly over 20 active rigs. 
As of today, our international land segment has 21 active rigs, including 12 in Argentina, 4 in Colombia, 2 in the UAE, 2 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 17 rigs are idle, including 3 that are under contract but no longer active. These 17 rigs include 5 in Argentina, 4 in Ecuador, 4 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. An additional 2 rigs are mobilizing to field locations in Argentina.
For the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be flat, potentially increasing up to 5%. We expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 15% to 20% as compared to the second fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues in this segment of approximately $9 million during the third fiscal quarter and another $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, corresponding to 2 rigs that are under contract but no longer active.
The expected daily margin decline in the segment is primarily due to rigs that are in transition and others becoming idle. We expect to see all 10 of the YPF project rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position is very strong. We recently issued 10-year unsecured notes for $500 million with 4.65% coupons and a 4.723% yield. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion, about 70% of which corresponds to the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. 
Our fiscal 2015 construction cadence plan remains unchanged, but we are reducing our fiscal 2016 cadence to 1 FlexRig per month beginning in October through March ,which allows us to have greater new build continuity as we go through this downturn, while at the same time not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog. 
Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during all of fiscal 2015 and the additional 6 rigs scheduled for fiscal 2016, we have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 148 rigs across our 3 drilling segments during the third fiscal quarter and approximately 134 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. In addition, an average of about 121 rigs is already under contract during fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 93 rigs during fiscal 2017.
The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments. 
Given the trend in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, to approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter as we earn related income through operations or through early contract terminations. 
We expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $600 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $140 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015 and the effective tax rate for the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2015 is expected to be between 34% and 35%. Our deferred income tax liability as of March 31, 2015, was approximately $1.32 billion. 
At this point, we expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion through at least the end of fiscal 2017.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

As we manage through the current decline in activity, our fleet size provides us with a distinct advantage. With the largest AC drive fleet available in the industry today, the company has unprecedented leverage to significantly increase activity levels during a future industry recovery and ongoing replacement cycle. 
In addition to our fleet advantage, H&P has over 1,600 rig years of AC drive experience. This experience provides a foundation to deliver superior value to our customers by providing innovative solutions and safer, more productive operations. We expect these efforts, along with the company's demonstrated capital discipline, to continue to result in pricing, margin and return on investment premiums that allow us to create value for our shareholders.

Those rigs haven't worked really the last couple of years. We have had some different opportunities to potentially sell those rigs. 
But really, the Flex 3s, 4s and 5s,  the Flex 3s that we built in 2002 to 2004, if you recall the first 32 we built, those rigs have continued to work. They're both spot and term. And they've been in a situation where they've typically commanded the same type of revenues and margins that we've seen with our newer Flex 3s. Some have skid systems and some don't. It's kind of a mixed bag. 
But I feel real good about where we are in terms of drilling with those rigs going forward. We do have, I just wanted to remind you, too, we do have 8 3,000 horsepower SCR rigs, one of which we worked at the end of last year on the deep project, deep gas project in South Louisiana. We'll continue to have those rigs. We have 2,000 and 3,000 horsepower SCR rigs working in South America. And then, of course, we have our first 3,000 horsepower AC rig also working in South America, working in Colombia. 
So I feel good about where we are. And I think those rigs, that we've continued to upgrade those rigs over time in just about every way possible. They continue to deliver great value for customers, and I feel good about where we are with those rigs."

The other advantage that we have in our business, of course, is that when you compare the earnings that a guy can have working a year in the oil field compared to building houses or other types of competitive jobs, there's really not a great comparison.

And I think with H&P specifically we have created a lot of job opportunities and upward mobility, and our guys have seen that through the cycles. We've grown more quickly than our peers.

I'm assuming it was on the other rig as well. They were high teens type rates, kind of what we've talked about. 
The value proposition is clearly there. I mean, you've seen our value proposition slide that we've shown for years, where we're saving 10%, 15%, 20% on a well, we have a higher day rate, and we're able to save the customer money as well as deliver more wells in a given year by working that rig. 
So our belief continues to be that there will be a replacement cycle -- the replacement cycle will continue. However, again, I've stated, too, it's just a handful of rigs.

And what you'll see over time, of course, is that as older --  because there are some older rigs, legacy rigs and then underperforming rigs that are on term contract, that as they roll off, there's possibility that those rigs could be high-graded. 
So that would be our expectation. That's what we saw in 2009 and 2010. Our customers, operators in general, are looking for an opportunity. The other advantage to this type of a market is the ability to attract new customers. In 2009 and 2010, we were able to attract a lot of new customers to H&P because they didn't have to sign a 3-year term contract. They didn't have to wait in line. They were able to grab an available FlexRig and put it to work and test drive it and see how it worked out. 
Another data point is, in the horizontal and directional market, AC rigs have approximately 59% market share. So again, you can just see that there's another large percentage of rigs that are mechanical and SCR rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional that are drilling some pretty challenging, complex wells. So that offers a great upside for us."

But John, is there a scenario where maybe some less competitive rigs stick around because operators choose them because -- on price, for example? If those rigs are going for $12,000 a day and an AC type rig is going for $18,000 to $20,000 a day, is that $6,000 gap there in the day rate, is that enough to sway an operator to stick with the less competitive rig? Do you have a sense of that?"

So we believe that it's clear and that it's there. It doesn't mean that we're implying that there won't ever be or there won't be mechanical and SCR rigs working in the future. I think that there will be. But I do think it's going to be a fewer number. We've talked about it on our last call, you can go back and review the notes, I'm not going to try to recap it, but with each successive peak and trough, with each successive cycle you see fewer and fewer mechanical and SCR rigs, kind of dating back to 2005. And that trend will continue. 
One of the components in addition to customers that's important, and I didn't touch on this earlier when Angie asked a question about people, and that is the new rigs, AC drive FlexRigs, are so much better to work on. They're safer. They're more environmentally conducive to working on. It's just an easier work environment. And so -- and that has a real attraction to people. So you're going to get the best people that are going to be working on the newer rigs, which puts a lot of pressure, again, on rigs that were designed in the '70s -- '60s, '70s and '80s."

We've heard some from some other industry participants this morning a general unwillingness to call an inflection point, at least in the second half of the year. But as I think about it, I take your 800 or so trough number of rigs working in the U.S, which seems reasonable, if the peak-to-trough drop of about 60%, this actually appears on par, if not in excess of the drop in E&P cash flow. And more importantly, the E&Ps haven't adjusted their activity levels to the improvement in spending power that's come through the system. I realize this takes time, but why doesn't this happen in the second half of the year? Should we expect -- do you expect a decent rebound in activity before year-end, call it 100-plus rigs, once we've cleared what I assume is a modest backlog of uncompleted wells? Just thinking through the impact of this improvement in spending power, and certainly the capital markets are open to the E&Ps. So just interested in your outlook on rebound potential before year-end."

There's a lot of forces working out there that could potentially contribute to exactly what you said. And so I think your reasoning is right on target; it's just a very difficult situation to try to call it.

In any event, it ends up having a dilutive effect. 
We would prefer to continue to grow the company organically. We see some real synergies associated with having the fleet that we have and that's part of what we're speaking to as we talk about processes and systems as we move forward.

We're starting to see a little bit of a spot market develop now. I mean, obviously, it's going to come down to competitors deciding at what level they're going to price rigs at. I think for us right now, we're down -- I think Juan Pablo said we're down 23% on spot pricing. 
To remind you, in '09, 2009, spot pricing was down approximately 30% from the peak. So we've kind of thought that 30% was a reasonable type of an estimate. I'm not -- I don't think we can call a bottom on spot market pricing at this stage of the game because I think we're still really early in on developing the spot market. 
However, I will say I think an interesting point to keep in mind is that, while we have 30% market share of the AC, our next 3 largest peers have approximately 38%. So 75% is -- of the market share of AC is by 4 contractors. And then there's approximately 20 that make up the next, the other 25%. 
So it's a relatively small group of competitors out there, and so you would think there would be some pricing discipline. I know I've heard some of our larger peers talk about that and being willing to defend a certain level of pricing. So that would be our expectation going forward, but it's -- I don't think we're in a position where we can call the trough on spot market pricing."

And I think I even commented on the last call that we were surprised at the ones that we had received. At the same time, as we began to kind of think about it a little bit, you contrast with the number of early terminations that we had in 2008 and 2009, we had close to 40. And at that time we had, like I said earlier, a working rig fleet of about 185. This time we're closer to 300 and we're at 44. 
So it doesn't feel like it's really out of balance. The early terminations in general have been less than a year left on the term contract. So on a percentage basis it's --  I don't think it's out of touch. I think it really just gets to -- down to the bottom, at the end of it, at the end of the day, we've got customers that just have more rigs on term than they can handle with their budgets, and the lowest-cost alternative for them is to early-terminate the rig. And really, if you think about  it, it's a fairly low-cost option to get out from underneath that forward spend. And I think that's how a lot of the customers have looked at it. Have excess to the best rigs and then, when they get into that situation, they just early-terminate the rig. 
So I don't -- I'm not overly concerned by it. I am surprised, however, that it had gotten to that level, but as I started thinking about it and contrasting it, it's a lower percentage than what we saw. I think it's less than 15%. And back in '09 and 2010, it was over 20% of our fleet."

Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. You may recall at the time of our last conference call in April, the U.S. land rig count were still declining at sea period and they were elected to call th",947,"Thanks, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. You may recall at the time of our last conference call in April, the U.S. land rig count were still declining at sea period and they were elected to call the bottom. There have been several indications since then at the trough was approaching and the rig count did appear to bottom out, but today seeing oil prices decline by over $10 per barrel over the past several weeks, that bottom could soon prove to be false. This is unfortunate for all of our is in the energy sector, who had hoped to see at least some recovery in the back half of 2015.
The industry over 1,150 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in 2014. That's made up of approximately 720 legacy SER and mechanical rigs and approximately 440 AC drive rigs.  H&P alone has idled over a 180 AC Drive FlexRigs.
While cost management in this kind of declining environment becomes a company-wide priority, the challenge is to initiate reductions with the right balance. That undertaking involves rightsizing the organization as well as preserving our FlexRig assets for the future. One important aspect in the process is awarding indiscriminate reductions that damage our capacity to readily respond to your reversal and market conditions.
Although Juan Pablo is going to address expenses in a moment, I want to mention that much of the quarterly expense per day increase is associated with our systematic approach to idling our AC FlexRigs. During the '08 and '09 downturn, we identified several best practices for idling AC rigs and preserving equipment integrity. We put those learnings into practice when the downturn began. There are 3 points I want to underscore relating to this process.
First, our currently idle fleet is worth billions of dollars in terms of replacement value. We take great care to preserve that value. Second, a portion of the preservation effort entails operating, maintenance and security procedures, which does add to our per day expense. Could we delay that expense today, perhaps some of it, but we see our approach as a long-term investment in our FlexRigs. It's a case of pay me now or pay me more later.
Finally, the replacement cycle will continue. As the industry's high-grade process moves forward, our ability to respond in a timely and efficient manner will position the company for more opportunities and will ultimately allow us provide greater value to customers. Our rig preservation process enables our FlexRigs to be prepared to work when the customer is ready. We believe in terms of speed and scope, our ability to place rigs back into service during the last recovery created significant value for our shareholders. That quick response capability remains one of our key goals today.
Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage. The FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. We have over 310  AC Drive FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating, which represents over 90% of our U.S. land fleet. In many of the basins we work, the requirement it for longer laterals, multi-well pads and higher horsepower specifications.
We have over 180 pad optimal FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating AC Drive Power Systems, multi-oil pad capability and to a significant extent, 7,500 psi systems. Today and in the future, our organization remains focused on supporting our customers through innovations to our service offerings as well as upgrades to our fleet as needed.
Not all rigs require multi-well pad and/or 7,500 psi systems today. But as we have outlined on previous calls, we are seeing preferences shift and more E&P companies are choosing AC Drive technology or horizontal, unconventional resource drilling. AC drive rigs continue to replace the legacy rigs. And today, have over 50% of the U.S. land industry market share. And that's up from 40% at the peak last year.
There are a significant competitive advantages for H&P by having a standardized modern fleet of AC drive FlexRigs. We are able to leverage the learnings we capture and provide greater efficiencies, reliability, safety and savings for our customers. We've been fortunate to have picked up over 10 new customers this year and that new customer adoption is a result of our performance and reliability.
Before turning the call back over to Juan Pablo, I want to address the outlook for activity for the rest of 2015. We know better than try to predict oil prices rigs count, so I won't attend that today. I will share a few anecdotal experiences from the past few weeks, the from the customer of what may happen assuming oil prices don't improve from here.
First, we've seen instances where some customers have at least for now backed off of plans for reactivations in the second half of '15. Secondly, some customers believe it's reasonable to assume that the current U.S. land rig count may not be sustainable with WTI oil priced in the 40s. Finally, operators remain disciplined with respect to their budgets. And they plan to spend within cash flow and lower commodity prices means fewer wells drilled.
This remains a very challenging environment, but we believe the company is well positioned. Long-term contracts continue to protect our investments. The balance sheet is in great shape. Our customer base remain strong. And our competitive advantages have positioned us to manage through this cycle and to capture opportunities when they emerge.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo and he will make few comments regarding the results of our third fiscal quarter and some remarks related to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter."
278341,306146023,842810,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $91 million of net income, $130 million in operating income and $660 million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior qua",1774,"Thank you, John. The company reported $91 million of net income, $130 million in operating income and $660 million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $122 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 156 rigs generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter and representing a 32% decline in revenue days as compared to the second fiscal quarter.  On average, approximately 128 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 28 rigs were in the spot market.
Excluding the anti- determination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased by 3.4% from the second fiscal quarter to $26,634 in the third fiscal quarter. And the average rig expense per day increased by 5.5% to $14,130, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,504 in the third fiscal quarter.
The decline in average rig revenue per day was attributable to -- to market conditions and to mutually beneficial temporary day rate reductions for some rigs that are under long-term contracts. Those temporary day rate introductions were granted in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced date rates. Also fully protecting the backlog for the corresponding rig and effectively extending the duration of the corresponding work.
The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of the high volume of idled rigs and related efforts to be cost-effective through the cycle and well-positioned for a potential industry recovery.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $76 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate less than $4 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and about $23 million thereafter in early terminations revenues.
Since November of last year and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contracts as per prior written notice to us, we have received early terminations for a total of 47 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 47 contracts are now estimated at slightly under $200 million, approximately $87 million of which corresponds to cash flow, previously expected to be generated through a normal operations during fiscal 2015, $62 million during fiscal 2016 and $49 million after that.
As of today, our 342 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 156 AC drive FlexRigs, generating revenue and 186 idled rigs, including 179 idle AC drive FlexRigs. Included in the 156 rigs generating revenue, our 124 rigs under term contracts and 32 rigs in the spot market.
The 156 rigs generating revenue include some rigs that are on standby type day rates and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Now that these delayed new build rigs do not yet generate revenue days. Since our last conference call in late April, the number of FlexRigs on standby tape day rates have significantly declined, has over half of those have returned to work.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 3% to 4% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect on average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to decline to roughly $13,900 as we continue to manage the transition towards what we expect to be a more stable level of activity during the next few months.
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early terminations notifications for, the segment already have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 120 during the fourth fiscal quarter. And an average of about 108 rigs and 82 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
The recent and mutually beneficial negotiations of some long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced levels, impacted the average rig margin per day level for all rigs on term contracts by less than 5%. This average for rig that are already under term contract is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters as some rigs rolloff and new builds are deployed.  The average is expected to once again increase to previous levels when they mentioned day rates reduction expire and the remaining term contract durations from those contracts begin to once again apply.
The average pricing for rigs in the stock market decline by approximately 7% from the second to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. And is expected to continued to at least slightly decline during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is about 28% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $15 million from $19 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decrease by about 8% as 1 rig was demobilized and -- at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Also is expected, the average rig margin per day declined by about 24% to $14,265 during the third fiscal quarter. As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat. As 1 platform rig that was expected to become ideal was recently contracted by another customer and continued generating revenue days, while being prepared for the new project.
We expect this segment's average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $10,500 during the fourth fiscal quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is mostly attributable to 4 rigs that are not performing operations, but that are generating relatively low margins on their standby type day rates.
And 1 rig that is earning a temporarily reduced operating day rate to accommodate for a special project that is expected to expand a total duration of the overall profit. The latter arrangement is mutually beneficial as it extends the total duration of the project while fully protecting our minimum term contract duration at fully priced day rates.
Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. The contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million and is expected to decline to approximate $6 million during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased by approximately $10 million to over $16 million during the third fiscal quarter. The increase was mostly attributable to early termination compensation earned during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day and $4,658 per day, corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the second and third quarters, respectively, the average rig margin per day increased from $10,524 to $13,086 per day.  This increase was a result of strong performance during the quarter in all of the countries where we have active rigs, even while dealing with several rigs in transition.
Revenue days sequentially increased by about 2% to an average of over 20 active rigs during the third fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment have 17 active rigs, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Columbia, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain.
23 rigs our ideal, including 8 in Argentina, 6 in Columbia, 5 in Ecuador, 2 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Thus, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down by 10% to 15% for the fourth fiscal quarter.
We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 30% to 35% as compared to the third fiscal quarter excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues of approximately $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter in the segment.
The expected daily rig margin decline in the segment is primarily due to expenses corresponding to several rigs that have become ideal and 2 rigs that are scheduled to be demobilized out of Tunisia.
Let me now comment on some corporate level details.  Our liquidity position is very strong and we expect no change to our regular dividend $1 per share levels in the foreseeable future. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion. Although we don't plan to provide a capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2016, until our next conference call in November, at this point, we would expect the fiscal 2016 estimate to be significantly lower than the one for fiscal 2015.
Our FlexRig construction plan remained generally the same with 12 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. Including the long-term contracts for these 12 new FlexRigs, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 137 rigs across our 3 segments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
In addition, and also for all 3 segments combined, an average of about 122 rigs is already under contract for fiscal 2016, and an average of approximately 95 rigs for fiscal 2017.
Given the soft market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015 to approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015. The value of our backlog is respected to continue to decline during the fourth fiscal quarter as we earned related income through operations or through any additional, but at this time, unexpected early contract termination compensation.
We now expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $580 million during fiscal 2015, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $130 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest still expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015.
The effective income tax rate for the third fiscal quarter was 28.9%. This reduced rate was mostly a result of a favorable adjustment to our U.S. deferred state income tax rate caused by less activity in the states where we operate in as well as decreases to some of the state income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately 34%.
Our deferred income tax liability as of June 30, 2015 was approximately $1.33 billion. We still expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 million through at least the end of fiscal 2017.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And that opportunity initially presented itself -- I guess, was 2013, we had a little bit of a slow start at the time, we had probably 20 ideal AC rigs and so we sourced those rigs out of the U.S and so there's no doubt there is an opportunity. The FlexRigs have clearly performed well in every country that we've worked. The performance has been outstanding. So I think there is opportunities, not only in South America, but I think there's also continued opportunities in the Middle East. So I do think this slowdown in our capability and having those rigs available in the U.S. does give us the opportunity to expand our international fleet."

And as we looked at the impact of these renegotiations on that average rig margin per day for term contracts, we determined that the -- that impact was under 5%. So within the next several months, probably less than a year, we would expect those temporary reductions to expire and to go back to prior fully priced levels, which would yield again the type of margins where we were at before these reduction. So we would expect to get that approximately 5% back once -- again, once we have these temporary reductions expire. Does that bring clarity?"

We're in the 40s, we are mid- to high-40 range and again, I think even in that price environment, we are more than likely to going to see the behaviors that I mentioned, which is some rigs that were previously going to be reactivated on the back half of '15, most likely won't be unless oil prices improve. The question is at what oil price. And again, I think we saw the industry beginning to move, you saw the rig count begin to flatten and you began to see more discussion regarding rigs in the spot market. But in this pricing environment, I just don't think you are going to see that. In fact, I think, you could see the rig count pullback some. So again, it's a challenge. I think in order to see the rig count begin to improve, we're going to have to see a strong oil price environment than what we've seen. If you recall and I think it was in the last round of earnings calls, there were some that are expecting a 200 rig increase by the end of the year. And we said, we just didn't see that. I mean, we couldn't see how there could -- that could happen. That we were at that time, of course, we weren't expecting oil to pullback into the 40s. I mean, the reality as I think if you went out to survey, 10 different E&P operators, you would get a pretty wide range of expectation on pricing and I think a lot of folks are taking oil prices are going to be lower as opposed to moving higher. But again, I'm not here to predict the oil price, I'm just telling you what we've heard from customers and others in the industry, I think you guys have heard the same thing."

And so, if we -- so what ever recoveries scenario we want to assume, is it fair to thing that as we see some of your idle AC rigs go back to work, 12, 18 months, that big rig expense per day should gravitate back down closer to what it's been historically and call 13,000 or 13,003 range -- just somewhere in that historical ranges deal appropriate way to think about your true rig expense per day.

And at the same time, your average number rigs working is lower, so your denominator is smaller, so you just have a higher cost. But as rigs are idle longer, the expense is lower. We are not spending that same level of money that we are day 90 on as we are in the first 30 to 60 days. So I think your expectation is right. I think -- and again, we've talked about this, and we're not going to throw a number out there. But $13,000 is achievable again in the future with more rigs running. I don't exactly know what that number rig the number of rig count is. But I think as we begin to get more clarity over the next couple of quarters, we'll see that. I can tell you we're spending a lot of time and effort on the cost side.

So the day rates were only impacted by a few percentage points, a couple of percentage points, maybe 2 or 3. So those out remained flat, while since November, as I've mentioned, we've had a decline in the average spot pricing for rigs of about 28%. I think it is fair to assume that at the peak, the average rig, excuse me, the average day rates or pricing for rigs on term was similar. I think, it was maybe up a couple of percentage points higher than the average spot pricing at that point. So those are some data points for consideration. And of course, now, again, I just want to make sure I clarified -- the term day rates or average pricing that we saw at the peak last year has come down slightly temporarily, and we expect it to come back up as I've mentioned previous answers, right?"

There is the maintenance in supply cost the other side, the other larger piece or largest piece of the cost. And again, I think we're is a good position has anyone to be able to manage that as effectively as possible with the fleet that we have, the size that we have and the fleet uniformity. But the fact is hear -- me say this before, but the fact is the rigs are working harder and harder because the drilling longer laterals and higher pump pressures and the other is just more -- the rigs are drilling faster, well is faster cycle times. So that's working against us so to speak on getting the maintenance in the supply cost down. So there is efforts that we have underway to work on that.

Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. You may recall at the time of our last conference call in April, the U.S. land rig count was still declining at a steep rate, and we were reluctant to call",950,"Thanks, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. You may recall at the time of our last conference call in April, the U.S. land rig count was still declining at a steep rate, and we were reluctant to call a bottom. There have been several indications since then that the trough was approaching and the rig count did appear to bottom out. But today, seeing oil prices decline by over $10 per barrel over the past several weeks, that bottom could soon prove to be false. This is unfortunate for all of us in the energy sector, who had hoped to see at least some recovery in the back half of 2015.
The industry has idled over 1,150 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in 2014. That's made up of approximately 720 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs and approximately 440 AC drive rigs. H&P alone has idled over 180 AC drive FlexRigs. While cost management in this kind of declining environment becomes a company-wide priority, the challenge is to initiate reductions with the right balance. That undertaking involves rightsizing the organization as well as preserving our FlexRig assets for the future. One important aspect in the process is avoiding indiscriminate reductions that unduly damage our capacity to readily respond to a reversal in market conditions. 
Although Juan Pablo is going to address expenses in a moment, I want to mention that much of the quarterly expense per day increase is associated with our systematic approach to idling our AC FlexRigs. During the '08 and '09 downturn, we identified several best practices for idling AC rigs and preserving equipment integrity. We put those learnings into practice when the downturn began. There are 3 points I want to underscore relating to this process.
First, our currently idle fleet is worth billions of dollars in terms of replacement value. We take great care to preserve that value. Second, a portion of the preservation effort entails operating, maintenance and security procedures, which does add to our per day expense. Could we delay that expense today? Perhaps some of it, but we see our approach as a long-term investment in our FlexRigs. It's a case of pay me now or pay me more later. Finally, the replacement cycle will continue. As the industry's high-grade process moves forward, our ability to respond in a timely and efficient manner will position the company for more opportunities and will ultimately allow us to provide greater value to customers. Our rig preservation process enables our FlexRigs to be prepared to work when the customer is ready. We believe in terms of speed and scope, our ability to place rigs back into service during the last recovery created significant value for our shareholders. That quick response capability remains one of our key goals today.
Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage. The FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. We have over 310 AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating, which represents over 90% of our U.S. land fleet. In many of the basins we work, the requirement is for longer laterals, multiwell pads and higher horsepower specifications. We have over 180 pad-optimal FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating, AC drive power systems, multiwell pad capability and to a significant extent, 7,500 psi mud systems. Today and in the future, our organization remains focused on supporting our customers through innovations to our service offering as well as upgrades to our fleet as needed.
Not all rigs require multiwell pad and/or 7,500 psi systems today. But as we have outlined on previous calls, we are seeing preferences shift and more E&P companies are choosing AC drive technology for horizontal unconventional resource drilling. AC drive rigs continue to replace legacy rigs, and today, have over 50% of the U.S. land industry market share. And that's up from 40% at the peak last year. There are significant competitive advantages for H&P by having a standardized modern fleet of AC drive FlexRigs. We're able to leverage the learnings we capture and provide greater efficiencies, reliability, safety and savings for our customers. We've been fortunate to have picked up over 10 new customers this year. And that new customer adoption is a result of our performance and reliability.
Before turning the call back over to Juan Pablo, I want to address the outlook for activity for the rest of 2015. We know better than to try to predict oil prices or rig count, so I won't attempt that today. I will share a few anecdotal experiences from the past few weeks, the tone from the customer of what may happen assuming oil prices don't improve from here. First, we've seen instances where some customers have, at least for now, backed off of plans for reactivations in the second half of '15. Secondly, some customers believe it's reasonable to assume that the current U.S. land rig count may not be sustainable with WTI oil priced in the 40s. Finally, operators remain disciplined with respect to their budgets. And they plan to spend within cash flow and lower commodity prices mean fewer wells drilled.
This remains a very challenging environment, but we believe the company is well positioned. Long-term contracts continue to protect our investments. The balance sheet is in great shape. Our customer base remains strong. And our competitive advantages have positioned us to manage through this cycle and to capture opportunities when they emerge.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo, and he'll make a few comments regarding the results of our third fiscal quarter and some remarks related to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter."
278341,306146023,843165,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $91 million of net income, $130 million in operating income and $660 million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior qua",1776,"Thank you, John. The company reported $91 million of net income, $130 million in operating income and $660 million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $122 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 156 rigs generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter and representing a 32% decline in revenue days as compared to the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 128 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 28 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased by 3.4% from the second fiscal quarter to $26,634 in the third fiscal quarter. And the average rig expense per day increased by 5.5% to $14,130, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,504 in the third fiscal quarter. The decline in average rig revenue per day was attributable to softer market conditions and to mutually beneficial temporary day rate reductions for some rigs that are under long-term contracts. Those temporary day rate reductions were granted in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced day rates, also fully protecting the backlog for the corresponding rigs and effectively extending the duration of the corresponding work. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of the high volume of idled rigs and related efforts to be cost-effective through the cycle and well positioned for a potential industry recovery.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $76 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate less than $4 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and about $23 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Since November of last year and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contracts as per prior written notice to us, we have received early terminations for a total of 47 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 47 contracts are now estimated at slightly under $200 million, approximately $87 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $62 million during fiscal 2016 and $49 million after that.
As of today, our 342 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 156 AC drive FlexRigs generating revenue and 186 idled rigs, including 179 idle AC drive FlexRigs. Included in the 156 rigs generating revenue are 124 rigs under term contracts and 32 rigs in the spot market. The 156 rigs generating revenue include some rigs that are on standby-type day rates and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Note that these delayed new build rigs do not yet generate revenue days. Since our last conference call in late April, the number of FlexRigs on standby-type day rates have significantly declined as over half of those have returned to work.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue days to decrease by about 3% to 4% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to decline to roughly $13,900 as we continue to manage the transition towards what we expect to be a more stable level of activity during the next few months. Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 120 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter and an average of about 108 rigs and 82 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
The recent and mutually beneficial negotiations of some long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced levels impacted the average rig margin per day level for all rigs on term contracts by less than 5%. This average for rig that are already under term contracts is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed. The average is expected to once again increase to previous levels when the mentioned day rate reductions expire and the remaining term contract durations from those contracts begin to once again apply. The average pricing for rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 7% from the second to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to at least slightly decline during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is about 28% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $15 million from $19 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decrease by about 8% as 1 rig was demobilized and became idle at the end of the second fiscal quarter. Also as expected, the average rig margin per day declined by about 24% to $14,265 during the third fiscal quarter. As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat as 1 platform rig that was expected to become idle was recently contracted by another customer and continued generating revenue days while being prepared for the new project. 
We expect the segment's average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $10,500 during the fourth fiscal quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is mostly attributable to 4 rigs that are not performing operations but that are generating relatively low margins on their standby-type day rates and 1 rig that is earning a temporarily reduced operating day rate to accommodate for a special project that is expected to expand the total duration of the overall project. The latter arrangement is mutually beneficial as it extends the total duration of the project while fully protecting our minimum term contract duration at fully priced day rates. Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million and is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased by approximately $10 million to over $16 million during the third fiscal quarter. The increase was mostly attributable to early termination compensation earned during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day and $4,658 per day, corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the second and third quarters, respectively, the average rig margin per day increased from $10,524 to $13,086 per day. This increase was a result of strong performance during the quarter in all of the countries where we have active rigs, even while dealing with several rigs in transition.
Revenue days sequentially increased by about 2% to an average of over 20 active rigs during the third fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 17 active rigs, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 23 rigs are idle, including 8 in Argentina, 6 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, 2 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Thus, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down by 10% to 15% for the fourth fiscal quarter.
We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 30% to 35% as compared to the third fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues of approximately $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter in the segment. The expected daily rig margin decline in the segment is primarily due to expenses corresponding to several rigs that have become idle and 2 rigs that are scheduled to be demobilized out of Tunisia.
Let me now comment on some corporate-level details. Our liquidity position is very strong, and we expect no change to our regular dividend dollar per share levels in the foreseeable future. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion. Although we don't plan to provide a capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2016 until our next conference call in November, at this point, we would expect the fiscal 2016 estimate to be significantly lower than the one for fiscal 2015.
Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same with 12 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. Including the long-term contracts for these 12 new FlexRigs, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 137 rigs across our 3 segments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition and also for all 3 segments combined, an average of about 122 rigs is already under contract for fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 95 rigs for fiscal 2017.
Given the soft market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015, to approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the fourth fiscal quarter as we earn related income through operations or through any additional but at this time unexpected early contract termination compensation. We now expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $580 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $130 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is still expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015.
The effective income tax rate for the third fiscal quarter was 28.9%. This reduced rate was mostly a result of a favorable adjustment to our U.S. deferred state income tax rate caused by less activity in the states where we operate in as well as decreases to some of the state income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately 34%. Our deferred income tax liability as of June 30, 2015, was approximately $1.33 billion. We still expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion through at least the end of fiscal 2017.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And before we open the call to questions, I want to make to a few additional comments to frame up the challenges and opportunities ahead for H&P. 
The challenges are clear. Faced with a global oversupply of oil as well as other geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds that intensify the supply-demand imbalance, the short-term outlook for the industry is unfavorable. However, a significant difference today compared to previous down cycles is that the U.S. may be in a position to become a global swing producer. In such an environment, the energy services landscape would most probably become more competitive with even greater pressure to reduce well cost, enhance productivity and add value for customers. 
We believe that type of a market is a great opportunity for H&P. Our long-term strategy has delivered a track record of innovation, performance and value creation for customers. Our people remain committed to this endeavor and we look forward to the opportunities ahead. 
So Lindy, we will now open the call for questions."

The FlexRigs have clearly performed well in every country that we've worked. The performance has been outstanding. So I think there's opportunities, not only in South America, but I think there's also continued opportunities in the Middle East.

The question is at what oil price? And again I think we saw the industry beginning to move. You saw the rig count begin to flatten. And you began to see more discussions regarding rigs in the spot market. But in this pricing environment, I just don't think you're going to see that. In fact, I think you could see the rig count pull back some. So again it's a challenge. I think in order to see the rig count begin to improve, we're going to have to see a stronger oil price environment than what we've seen. If you recall, and I think it was in the last round of earnings calls, there were some that were expecting a 200-rig increase by the end of the year. And we said, ""We just didn't see that."" I mean, we couldn't see how there could -- that could happen. Now we weren't -- at that time, of course, we weren't expecting oil to pull back into the 40s. I mean, the reality is I think if you went out and surveyed 10 different E&P operators, you would get a pretty wide range of expectation on pricing. And I think a lot of folks are thinking oil prices are going to be lower as opposed to moving higher.

Well, and you saw that Juan Pablo had talked about our cost expectations for the next quarter. But you're right. I mean, part of the challenge, of course, is the rigs that are idle have an ongoing expense, and at the same time, your average number of rigs working is lower. So your denominator is smaller, so you just have a higher cost. But as rigs are idle longer, the expense is lower. We're not spending that same level of money that we are day 90 on as we are in the first 30 to 60 days. So I think your expectation is right. I think -- and again we've talked about this and we're not going to throw a number out there, but $13,000 is achievable again in the future with more rigs running. I don't exactly know what that number of rig count is. But I think as we begin to get more clarity over the next couple of quarters, we'll see that. I can tell you we're spending a lot of time and effort on the cost side.

And then as we trend more towards higher number of rigs drilling on pads and a higher number of rigs that require 7,500 psi that have greater depth requirement, a lot of those things disqualify some of those maybe describe them as lower tier AC assets. So again it will be interesting to watch. Now does the market -- the other part of your question is does the market get strong enough to have rates that will support new build economics? And we're a long way from that."

Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. You may recall at the time of our last conference call in April, the U.S. land rig count was still declining at a steep rate, and we were reluctant to call",950,"Thanks, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. You may recall at the time of our last conference call in April, the U.S. land rig count was still declining at a steep rate, and we were reluctant to call a bottom. There have been several indications since then that the trough was approaching and the rig count did appear to bottom out. But today, seeing oil prices decline by over $10 per barrel over the past several weeks, that bottom could soon prove to be false. This is unfortunate for all of us in the energy sector who had hoped to see at least some recovery in the back half of 2015.
The industry has idled over 1,150 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in 2014. That's made up of approximately 720 legacy SCR and mechanical rigs and approximately 440 AC drive rigs. H&P alone has idled over 180 AC drive FlexRigs. While cost management in this kind of declining environment becomes a company-wide priority, the challenge is to initiate reductions with the right balance. That undertaking involves rightsizing the organization as well as preserving our FlexRig assets for the future. One important aspect in the process is avoiding indiscriminate reductions that unduly damage our capacity to readily respond to a reversal in market conditions. 
Although Juan Pablo is going to address expenses in a moment, I want to mention that much of the quarterly expense per day increase is associated with our systematic approach to idling our AC FlexRigs. During the '08 and '09 downturn, we identified several best practices for idling AC rigs and preserving equipment integrity. We put those learnings into practice when the downturn began. There are 3 points I want to underscore relating to this process.
First, our currently idle fleet is worth billions of dollars in terms of replacement value. We take great care to preserve that value. Second, a portion of the preservation effort entails operating, maintenance and security procedures, which does add to our per day expense. Could we delay that expense today? Perhaps some of it, but we see our approach as a long-term investment in our FlexRigs. It's a case of pay me now or pay me more later. Finally, the replacement cycle will continue. As the industry's high-grade process moves forward, our ability to respond in a timely and efficient manner will position the company for more opportunities and will ultimately allow us to provide greater value to customers. Our rig preservation process enables our FlexRigs to be prepared to work when the customer is ready. We believe, in terms of speed and scope, our ability to place rigs back into service during the last recovery created significant value for our shareholders. That quick response capability remains one of our key goals today.
Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage. The FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. We have over 310 AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating, which represents over 90% of our U.S. land fleet. In many of the basins we work, the requirement is for longer laterals, multiwell pads and higher horsepower specifications. We have over 180 pad-optimal FlexRigs with 1,500-horsepower rating, AC drive power systems, multiwell pad capability and to a significant extent, 7,500 psi mud systems. Today and in the future, our organization remains focused on supporting our customers through innovations to our service offering as well as upgrades to our fleet as needed.
Not all rigs require multiwell pad and/or 7,500 psi systems today. But as we have outlined on previous calls, we are seeing preferences shift and more E&P companies are choosing AC drive technology for horizontal unconventional resource drilling. AC drive rigs continue to replace legacy rigs, and today, have over 50% of the U.S. land industry market share. And that's up from 40% at the peak last year. There are significant competitive advantages for H&P by having a standardized modern fleet of AC drive FlexRigs. We're able to leverage the learnings we capture and provide greater efficiencies, reliability, safety and savings for our customers. We've been fortunate to have picked up over 10 new customers this year. And that new customer adoption is a result of our performance and reliability.
Before turning the call back over to Juan Pablo, I want to address the outlook for activity for the rest of 2015. We know better than to try to predict oil prices or rig count, so I won't attempt that today. I will share a few anecdotal experiences from the past few weeks, the tone from the customer of what may happen assuming oil prices don't improve from here. First, we've seen instances where some customers have, at least for now, backed off of plans for reactivations in the second half of '15. Secondly, some customers believe it's reasonable to assume that the current U.S. land rig count may not be sustainable with WTI oil priced in the 40s. Finally, operators remain disciplined with respect to their budgets. And they plan to spend within cash flow and lower commodity prices mean fewer wells drilled.
This remains a very challenging environment, but we believe the company is well positioned. Long-term contracts continue to protect our investments. The balance sheet is in great shape. Our customer base remains strong. And our competitive advantages have positioned us to manage through this cycle and to capture opportunities when they emerge.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo, and he'll make a few comments regarding the results of our third fiscal quarter and some remarks related to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter."
278341,306146023,843439,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. The company reported $91 million of net income, $130 million in operating income and $660 million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior qua",1776,"Thank you, John. The company reported $91 million of net income, $130 million in operating income and $660 million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $122 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 156 rigs generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter and representing a 32% decline in revenue days as compared to the second fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 128 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 28 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased by 3.4% from the second fiscal quarter to $26,634 in the third fiscal quarter. And the average rig expense per day increased by 5.5% to $14,130, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,504 in the third fiscal quarter. The decline in average rig revenue per day was attributable to softer market conditions and to mutually beneficial temporary day rate reductions for some rigs that are under long-term contracts. Those temporary day rate reductions were granted in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced day rates, also fully protecting the backlog for the corresponding rigs and effectively extending the duration of the corresponding work. The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of the high volume of idled rigs and related efforts to be cost-effective through the cycle and well positioned for a potential industry recovery.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $76 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate less than $4 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and about $23 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Since November of last year and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contracts as per prior written notice to us, we have received early terminations for a total of 47 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 47 contracts are now estimated at slightly under $200 million, approximately $87 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $62 million during fiscal 2016 and $49 million after that.
As of today, our 342 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 156 AC drive FlexRigs generating revenue and 186 idled rigs, including 179 idle AC drive FlexRigs. Included in the 156 rigs generating revenue are 124 rigs under term contracts and 32 rigs in the spot market. The 156 rigs generating revenue include some rigs that are on standby-type day rates and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Note that these delayed new build rigs do not yet generate revenue days. Since our last conference call in late April, the number of FlexRigs on standby-type day rates have significantly declined as over half of those have returned to work.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue days to decrease by about 3% to 4% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to decline to roughly $13,900 as we continue to manage the transition towards what we expect to be a more stable level of activity during the next few months. Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 120 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter and an average of about 108 rigs and 82 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
The recent and mutually beneficial negotiations of some long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced levels impacted the average rig margin per day level for all rigs on term contracts by less than 5%. This average for rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed. The average is expected to once again increase to previous levels when the mentioned day rate reductions expire and the remaining term contract durations from those contracts begin to once again apply. The average pricing for rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 7% from the second to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to at least slightly decline during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is about 28% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $15 million from $19 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decreased by about 8% as one rig was demobilized and became idle at the end of the second fiscal quarter. Also as expected, the average rig margin per day declined by about 24% to $14,265 during the third fiscal quarter. As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal '15, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat as one platform rig that was expected to become idle was recently contracted by another customer and continued generating revenue days while being prepared for the new project. 
We expect the segment's average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $10,500 during the fourth fiscal quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is mostly attributable to 4 rigs that are not performing operations but that are generating relatively low margins on their standby-type day rates and one rig that is earning a temporarily reduced operating day rate to accommodate for a special project that is expected to expand the total duration of the overall project. The latter arrangement is mutually beneficial as it extends the total duration of the project while fully protecting our minimum term contract duration at fully priced day rates. Management contracts on platform rigs continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million and is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased by approximately $10 million to over $16 million during the third fiscal quarter. The increase was mostly attributable to early termination compensation earned during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day and $4,658 per day, corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the second and third quarters, respectively, the average rig margin per day increased from $10,524 to $13,086 per day. This increase was a result of strong performance during the quarter in all of the countries where we have active rigs, even while dealing with several rigs in transition.
Revenue days sequentially increased by about 2% to an average of over 20 active rigs during the third fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 17 active rigs, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 23 rigs are idle, including 8 in Argentina, 6 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, 2 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Thus, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down by 10% to 15% for the fourth fiscal quarter.
We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 30% to 35% as compared to the third fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues of approximately $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter in the segment. The expected daily rig margin decline in the segment is primarily due to expenses corresponding to several rigs that have become idle and 2 rigs that are scheduled to be demobilized out of Tunisia.
Let me now comment on some corporate-level details. Our liquidity position is very strong, and we expect no change to our regular dividend dollar per share levels in the foreseeable future. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion. Although we don't plan to provide a capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2016 until our next conference call in November, at this point, we would expect the fiscal 2016 estimate to be significantly lower than the one for fiscal 2015.
Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same with 12 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. Including the long-term contracts for these 12 new FlexRigs, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 137 rigs across our 3 segments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition and also for all 3 segments combined, an average of about 122 rigs is already under contract for fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 95 rigs for fiscal 2017.
Given the soft market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015, to approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the fourth fiscal quarter as we earn related income through operations or through any additional but at this time unexpected early contract termination compensation. We now expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $580 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $130 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is still expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015.
The effective income tax rate for the third fiscal quarter was 28.9%. This reduced rate was mostly a result of a favorable adjustment to our U.S. deferred state income tax rate caused by less activity in the states where we operate in as well as decreases to some of the state income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately 34%. Our deferred income tax liability as of June 30, 2015, was approximately $1.33 billion. We still expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion through at least the end of fiscal 2017.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And before we open the call to questions, I want to make to a few additional comments to frame up the challenges and opportunities ahead for H&P. 
The challenges are clear. Faced with a global oversupply of oil as well as other geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds that intensify the supply-demand imbalance, the short-term outlook for the industry is unfavorable. However, a significant difference today compared to previous down cycles is that the U.S. may be in a position to become a global swing producer. In such an environment, the energy services landscape would most probably become more competitive with even greater pressure to reduce well costs, enhance productivity and add value for customers. 
We believe that type of a market is a great opportunity for H&P. Our long-term strategy has delivered a track record of innovation, performance and value creation for customers. Our people remain committed to this endeavor and we look forward to the opportunities ahead. 
So Lindy, we will now open the call for questions."

The FlexRigs have clearly performed well in every country that we've worked. The performance has been outstanding.

So we would expect to get that approximately 5% back again once we have these temporary reductions expire. Does that bring clarity to your question?"

The follow-up question I have, John, you indicated kind of early on or given some indications of tone and tenor of the customer base and indicated that 40 -- the rig count would be unsustainable at a $40 oil price. And I think we can understand that pretty well. And maybe digging a little bit deeper into some of this tone and tenor. So overall, are you then getting the impression that the E&P mindset is that oil is going to remain around kind of current levels, $50-plus levels? And at these levels that there's no upside or no downside to activity? How would you characterize the viewpoints on that?"

And again I think even in that price environment, we're more than likely going to see the behaviors that I mentioned, which is some rigs that were previously going to be reactivated on the back half of '15 most likely won't be unless oil prices improve. The question is at what oil price? And again I think we saw the industry beginning to move. You saw the rig count begin to flatten. And you began to see more discussions regarding rigs in the spot market. But in this pricing environment, I just don't think you're going to see that. In fact, I think you could see the rig count pull back some. So again, it's a challenge. I think in order to see the rig count begin to improve, we're going to have to see a stronger oil price environment than what we've seen. If you recall, and I think it was in the last round of earnings calls, there were some that were expecting a 200-rig increase by the end of the year. And we said -- we just didn't see that. I mean, we couldn't see how there could -- that could happen. Now we weren't -- at that time, of course, we weren't expecting oil to pull back into the 40s. I mean, the reality is I think if you went out and surveyed 10 different E&P operators, you would get a pretty wide range of expectation on pricing. And I think a lot of folks are thinking oil prices are going to be lower as opposed to moving higher. But again, I'm not here to predict the oil price, I'm just telling you what we've heard from customers and others in the industry. I think you guys have heard the same thing."

We're not spending that same level of money that we are day 90 on as we are in the first 30 to 60 days. So I think your expectation is right. I think -- and again we've talked about this and we're not going to throw a number out there, but $13,000 is achievable again in the future with more rigs running.

The day rate and pricing for term contracts has remained very steady, except for what I mentioned earlier as relates to these temporary renegotiations that impacted margins by about 5%. So the day rates were only impacted by a few percentage points, a couple of percentage points, maybe 2 or 3. So those have remained flat while since November, as I've mentioned, we've had a decline in the average spot pricing for rigs of about 28%. I think it is fair to assume that at the peak, the average rig -- the average day rates or pricing for rigs on term was similar. I think it was maybe a couple of percentage points higher than the average spot pricing at that point. So those are some data points for consideration. And of course, now again -- I just want to make sure I clarify it -- the term day rates or average pricing that we saw at the peak last year has come down slightly temporarily and we expect it to come back up, as I mentioned in the previous answer, right?"

And again, I think we're in as good a position as anyone to be able to manage that as effectively as possible with the fleet that we have, the size that we have and the fleet uniformity. But the fact is -- and you've probably heard me say this before. But the fact is the rigs are working harder and harder because they're drilling longer laterals at higher pump pressures and there's just more -- the rigs are drilling faster wells, faster well cycle times.

At the time of our last call in July, the industry rig count was nearing the low levels reached during the 2009 recession, and we were witnessing a second round of declining oil prices and increased volatility. The question on everyone's mind then was are banks going to get worse from here. We know that the fundamentals have continued to deteriorate and today, U.S. land drilling activity is at the lowest level since January of 2003. For many, the major theme across the industry is survival. Service pricing continues to decline and this has led to sharp reductions in personnel, expenses and investments across-the-board.
While no company's immune to these conditions, fortunately, a cornerstone of our strategy has always been fiscal conservatism. Our strong balance sheet and long-term contract coverage continues to serve us well.
We also believe our advanced rig fleet, strong customer base and best-in-class reputation for customer service and value creation position us very well in this difficult environment. In many respects, this downturn has been indiscriminate of rig quality as evidenced by the number of Tier 1 rigs on the sideline. Even with some of the best rigs idle, there is still evidence the replacement cycle is ongoing.
A year ago, approximately 41% of the active rigs were AC drive. And today, approximately 58% of the active rigs in the U.S. are AC drive rigs, with the remaining 42% of the active rigs made up of a legacy fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs that continue to be less relevant as the cycle wears on.
H&P's fleet profile is a competitive advantage as it allows the company to provide a family of solutions for customers. We provide FlexRigs that are suited for a wide range of well configurations and well complexities for customers today. Perhaps more importantly, we believe our fleet provides what customer will need in the future. We have over 340 AC drive rigs in the U.S. market, including more than 310 FlexRigs rated at 1,500 horsepower, the optimal horsepower for the more difficult and complex horizontal extended reach laterals may drill today.
Over 180 FlexRigs are pad capable for multi-well locations and many of those rigs have additional capability, like 7,500 psi pump systems. Our ability to design and build means that any FlexRig in our fleet is a candidate to an upgrade to meet the customer's needs. We have a long history of innovating during down cycles and having customers reward those efforts as conditions improve. That commitment to design and innovation continues to be a focus in this difficult downturn.
Another competitive advantage is the organizational infrastructure that we have built over the past 10 years. This infrastructure allows us to leverage the learnings we capture from the fleet and to partner with customers to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety, all aimed at drilling the lowest cost well for that customer and maximizing the number of wells they can deliver in a budget year.
We've extended these advantages to international markets and will continue to push to expand our footprint. In short, we believe that our people, our fleet profile and our systems are unmatched in the industry.
To summarize, we are in the midst of very challenging market. Our efforts will remain focused on adding shareholder value by prudently allocating capital to provide innovative solutions that help our customers reduce their total cost and be more competitive in the global market.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."

The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%. But the decline is closer to 50% when we compare",1731,"Thank you, John. The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%. But the decline is closer to 50% when we compare this fourth fiscal quarter for fiscal '15 that is with last year's fourth fiscal quarter. This, of course, is the result of a market environment that, as John mentioned, presents serious challenges in terms of generating earnings for our shareholders, as reflected in our fourth fiscal quarter results.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $64 million in segment operating income during the fourth fiscal quarter, excluding abandonment charges related to old SCR rigs. The number of quarterly revenue base declined by a little over 5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 147 rigs generating revenue days[ph] during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 118 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 29 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly decreased to $26,218[ph] in the fourth fiscal quarter, and the average rig expense per day decreased to $13,823, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,395 in the fourth fiscal quarter. The decline in average rig revenue per day was again attributable to softer market conditions. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of a reducing volume of rigs becoming idle and requiring attention as compared to the prior quarter.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $33 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate about $13 million during the first fiscal quarter, about $45 million during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016 and over $10 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Since November of last year, and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contracts as to prior written notice to us, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 60 rigs under long-term contracts in this segment.
Total early termination revenues related to this 60 contracts are now estimated at over $270 million, approximately $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $123 million during fiscal 2016 and $62 million after that.
As of today, our 344 available rigs in the U.S. line segment includes approximately 132 rigs generating revenue and 212 idle rigs. Included in the 132 rigs generating revenue are 108[ph] rigs under term contracts, 104 of which are generating revenue base. In addition, 24 rigs are currently active in this spot market for a total of 128 rigs generating revenue days in the segment.
Some rigs that generate revenue days are in standby type day rates. Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 4 newbuild rigs with deliveries would have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 11% to 14% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to slightly decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to also declined to roughly $13,600.
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received the early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Let me repeat that, 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter and an average of about 102 rigs and 77 rigs during all of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
Some of the mutually beneficial negotiations of long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced levels have now transitioned back to those fully priced levels. As a result, the average pricing for rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing for H&P rigs in the soft market declined by approximately 5% from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and is expected to continue to at least slightly decline during the first fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $12 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days slightly increased but the average rig margin per day declined from $14,265 to $13,296 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $9,500 during the quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is primarily attributable to most rigs not performing operations and simply generating low relatively low margins under standby type day rates.
Management contracts on platform rates continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. The contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately $7 million, but that is now expected to decline to approximately $3 million during the following quarters given that customers suspended a couple of projects.
Moving on to our international land operations. The segment experienced a significant operating loss of $38 million during the fourth fiscal quarter primarily as a result of noncash impairment charges of approximately $39 million related to several conventional land rigs and approximately $5 million in charges related to an allowance for doubtful accounts associated with customers that we are no longer working for. These charges were partly offset by early contract termination compensation of approximately $9 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $4,658 per day and $5,535 per day corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the third and fourth quarters, respectively, as well as the impact of $3,021 per day corresponding to charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $13,086 to $7,856[ph] per day. The decline, as expected, was influenced by expenses corresponding to several rigs that became idle and to 2 rigs that were demobilized out of Tunisia. The decline was also attributable to day rate adjustments for 2 active rigs that rolled off long-term contracts.
Revenue days sequentially decreased by approximately 12% to an average of about 18 active rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 16 active rigs, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 14 of the 16 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 22 rigs are idle, including 8 in Argentina, 7 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador in 2 in Bahrain.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down with an average of approximately 15 rigs active during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to slightly increase to close to $8,000 per day and no early termination revenues are expected during the first fiscal quarter in the segment.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position remains very strong and we expect no change to our regular dividend dollar per share levels in the foreseeable future. We reported capital expenditures of slightly over $1.1 billion for fiscal 2015, well below our $1.3 billion estimate for the year. Although almost half of the reductions relate to timing differences of spending that moved to fiscal 2016, we were pleased to see the effect of several capital preservation initiatives result in reduced spending during fiscal 2015. Including the spending that moved to from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Roughly 70% to 80% of this spending estimate includes the remaining commitments related to our newbuild program and other special projects mostly related to the further enhancement of our existing fleet. The remaining 20% to 30% of the spending estimate is related to maintenance CapEx and other miscellaneous items.
Our FlexRigs reconstruction payments plan remains generally the same with 6 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. As has been the case with over 330 new AC drive FlexRigs, on average, over the last decade or so, every new rigs that we are scheduled to complete and is sponsored with a 3-year term contract that is expected to generate an after-tax payback of close to 90% during the duration of the contracted term. Including these remaining contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of 118 rigs under term contracts to be active in fiscal 2016, 93 in fiscal 2017 and 52 in fiscal 2018.
Given the soft market conditions and as mentioned early termination of long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, to approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. We expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and on general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $25 million for fiscal 2016.
The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 36.6%, which was higher than originally expected as a result of adjustments mostly related to foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately 36%.
Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2015, was slightly under $1.3 billion, which is lower than previously expected as a result of noncash adjustments related to abandonment and impairment charges and to the lower market pricing of our holdings of investment securities. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

And so I think our expectation would be going forward as you're going to continue to see the legacy fleet being replaced by AC drive rigs and, obviously, our FlexRigs, and we're going to see that happen over time. You heard us say this over and over for several years and that is, these rigs are working harder than they ever have, they're delivering at a higher level of performance than rigs ever have, the cycle times are increasing dramatically. And that puts a lot of pressure on that older legacy of the design. And so again I think over time that will happen. The question will be what about the pricing. Well, we've heard this for years. There's a level, you can't traduced the day rate low enough on that older legacy fleet in many cases to be able to save money for the customer. I mean, at the end of the day, it ends up costing the customer to go with that older rig fleet. So I think over time, we're going to continue to see the replacement cycle playout kind of like what we described in these it back over the last 5 years, you can see it happening."

So just one of the question and just relates to Juan Pablo's mention that there are few cases where you have agreed to lower that day rate on the term contract in exchange for an extension of the contract, sort of like the blend and extend deals we hear more frequently offshore contractors. But then I thought I heard you say that some of those deals then reverted back to the original contract. And I guess, my question is, is that kind of deal common? Or because you have seems that by far the majority of cases where E&P companies just want to buy out the remaining term of the contract?"

But what you referred to blend-and-extend type contract, what that typically implies is that the contractor reduces the day rate or the pricing in exchange of increasing the duration of the contract. That is not the case in terms of what we refer to. What happens in the type of deals that we referred to is that, there is a period of time for which a customer can get a slightly lower day rate. But then after that, the day rate goes back to the original day rate contemplated in a contract, and the duration once again, begins to take into account. In other words, if you have a 2-year term remaining, 2 out of 3 years remaining and you have a 6-month period where you have lower day rates, then the 2 years that remained moved to the right. And once you get to the point where the customer is ready to go back to the higher day rate, then, which is in the short period term in general, then the day rate goes back to the original price, so at the higher price. So we thought that, that was a mutually beneficial type of arrangement. It is not necessarily very, but we do all that we can to work with our customers."

So we can't provide you a reference there. What we do have, of course, is significant number of long-term contracts that ensure that we will get a very strong base in terms of cash from operations. And then from that, we think that we'll be able to fund at the CapEx level that we commented on and the current dividend level. We also have, of course, as you know, a very high level of cash and liquidity in general. If there were to be a negative cash flow position in any of the following years, we would certainly look at that existing cash at the beginning of the year to fund whatever may be pending or maybe the difference is.

And thank you for joining us on the call this morning.At the time of our last call in July, the industry rig count was nearing the low levels reached during the 2009 recession, and we were witnessing a",604,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call this morning.
At the time of our last call in July, the industry rig count was nearing the low levels reached during the 2009 recession, and we were witnessing a second round of declining oil prices and increased volatility. The question on everyone's mind then was are banks going to get worse from here? We know that the fundamentals have continued to deteriorate. And today, U.S. land drilling activity is at the lowest level since January of 2003. For many, the major theme across the industry is survival. Service pricing continues to decline and this has led to sharp reductions in personnel, expenses and investments across-the-board.
While no company's immune to these conditions, fortunately, a cornerstone of our strategy has always been fiscal conservatism. Our strong balance sheet and long-term contract coverage continues to serve us well.
We also believe our advanced rig fleet, strong customer base and best-in-class reputation for customer service and value creation position us very well in this difficult environment. In many respects, this downturn has been indiscriminate of rig quality as evidenced by the number of Tier 1 rigs on the sideline. Even with some of the best rigs idle, there is still evidence the replacement cycle is ongoing.
A year ago, approximately 41% of the active rigs were AC drive. And today, approximately 58% of the active rigs in the U.S. are AC drive rigs, with the remaining 42% of the active rigs made up of a legacy fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs that continue to be less relevant as the cycle wears on.
H&P's fleet profile is a competitive advantage as it allows the company to provide a family of solutions for customers. We provide FlexRigs that are suited for a wide range of well configurations and well complexities for customers today. Perhaps more importantly, we believe our fleet provides what customer will need in the future. We have over 340 AC drive rigs in the U.S. market, including more than 310 FlexRigs rated at 1,500 horsepower, the optimal horsepower for the more difficult and complex horizontal extended reach laterals being drill today.
Over 180 FlexRigs are pad capable for multi-well locations and many of those rigs have additional capability, like 7,500 psi pump systems. Our ability to design and build means that any FlexRig in our fleet is a candidate for an upgrade to meet the customer's needs. We have a long history of innovating during down cycles and having customers reward those efforts as conditions improve. That commitment to design and innovation continues to be a focus in this difficult downturn.
Another competitive advantage is the organizational infrastructure that we have built over the past 10 years. This infrastructure allows us to leverage the learnings we capture from the fleet and to partner with customers to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety, all aimed at drilling the lowest cost well for that customer and maximizing the number of wells they can deliver in a budget year.
We've extended these advantages to international markets and will continue to push to expand our footprint. In short, we believe that our people, our fleet profile and our systems are unmatched in the industry.
To summarize, we are in the midst of a very challenging market. Our efforts will remain focused on adding shareholder value by prudently allocating capital to provide innovative solutions that help our customers reduce their total cost and be more competitive in the global market.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."

The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%. But the decline is closer to 50% when we compare",1728,"Thank you, John. The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%. But the decline is closer to 50% when we compare this fourth fiscal quarter -- or fiscal '15, that is, with last year's fourth fiscal quarter. This, of course, is a result of a market environment that, as John mentioned, presents serious challenges in terms of generating earnings for our shareholders, as reflected in our fourth fiscal quarter results.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $64 million in segment operating income during the fourth fiscal quarter, excluding abandonment charges related to old SCR rigs. The number of quarterly revenue base declined by a little over 5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 147 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 118 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 29 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly decreased to $26,218 in the fourth fiscal quarter, and the average rig expense per day decreased to $13,823, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,395 in the fourth fiscal quarter. The decline in average rig revenue per day was again attributable to softer market conditions. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of a reducing volume of rigs becoming idle and requiring attention as compared to the prior quarter.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $33 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contract. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate about $13 million during the first fiscal quarter, about $45 million during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 and over $10 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Since November of last year, and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contracts, as per prior written notice to us, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 60 rigs under long-term contracts in this segment.
Total early termination revenues related to these 60 contracts are now estimated at over $270 million, approximately $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $123 million during fiscal 2016 and $62 million after that.
As of today, our 344 available rigs in the U.S. land segment includes approximately 132 rigs generating revenue and 212 idle rigs. Included in the 132 rigs generating revenue are 108 rigs under term contracts, 104 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 24 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 128 rigs generating revenue days in the segment.
Some rigs that generate revenue days are in standby type day rates. Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 4 newbuild rigs with deliveries would have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 11% to 14% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to slightly decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to also decline to roughly $13,600.
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received the early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Let me repeat that, 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter and an average of about 102 rigs and 77 rigs during all of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
Some of the mutually beneficial negotiations of long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced levels have now transitioned back to those fully priced levels. As a result, the average pricing for rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing for H&P rigs in the soft market declined by approximately 5% from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to at least slightly decline during the first fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $12 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days slightly increased, but the average rig margin per day declined from $14,265 to $13,296 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $9,500 during the quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is primarily attributable to most rigs not performing operations and simply generating relatively low margins under standby-type day rates.
Management contracts on platform rates continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. The contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately $7 million, but that is now expected to decline to approximately $3 million during the following quarters, given that customers suspended a couple of projects.
Moving on to our international land operations. The segment experienced a significant operating loss of $38 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of noncash impairment charges of approximately $39 million related to several conventional land rigs and approximately $5 million in charges related to an allowance for doubtful accounts associated with customers that we are no longer working for. These charges were partly offset by early contract termination compensation of approximately $9 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $4,658 per day and $5,535 per day corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the third and fourth quarters, respectively, as well as the impact of $3,021 per day corresponding to charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $13,086 to $7,856 per day. The decline, as expected, was influenced by expenses corresponding to several rigs that became idle and to 2 rigs that were demobilized out of Tunisia. The decline was also attributable to day rate adjustments for 2 active rigs that rolled off long-term contracts.
Revenue days sequentially decreased by approximately 12% to an average of about 18 active rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 16 active rigs, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 14 of the 16 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 22 rigs are idle, including 8 in Argentina, 7 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador and 2 in Bahrain.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down with an average of approximately 15 rigs active during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to slightly increase to close to $8,000 per day and no early termination revenues are expected during the first fiscal quarter in the segment.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position remains very strong and we expect no change to our regular dividend dollar per share levels in the foreseeable future. We reported capital expenditures of slightly over $1.1 billion for fiscal 2015, well below our $1.3 billion estimate for the year. Although almost half of the reductions relate to timing differences of spending that moved to fiscal 2016, we were pleased to see the effect of several capital preservation initiatives result in reduced spending during fiscal 2015. Including the spending that moved from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Roughly 70% to 80% of this spending estimate includes the remaining commitments related to our newbuild program and other special projects mostly related to the further enhancement of our existing fleet. The remaining 20% to 30% of the spending estimate is related to maintenance CapEx and other miscellaneous items.
Our FlexRigs construction cadence plan remains generally the same, with 6 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. As has been the case with over 330 new AC drive FlexRigs, on average, over the last decade or so, every new rig that we are scheduled to complete is sponsored with a 3-year term contract that is expected to generate an after-tax payback of close to 90% during the duration of the contracted term. Including these remaining contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of 118 rigs under term contracts to be active in fiscal 2016, 93 in fiscal 2017 and 52 in fiscal 2018.
Given the soft market conditions and the mentioned early termination of long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, to approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. We expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $25 million for fiscal 2016.
The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 36.6%, which was higher than originally expected as a result of adjustments mostly related to foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately 36%.
Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2015, was slightly under $1.3 billion, which is lower than previously expected as a result of noncash adjustments related to abandonment and impairment charges and to the lower market pricing of our holdings of investment securities. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

I think a portion of those legacy fleet that's working, of course, we don't have any rigs in that category, so we don't know the contractual situation. But our assumption is there's a portion of those rigs that are under term contract. And so I think over time, we could probably expect to see some of those rigs rolloff. And so I think our expectation would be going forward as you're going to continue to see the legacy fleet being replaced by AC drive rigs. And obviously, our vote would be FlexRigs, and we're going to see that happen over time. You heard us say this over and over for several years, and that is these rigs are working harder than they ever have. They're delivering at a higher level of performance than rigs ever have. The cycle times are increasing dramatically. And that puts a lot of pressure on that older legacy fleet design. And so again, I think over time, that will happen. The question will be what about the pricing? Well, we've heard this for years. There's a level you can't reduce the day rate low enough on that older legacy fleet, in many cases, to be able to save money for the customer. I mean, at the end of the day, it ends up costing the customer to go with that older rig fleet. So I think over time, we're going to continue to see the replacement cycle play out kind of like what we've described. And you look back over the last 5 years, you can see it happening."

But what you refer to as blend-and-extend type contract, what that typically implies is that the contractor reduces the day rate or the pricing in exchange of increasing the duration of the contract. That is not the case in terms of what we refer to. What happens and the type of deals that we referred to is that there is a period of time for which a customer can get a slightly lower day rate. But then after that, the day rate goes back to the original day rate contemplated in a contract and the duration, once again, begins to take into account. In other words, if you have a 2-year term remaining, 2 out of 3 years remaining and you have a 6-month period where you have lower day rates, then the 2 years that remain moved to the right. And once you get to the point where the customer is ready to go back to a higher day rate then, which is in a short term in general, then the day rate goes back to the original price, so at the higher price. So we thought that, that was a mutually beneficial type of arrangement. It's not necessarily very, but we do all that we can to work with our customers."

But clearly, it's -- when you start looking at, as an example, a 7 or an 8-day well compared to a 25-day well, the opportunity set, obviously, gets a little smaller every year."

And thank you for joining us on the call this morning.At the time of our last call in July, the industry rig count was nearing the low levels reached during the 2009 recession, and we were witnessing a",605,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call this morning.
At the time of our last call in July, the industry rig count was nearing the low levels reached during the 2009 recession, and we were witnessing a second round of declining oil prices and increased volatility. The question on everyone's mind then was are things going to get worse from here? We know that the fundamentals have continued to deteriorate. And today, U.S. land drilling activity is at the lowest level since January of 2003. For many, the major theme across the industry is survival. Service pricing continues to decline and this has led to sharp reductions in personnel, expenses and investments across-the-board.
While no company is immune to these conditions, fortunately, a cornerstone of our strategy has always been fiscal conservatism. Our strong balance sheet and long-term contract coverage continues to serve us well.
We also believe our advanced rig fleet, strong customer base and best-in-class reputation for customer service and value creation position us very well in this difficult environment. In many respects, this downturn has been indiscriminate of rig quality as evidenced by the number of Tier 1 rigs on the sideline. Even with some of the best rigs idle, there is still evidence the replacement cycle is ongoing.
A year ago, approximately 41% of the active rigs were AC drive. And today, approximately 58% of the active rigs in the U.S. are AC drive rigs, with the remaining 42% of the active rigs made up of a legacy fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs that continue to be less relevant as the cycle wears on.
H&P's fleet profile is a competitive advantage as it allows the company to provide a family of solutions for customers. We provide FlexRigs that are suited for a wide range of well configurations and well complexities for customers today. Perhaps more importantly, we believe our fleet provides what customers will need in the future. We have over 340 AC drive rigs in the U.S. market, including more than 310 FlexRigs rated at 1,500 horsepower, the optimal horsepower for the more difficult and complex horizontal extended reach laterals being drilled today.
Over 180 FlexRigs are pad capable for multi-well locations and many of those rigs have additional capability, like 7,500 psi pump systems. Our ability to design and build means that any FlexRig in our fleet is a candidate for an upgrade to meet a customer's needs. We have a long history of innovating during down cycles and having customers reward those efforts as conditions improve. That commitment to design and innovation continues to be a focus in this difficult downturn.
Another competitive advantage is the organizational infrastructure that we have built over the past 10 years. This infrastructure allows us to leverage the learnings we capture from the fleet and to partner with customers to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety, all aimed at drilling the lowest cost well for that customer and maximizing the number of wells they can deliver in a budget year.
We've extended these advantages to international markets and will continue to push to expand our footprint. In short, we believe that our people, our fleet profile and our systems are unmatched in the industry.
To summarize, we are in the midst of a very challenging market. Our efforts will remain focused on adding shareholder value by prudently allocating capital to provide innovative solutions that help our customers reduce their total cost and be more competitive in the global market.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."

The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%. But the decline is closer to 50% when we compare",1728,"Thank you, John. The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%. But the decline is closer to 50% when we compare this fourth fiscal quarter -- or fiscal '15, that is, with last year's fourth fiscal quarter. This, of course, is a result of a market environment that, as John mentioned, presents serious challenges in terms of generating earnings for our shareholders, as reflected in our fourth fiscal quarter results.
Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $64 million in segment operating income during the fourth fiscal quarter, excluding abandonment charges related to old SCR rigs. The number of quarterly revenue base declined by a little over 5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 147 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 118 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 29 rigs worked in the spot market.
Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly decreased to $26,218 in the fourth fiscal quarter, and the average rig expense per day decreased to $13,823, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,395 in the fourth fiscal quarter. The decline in average rig revenue per day was again attributable to softer market conditions. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of a reducing volume of rigs becoming idle and requiring attention as compared to the prior quarter.
During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $33 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contract. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate about $13 million during the first fiscal quarter, about $45 million during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2016 and over $10 million thereafter in early termination revenues. Since November of last year, and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contracts, as per prior written notice to us, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 60 rigs under long-term contracts in this segment.
Total early termination revenues related to these 60 contracts are now estimated at over $270 million, approximately $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $123 million during fiscal 2016 and $62 million after that.
As of today, our 344 available rigs in the U.S. land segment includes approximately 132 rigs generating revenue and 212 idle rigs. Included in the 132 rigs generating revenue are 108 rigs under term contracts, 104 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 24 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 128 rigs generating revenue days in the segment.
Some rigs that generate revenue days are in standby type day rates. Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include 4 newbuild rigs with deliveries would have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 11% to 14% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to slightly decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to also decline to roughly $13,600.
Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received the early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Let me repeat that, 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter and an average of about 102 rigs and 77 rigs during all of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
Some of the mutually beneficial negotiations of long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully priced levels have now transitioned back to those fully priced levels. As a result, the average pricing for rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and newbuilds are deployed.
The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to at least slightly decline during the first fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.
Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $12 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days slightly increased, but the average rig margin per day declined from $14,265 to $13,296 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter. As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $9,500 during the quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is primarily attributable to most rigs not performing operations and simply generating relatively low margins under standby-type day rates.
Management contracts on platform rates continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. The contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately $7 million, but that is now expected to decline to approximately $3 million during the following quarters, given that customers suspended a couple of projects.
Moving on to our international land operations. The segment experienced a significant operating loss of $38 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of noncash impairment charges of approximately $39 million related to several conventional land rigs and approximately $5 million in charges related to an allowance for doubtful accounts associated with customers that we are no longer working for. These charges were partly offset by early contract termination compensation of approximately $9 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $4,658 per day and $5,535 per day corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the third and fourth quarters, respectively, as well as the impact of $3,021 per day corresponding to charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $13,086 to $7,856 per day. The decline, as expected, was influenced by expenses corresponding to several rigs that became idle and to 2 rigs that were demobilized out of Tunisia. The decline was also attributable to day rate adjustments for 2 active rigs that rolled off long-term contracts.
Revenue days sequentially decreased by approximately 12% to an average of about 18 active rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 16 active rigs, including 11 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 14 of the 16 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 22 rigs are idle, including 8 in Argentina, 7 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador and 2 in Bahrain.
We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down with an average of approximately 15 rigs active during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to slightly increase to close to $8,000 per day and no early termination revenues are expected during the first fiscal quarter in the segment.
Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position remains very strong, and we expect no change to our regular dividend dollar per share levels in the foreseeable future. We reported capital expenditures of slightly over $1.1 billion for fiscal 2015, well below our $1.3 billion estimate for the year. Although almost half of the reductions relate to timing differences of spending that moved to fiscal 2016, we were pleased to see the effect of several capital preservation initiatives result in reduced spending during fiscal 2015. Including the spending that moved from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Roughly 70% to 80% of this spending estimate includes the remaining commitments related to our newbuild program and other special projects mostly related to the further enhancement of our existing fleet. The remaining 20% to 30% of the spending estimate is related to maintenance CapEx and other miscellaneous items.
Our FlexRigs construction cadence plan remains generally the same, with 6 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. As has been the case with over 330 new AC drive FlexRigs, on average, over the last decade or so, every new rig that we are scheduled to complete is sponsored with a 3-year term contract that is expected to generate an after-tax payback of close to 90% during the duration of the contracted term. Including these remaining contracts and combining all 3 of our drilling segments, we have an average of 118 rigs under term contracts to be active in fiscal 2016, 93 in fiscal 2017 and 52 in fiscal 2018.
Given the soft market conditions and the mentioned early termination of long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, to approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. We expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $25 million for fiscal 2016.
The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 36.6%, which was higher than originally expected as a result of adjustments mostly related to foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately 36%.
Our noncurrent deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2015, was slightly under $1.3 billion, which is lower than previously expected as a result of noncash adjustments related to abandonment and impairment charges and to the lower market pricing of our holdings of investment securities. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.
With that, let me turn the call back to John."

I think a portion of those legacy fleet that's working, of course, we don't have any rigs in that category, so we don't know the contractual situation. But our assumption is there's a portion of those rigs that are under term contract. And so I think over time, we could probably expect to see some of those rigs roll off. And so I think our expectation would be going forward as you're going to continue to see the legacy fleet being replaced by AC drive rigs. And obviously, our vote would be FlexRigs, and we're going to see that happen over time. You heard us say this over and over for several years, and that is these rigs are working harder than they ever have. They're delivering at a higher level of performance than rigs ever have. The cycle times are increasing dramatically. And that puts a lot of pressure on that older legacy fleet design. And so again, I think over time, that will happen. The question will be what about the pricing? Well -- but we've heard this for years. There's a level you can't reduce the day rate low enough on that older legacy fleet, in many cases, to be able to save money for the customer. I mean, at the end of the day, it ends up costing the customer to go with that older rig fleet. So I think over time, we're going to continue to see the replacement cycle play out, kind of like what we've described. And if you look back over the last 5 years, you can see it happening."

So just one of the question and it just relates to Juan Pablo's mention that there are a few cases where you have agreed to lower the day rate on a term contract in exchange for an extension of the contract, sort of like the blend and extend deals we hear more frequently offshore contractors. But then I thought I heard you say that some of those deals then reverted back to the original contract. And I guess my question is, is that kind of deal common? Or because you have -- it seems that by far the majority of cases were E&P -- the E&P companies just want to buy out the remaining term of the contract?"

But what you refer to as blend-and-extend type contract, what that typically implies is that the contractor reduces the day rate or the pricing in exchange of increasing the duration of the contract. That is not the case in terms of what we refer to. What happens in the type of deals that we referred to is that there is a period of time for which a customer can get a slightly lower day rate. But then after that, the day rate goes back to the original day rate contemplated in a contract and the duration, once again, begins to take into account. In other words, if you have a 2-year term remaining, or 2 out of 3 years remaining and you have a 6-month period where you have lower day rates, then the 2 years that remain move to the right. And once you get to the point where the customer is ready to go back to a higher day rate then, which is in a shorter term in general, then the day rate goes back to the original price, so at the higher price. So we thought that, that was a mutually beneficial type of arrangement. It's not necessarily very common, but we do all that we can to work with our customers."

Or is your gaining factor CapEx, if you just kind of see what I'm saying? Are you going to reduce CapEx to maintain a positive free cash flow position? Or are you going to need to tap a debt market or whatever to keep paying out your dividend? How are you guys thinking about that tactically?"

We would not expect to borrow money in order to pay dividends. If we were to borrow money in the future, it'd probably will be to pursue opportunities to expand the business, it would probably be business related. But to the first part of your question, the amount of cash flow that we will be able to generate will depend on market conditions. And of course, we don't provide guidance in that regard, so we can't provide you a reference there. What we do have, of course, is the significant number of long-term contracts that ensure that we will get a very strong base in terms of cash from operations. And then from that, we think that we'll be able to fund at the CapEx level that we commented on and the current dividend level. We also have, of course, as you know, a very high level of cash and liquidity in general. If there were to be a negative cash flow position in any of the following years, we would certainly look at that existing cash at the beginning of the year to fund whatever may be pending or may be the difference there. So hopefully, that helps to answer your question."

I don't get the sense that operators, at least our customers in general, there's not this continual request for a reduction in day rate because of, I think, number one, we're working together very well, we're delivering a lot of value. The cost of their wells continue to come down. I mean, you just look across the board in the E&P space, and that's a pretty common thing that well costs are coming down. So I just think it's not something that's out there being talked about, because we're really not out there bidding much in the spot market. I don't get a sense that there's going to be this huge push to continue to reduce pricing. But that we're making an assumption that the market looks like it is now and that oil prices are in the $40 range and something crazy doesn't happen and prices go lower, I'm not expecting that. But in that event, maybe you would see some additional pricing pressure. But that's about as clear as we can make it right now, Kurt. We just really don't have any more visibility on that based on what we see right now."
