With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, we were pleased to complete the transformational year in 2014 for Martin Marietta, culminating with a 77% increase in fourth-quarter net earnings over the prior year quarter. Our results reflect growth in the heritage Aggregates business, the expanding contribution from the acquired TXI operations and the consistently strong performance by our magnesia specialties business. Additionally, we also announced a $20 million share repurchase program on which I'll further elaborate later in the teleconference.
In addition to earnings growth, we were pleased to announce positive developments related to TXI synergies. First, we exceeded our previously announced guidance for 2014 by 53% or nearly $10 million. Second, based on our integration progress to date, we now expect to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016, more than 40% over our previous guidance. This rate of synergy realization made the TXI acquisition modestly accretive to 2014 earnings, excluding, of course, the onetime costs related to the transaction. This accretion should continue into 2015 and beyond based on incremental synergy realization, coupled with continued growth in the underlying business. These developments confirm our ability to deliver on our objectives and create additional shareholder value.
Before further discussing the quarterly and full year results, as a reminder, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
To continue to provide transparency into our fourth quarter results, we will again discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations. To facilitate this discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that is consistent with how management analyzes the business.
First, as detailed on Slide 2, the heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes magnesia specialties, provides a same-on-same comparison to the prior fourth year quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally, on Slide 7, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better understand the drivers of our performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage Aggregates business. We're pleased to report volume growth in all product lines and in all reportable groups within the Aggregates product line. Additionally, pricing strength was notable in both aggregates and ready mixed concrete product lines. Consistent with trends seen throughout 2014, fourth quarter Aggregates business growth was led by robust activity in our West Group, primarily in Texas and Colorado. Texas continues to benefit from a strong state Department of Transportation. With a cumulative budget of $20 billion over fiscal years 2013 to 2015, Texas has created a sizable project backlog. This public work is naturally separate and distinct from a very healthy private sector in Texas. Thus, while the aggregates product line shipment increase in the West Group was approximately 8.5%, the same-on-same comparison reflects growth of more than 15%. This comparison excludes shipments in the prior year quarter from the North Troy quarry in Oklahoma and 2 rail yards in the Dallas area, which were divested in the third quarter of 2014. This transaction was actually the only required divestiture for the approval of the TXI acquisition by the United States Department of Justice in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino review.
North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all ranked in the top 5 states for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Consistent with this trend, recovery in the construction market is under way in the Eastern half of the country, although currently lagging the West. Heritage aggregates product line volumes in the Mid-America Group, which increased 7.7%, reflects growth throughout North Carolina. The Southeast Group benefited from activity -- increased activity in Florida, where the TIFIA-funded I-4 project is beginning and the housing market is also improving.
Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets. The infrastructure market represented 44% of quarterly volumes and, shipments to this sector increased 12%. This growth reflects double-digit improvement in each reportable group and notably was achieved while the federal transportation funding is being provided under a continuing resolution through May 31. During this time, we have seen increasing momentum for multiyear federal highway bill. The executive and congressional branches of government each recognize the need to invest in the country's aging and deficient infrastructure. Despite bipartisan support for a new bill, the main area of debate continues to be the funding source.
Nonresidential end-use market represented 32% of quarterly heritage volumes, and shipments increased 4% over the prior year quarter. Growth was achieved in the commercial and energy sectors. While declining oil prices caused concern about the sustainability of energy-related projects, we don't expect a significant impact on our business based on both the backlog and the momentum of committed projects as well as $100 billion of anticipated projects along the Gulf Coast, a significant portion of which are in Texas.
Additionally, late last year, Texas voters approved Proposition 1, which authorizes annual disbursements from the state's existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund. An estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred this fiscal year alone.
The residential end-use market represented 15% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes, and shipments increased 5% over the prior year quarter. We continue to experience significant residential construction growth in our Western markets. By way of example, through the 12 months ending December 31, 2014, residential starts rose 33% in San Antonio, 10% in Houston and 37% in Austin. This reaffirms our view of the value of the company's strategic growth initiatives made over the last several years, which should continue to benefit our future demand.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets, ChemRock and Rail represented the remaining 9% of our heritage aggregates product line volume and shipments, increasing 5% versus the prior year quarter. This growth reflects an increase in ballast shipments, partially offset by a slowdown in agricultural line shipments.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing remains strong, and we are pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Pricing increased 6% over the prior year quarter, led by 9% increase in the West Group. For the full year, heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 4%, in line with our guidance.
Aggregates product line cost per ton shipped declined 2% compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction reflects increased operating leverage and an 11% decline in energy costs, driven by lower oil prices.
The heritage aggregates related downstream product lines increased their total gross profit $5 million. The ready mixed concrete product line experienced pricing and volume increases of 11% and 2%, respectively, which led to an 840 basis point increase in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported a 16% increase in its net sales.
Gross profit for the heritage Aggregates business increased $27 million and was 21.7% of net sales, an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior quarter. Notably, the heritage ready mixed concrete business gross margin expanded 570 points. These are primarily the operations acquired in the Denver market at the end of 2011, which have demonstrated steady improvement since the acquisition. We expect the similar trend in the acquired TXI ready-mix business.
Our Specialty Products business posted record fourth quarter net sales of $58.2 million and a gross margin of 39%, contributing earnings from operations of $19.8 million.
Slides 4 through 6 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the fourth quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $31 million and shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.13 per ton, helped by increased rail distribution yard and sand and gravel shipments. Performance in the Aggregates business should improve at an accelerated pace given the strength of underlying market demand and synergy realization. 
The acquired ready mixed concrete business shipped 1.3 million cubic yards during the quarter with an average selling price of $82.74. In the Southwest, fourth quarter selling prices and production costs were typically lower than in the warmer months when temperature control measures are required during the production process. Such measures are passed on as additive pricing when incurred. A $6 per yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1. Full realization of the increase will likely take 6 months as we work through the current backlog.
As a reminder, the cement business includes a leading position in the Texas markets and a state-of-the-art rail-located cement plant in Southern California. The Texas plants continue to operate in markets where demand currently exceeds local available supply, a trend expected to continue for the near future. In the fourth quarter, we shipped 1 million tons of cement. Cement pricing of $93.02 per ton is $7.07 or 8.2% higher than third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the cement business generated $100 million of net sales and $28 million in gross profit. The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization and the California plant is operating at the low 70s percent utilization, reflective of a slower Southern California instruction economy recovery. We continue to anticipate California markets should reach a supply demand equilibrium during 2016. Our cement group leadership is implementing strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, plant utilization and efficiency, thereby creating a roadmap for significantly improved future profitability.
Our remaining key area of emphasis is to increase and accelerate the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. We are thus pleased to announce our revised expectations of $100 million of annual synergies by 2016. For the second half of 2014, we achieved synergies of nearly $28 million, 53% above our guidance. These results are not possible without the relentless and effective efforts of our workforce. I'm proud to thank and commend our employees for their stellar progress. We plan to complete the systems integration for the cement and ready mixed concrete businesses no later than June of this year. Accordingly, and as planned, certain duplicative corporate overhead costs will continue through that time.
As previously announced, we acquired over $500 million of TXI's net operating loss or NOL carryforwards. We used $48 million of these benefits to reduce our cash taxes to 17% of our income tax expense. We expect to utilize the remaining NOLs over the next 2 to 3 years.
For the fourth quarter, consolidated SG&A was 6.4% of net sales, a 120 basis point reduction compared with the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects both lower pension expense as well as net sales growth, which outpaced the increase in SG&A. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $1.7 million, which reflects our estimated quarterly run rate related to TXI going forward.
As detailed on Slide 7, our consolidated earnings from operations were $119 million. This compares to $63 million in the prior year quarter and represents an improvement of nearly 90%. For the full year, we generated $382 million of operating cash flow compared with $309 million for 2013. Importantly, though, excluding payments for acquisition-related expenses, adjusted operating cash flow was $452 million. This increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and less cash taxes, partially offset by cash utilized for working capital. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2014, was slightly less than 2.5x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our target as of year end.
Our ability to generate cash has provided us the opportunity to increase our return to shareholders in addition to the quarterly dividend. Consistent with this objective, this morning we announced a new share buyback program that includes authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. To provide context of this number, this represents nearly 30% of our outstanding shares as well as the number of shares issued on our July 1, 2014, acquisition of TXI. We expect to complete the program over 3 years. However, the actual timing will depend on available cash and the market price for our stock during the timeframe. Our balance sheet strength has allowed us to provide this return to our shareholders, while also continuing to invest in our business responsibly.
Moving to our 2015 guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets, both geographically, particularly in areas with strong employment gains and construction end-use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies, we expect growth in our 3 largest end-use markets, the infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. Residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase. And the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat.
Cumulatively, we expect Aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12%, with a 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 4% to 6% over 2014. Aggregates product line cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014.
The aggregates-related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million.
Magnesia specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6% despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension cost over 2014.
On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $825 million to $875 million. Interest should approximate $75 million to $80 million. And the estimated effective income tax rate is expected to be 32%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern highly efficient rail-connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas, including Houston, for generations.
To conclude, we're grateful to our shareholders for their support throughout an exciting and transformational year. The TXI acquisition strengthened and broadened our foundation, and we're well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for building materials and to continue delivering enhanced shareholder value.
Additionally, for those of you who registered, we look forward to seeing you at our investor and analyst day this week on Thursday, February 12, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. For those of you who cannot attend, the event will be webcast. And our website contains more details.

I guess 2 components in that. Number one, you have to remember, when we went into the transaction and closed it on July 1, because of the antitrust process, our operating teams have really only had about a couple of weeks with that business before we closed. So from a practical matter, their time on the ground and their time looking for what we find or what we term found synergies, was really pretty short. So what's happened is you're seeing really the result of having our teams and therefore more expanded period of time. That's what's really driven the accelerate of these synergies. So I'm not that surprised by it. I knew if we could get our good people on the ground they would capture those and we would see them quickly. And I do think they did a fantastic job with that. To the next part of your question, where are we in the innings. I think we're in the early innings of this game. Again, we've owned this business for a little bit over half a year. You're seeing that type of synergy realization that quickly. You have to assume that we, as a combined workforce, and that's what we are now, will continue to work very effectively to find more. And I think you should expect us to find more."

That was down about 350,000 tons for the quarter. We saw a pullback in the Eagle Ford. Oddly enough, or maybe not oddly enough, we saw Haynesville actually up. So what you're seeing is a little bit of a play on gas versus gas and oil, Kathryn. If we go back and look at the full year, it's around 7.5 million tons. You're just been dead on, on that. Most of that is going to either roads or pads or otherwise, but here's the take that we have on it. What we're seeing is a strong enough recovery in other areas of nonres that we think that's going to offset whatever bumps there may be in some elements of the product simply going to the different shale plays. So from where we're sitting, shale play has always been in non res all by itself, we're just seeing other portions of it, they're growing so rapidly. We think it's likely to offset that. But the other piece of it, Kathryn, though, that I think is important is the way energy has been moving, particularly in a state like Texas, to put some metrics to it, we use -- I want to say 17 million gallons of diesel fuel in the Southwest last year. So as we're watching oil prices come down and it affects some degree of volume going to, the answer is yes. Do I think it's going to be horribly dramatic? The answer to that is no. Do I think the cost benefit that we are likely to see from that is much better than the downside on the volume? The answer to that is absolutely."

And keep in mind, even the energy Carter road work that started last year, about $150 million worth of that work was let. So Texas would tell you they've got a 1 billion dollar issue there all by themselves. So my point is this, more and more of that work probably for the next 2 or 3 years, at least in Texas, will tend to be infrastructure-driven simply because that market is so immense right now."

Is that volume? been in more than anything? Is it synergy dependent more than anything? To the degree you can kind of flesh that out, that would be great."

I think the more powerful element of that really is when you're coming back and you're starting to see that Eastern United States perform a little bit better. I mean here's the way that you can think about it. We actually, for the full year, in the Mid-Atlantic Division, sold less tonnage in '14 than we sold in '13. Now we're seeing that market get much stronger going into '15, made more money in Mid-Atlantic on less tonnage in '14 than we did in '13. So our point is simply this, with that type of volume momentum now in those markets and with that type of performance in those markets, we feel like that can awfully be powerful to this business. And again, what we're seeing particularly in North Texas around infrastructure, we think is a great story. And again, to your point, we are seeing lower occupancy rates in nonres than we've seen in Dallas in close to a decade right now. So market, what we can do pricing in that market but, to your point, what we can do in aggregates, synergies in TXI and emerging strength in the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic group is performing more strongly, that's the key to it. That's the part of the country, as you know, Ted, that has been the slowest to come out of this. That's the part of the country that's the most disproportionately profitable for us, particularly in heritage aggregates when it's performing at a more normalized way."

The Florida program as you referenced is really very, very strong. I mean, it's the largest DOT budget in that state's history. One thing that's important about a state like Florida and I think it's a good model for the rest of the country, less than 30% of their DOT money actually originates from federal coffers, which gives that nice staying power all the way through. And of course Colorado, as we discussed, has a good DOT program, supplemented by their RAMP program, supplemented by a lot of FEMA spending in that market place right now. So you've got a series of markets in addition to what's going on in Texas that have actually done quite well as you recall. When we actually gave guidance last year at this same time, for 2014, we anticipated the infrastructure would be up, and I think really a lot of people had some skepticism about it at the time and we said very are really matters on these DOT programs and that's exactly what happened in '14.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, we were pleased to complete the transformational year in 2014 for Martin Marietta, culminating with a 77% increase in fourth quarter net earnings over the prior year quarter. Our results reflect growth in the heritage aggregates business, the expanding contribution from the acquired TXI operations and the consistently strong performance by our magnesia specialties business. Additionally, we also announced a 20 million share repurchase program on which I'll further elaborate later in the teleconference.
In addition to earnings growth, we were pleased to announce positive developments related to TXI synergies. First, we exceeded our previously announced guidance for 2014 by 53% or nearly $10 million. Second, based on our integration progress to date, we now expect to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016, more than 40% over our previous guidance. This rate of synergy realization made the TXI acquisition modestly accretive to 2014 earnings, excluding, of course, the onetime costs related to the transaction. This accretion should continue into 2015 and beyond based on incremental synergy realization, coupled with continued growth in the underlying business. These developments confirm our ability to deliver on our objectives and create additional shareholder value.
Before further discussing the quarterly and full year results, as a reminder, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
To continue to provide transparency into our fourth quarter results, we will again discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of acquired operations. To facilitate this discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that is consistent with how management analyzes the business.
First, as detailed on Slide 2, the heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes magnesia specialties, provides a same-on-same comparison to the prior fourth year quarter. Next, results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally, on Slide 7, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better understand the drivers of our performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report volume growth in all product lines and in all reportable groups within the aggregates product line. Additionally, pricing strength was notable in both aggregates and ready-mix concrete product lines. Consistent with trends seen throughout 2014, fourth quarter aggregates business growth was led by robust activity in our West Group, primarily in Texas and Colorado. Texas continues to benefit from a strong state Department of Transportation. With a cumulative budget of $20 billion over fiscal years 2013 to 2015, Texas has created a sizable project backlog. This public work is naturally separate and distinct from a very healthy private sector in Texas. Thus, while the aggregates product line shipment increase in the West Group was approximately 8.5%, the same-on-same comparison reflects growth of more than 15%. This comparison excludes shipments in the prior year quarter from the North Troy quarry in Oklahoma and 2 rail yards in the Dallas area, which were divested in the third quarter of 2014. This transaction was actually the only required divestiture for the approval of the TXI acquisition by the United States Department of Justice in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino review.
North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all ranked in the top 5 states for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Consistent with this trend, recovery in the construction market is under way in the Eastern half of the country, although currently lagging the West. Heritage aggregates product line volumes in the Mid-America Group, which increased 7.7%, reflects growth throughout North Carolina. The Southeast Group benefited from activity -- increased activity in Florida, where the TIFIA-funded I-4 project is beginning and the housing market is also improving.
Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets. The infrastructure market represented 44% of quarterly volumes and shipments to this sector increased 12%. This growth reflects double-digit improvement in each reportable group and notably was achieved while the federal transportation funding is being provided under a continuing resolution through May 31. During this time, we have seen increasing momentum for multiyear federal highway bill. The executive and congressional branches of government each recognize the need to invest in the country's aging and deficient infrastructure. Despite bipartisan support for a new bill, the main area of debate continues to be the funding source.
Nonresidential end-use market represented 32% of quarterly heritage volumes, and shipments increased 4% over the prior year quarter. Growth was achieved in the commercial and energy sectors. While declining oil prices cause concern about the sustainability of energy-related projects, we don't expect a significant impact on our business based on both the backlog and the momentum of committed projects as well as $100 billion of anticipated projects along the Gulf Coast, a significant portion of which are in Texas.
Additionally, late last year, Texas voters approved Proposition 1, which authorizes annual disbursements from the state's existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund. An estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred this fiscal year alone.
The residential end-use market represented 15% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes, and shipments increased 5% over the prior year quarter. We continue to experience significant residential construction growth in our Western markets. By way of example, through the 12 months ending December 31, 2014, residential starts rose 33% in San Antonio, 10% in Houston and 37% in Austin. This reaffirms our view of the value of the company's strategic growth initiatives made over the last several years, which should continue to benefit our future demand.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets, ChemRock and Rail represented the remaining 9% of our heritage aggregates product line volume and shipments, increasing 5% versus the prior year quarter. This growth reflects an increase in ballast shipments, partially offset by a slowdown in agricultural line shipments.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing remains strong, and we're pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Pricing increased 6% over the prior year quarter, led by 9% increase in the West Group. For the full year, heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 4%, in line with our guidance.
Aggregates product line cost per ton shipped declined 2% compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction reflects increased operating leverage and an 11% decline in energy costs, driven by lower oil prices.
The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their total gross profit $5 million. The ready-mix concrete product line experienced pricing and volume increases of 11% and 2%, respectively, which led to an 840 basis point increase in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported a 16% increase in its net sales.
Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 21.7% of net sales, an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior quarter. Notably, the heritage ready-mix concrete business gross margin expanded 570 points. These are primarily the operations acquired in the Denver market at the end of 2011, which have demonstrated steady improvement since the acquisition. We expect a similar trend in the acquired TXI ready-mix business.
Our Specialty Products business posted record fourth quarter net sales of $58.2 million and a gross margin of 39%, contributing earnings from operations of $19.8 million.
Slides 4 through 6 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the fourth quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $31 million and shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.13 per ton, helped by increased rail distribution yard and sand and gravel shipments. Performance in the aggregates business should improve at an accelerated pace given the strength of underlying market demand and synergy realization. 
The acquired ready-mix concrete business shipped 1.3 million cubic yards during the quarter with an average selling price of $82.74. In the Southwest, fourth quarter selling prices and production costs were typically lower than in the warmer months when temperature control measures are required during the production process. Such measures are passed on as additive pricing when incurred. A $6 per yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1. Full realization of the increase will likely take 6 months as we work through the current backlog.
As a reminder, the cement business includes a leading position in the Texas markets and a state-of-the-art rail-located cement plant in Southern California. The Texas plants continued to operate in markets where demand currently exceeds local available supply, a trend expected to continue for the near future. In the fourth quarter, we shipped 1 million tons of cement. Cement pricing of $93.02 per ton is $7.07 or 8.2% higher than third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the cement business generated $100 million of net sales and $28 million in gross profit. The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization and the California plant is operating in the low 70s percent utilization, reflective of a slower Southern California instruction economy recovery. We continue to anticipate California markets should reach a supply/demand equilibrium during 2016. Our cement group leadership is implementing strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, plant utilization and efficiency, thereby creating a roadmap for significantly improved future profitability.
A remaining key area of emphasis is to increase and accelerate the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. We are thus pleased to announce our revised expectations of $100 million of annual synergies by 2016. For the second half of 2014, we achieved synergies of nearly $28 million, 53% above our guidance. These results are not possible without the relentless and effective efforts of our workforce. I'm proud to thank and commend our employees for their stellar progress. We plan to complete the systems integration for the cement and ready-mix concrete businesses no later than June of this year. Accordingly, and as planned, certain duplicative corporate overhead costs will continue through that time.
As previously announced, we acquired over $500 million of TXI's net operating loss or NOL carryforwards. We used $48 million of these benefits to reduce our cash taxes to 17% of our income tax expense. We expect to utilize the remaining NOLs over the next 2 to 3 years.
For the fourth quarter, consolidated SG&A was 6.4% of net sales, a 120 basis point reduction compared with the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects both lower pension expense as well as net sales growth, which outpaced the increase in SG&A. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $1.7 million, which reflects our estimated quarterly run rate related to TXI going forward.
As detailed on Slide 7, our consolidated earnings from operations were $119 million. This compares to $63 million in the prior year quarter and represents an improvement of nearly 90%. For the full year, we generated $382 million of operating cash flow compared with $309 million for 2013. Importantly, though, excluding payments for acquisition-related expenses, adjusted operating cash flow was $452 million. This increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and less cash taxes, partially offset by cash utilized for working capital. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2014, was slightly less than 2.5x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our target as of year end.
Our ability to generate cash has provided us the opportunity to increase our return to shareholders in addition to the quarterly dividend. Consistent with this objective, this morning, we announced a new share buyback program that includes authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. To provide context of this number, this represents nearly 30% of our outstanding shares as well as the number of shares issued on our July 1, 2014, acquisition of TXI. We expect to complete the program over 3 years. However, the actual timing will depend on available cash and the market price for our stock during the time frame. Our balance sheet strength has allowed us to provide this return to our shareholders while also continuing to invest in our business responsibly.
Moving to our 2015 guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets, both geographically, particularly in areas with strong employment gains, and construction end-use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies, we expect growth in our 3 largest end-use markets. The infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. Residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase. And the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat.
Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12%, with a 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business, and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 4% to 6% over 2014. Aggregates product line cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014.
The aggregates-related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross product -- gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million.
Magnesia specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. 
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6% despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension cost over 2014.
On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $825 million to $875 million. Interest should approximate $75 million to $80 million. And the estimated effective income tax rate is expected to be 32%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern, highly efficient rail-connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas, including Houston, for generations.
To conclude, we're grateful to our shareholders for their support throughout an exciting and transformational year. The TXI acquisition strengthened and broadened our foundation, and we're well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for building materials and to continue delivering enhanced shareholder value.

I guess 2 components in that. Number one, you have to remember, when we went into the transaction and closed it on July 1, because of the antitrust process, our operating teams had really only had about a couple of weeks with that business before we closed. So from a practical matter, their time on the ground and their time looking for what we find, or what we term found synergies, was really pretty short. So what's happened is you're seeing really the result of having our teams and therefore more expanded period of time. That's what's really driven the acceleration of these synergies. So I'm not that surprised by it. I knew if we could get our good people on the ground, they would capture those and we would see them quickly. And I do think they did a fantastic job with that. To the next part of your question, where are we in the innings? I think we're in the early innings of this game. Again, we've owned this business for a little bit over half a year. You're seeing that type of synergy realization that quickly. You have to assume that we, as a combined workforce, and that's what we are now, will continue to work very effectively to find more.

That was down about 350,000 tons for the quarter. We saw a pullback in the Eagle Ford. Oddly enough, or maybe not oddly enough, we saw Haynesville actually up. So what you're seeing is a little bit of a play on gas versus gas and oil, Kathryn. If we go back and look at the full year, it's around 7.5 million tons. You're just been dead-on on that. Most of that is going to either roads or pads or otherwise, but here's the take that we have on it. What we're seeing is a strong enough recovery in other areas of nonres that we think that's going to offset whatever bumps there may be in some elements of the product simply going to the different shale plays. So from where we're sitting, shale play has always been in nonres all by itself. We're just seeing other portions of it, they're growing so rapidly. We think it's likely to offset that. But the other piece of it, Kathryn, though, that I think is important is the way energy has been moving, particularly in a state like Texas. To put some metrics to it, we used, I want to say, 17 million gallons of diesel fuel in the Southwest last year. So as we're watching oil prices come down and it affects some degree of volume going to channel fields, the answer is yes. Do I think it's going to be horribly dramatic? The answer to that is no. Do I think the cost benefit that we're likely to see from that is much better than the downside on the volume? The answer to that is absolutely."

From an infrastructure perspective, it's simply getting larger. And keep in mind, even the Energy Carter Road work that started last year, about $150 million worth of that work was let. So Texas would tell you they've got a $1 billion issue there all by themselves.

At the same time, when we come back and take a look at more traditional commercial, in other words what's going on in office, what's going on in retail, what's going on in shopping centers, what we're seeing right now, Trey, is considerably more work in that space than we've seen over the last several years. What you'll remember is we've seen a lot of heavy work in nonres over the last 2 or 3 years, but not a lot on the lighter side of commercial. Now we are starting to see that turn. But we're also starting to see that turn in other states that are important to us: South Carolina, up 14%; Colorado, up 17%. So again, very good nonres activity across the board."

Could you -- so I guess the question is, are you actually implicitly telling us at the midpoint, you said $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash, it's really more like $2.5 billion is what you're thinking to generate if you can fund this whole thing organically, or does that include asset sales beyond the $100 million, I mean, Oro Grande, if you were to sell that, or lever up? I guess that's what kind people are trying to square up today as you're talking buying back $2.7 billion of stock at today's market price, and what you've outlined is not a big cash number that is even close to $2.7 billion.

The Florida program, as you referenced, is really very, very strong. I mean, it is the largest DOT budget in that state's history. One thing that's important about a state like Florida, and I think it's a good model for the rest of the country, less than 30% of their DOT money actually originates from federal coffers, which gives that nice staying power all the way through. And of course, Colorado, as we discussed, has a good DOT program, supplemented by their RAMP program, supplemented by a lot of FEMA spending in that marketplace right now. So you've got a series of markets in addition to what's going on in Texas that have actually done quite well as you recall.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, we were pleased to complete a transformational year in 2014 for Martin Marietta, culminating with a 77% increase in fourth quarter net earnings over the prior year quarter. Our results reflect growth in the heritage aggregates business, the expanding contribution from the acquired TXI operations and the consistently strong performance by our magnesia specialties business. Additionally, we also announced a 20 million share repurchase program on which I'll further elaborate later in the teleconference.
In addition to earnings growth, we were pleased to announce positive developments related to TXI synergies. First, we exceeded our previously announced guidance for 2014 by 53% or nearly $10 million. Second, based on our integration progress to-date, we now expect to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016, more than 40% over our previous guidance. This rate of synergy realization made the TXI acquisition modestly accretive to 2014 earnings, excluding of course, the onetime costs related to the transaction. This accretion should continue into 2015 and beyond based on incremental synergy realization coupled with continued growth in the underlying business. These developments confirm our ability to deliver on our objectives and create additional shareholder value.
Before further discussing the quarterly and full year results, as a reminder, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
To continue to provide transparency into our fourth quarter results, we will again discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of acquired operations. To facilitate this discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that is consistent with how management analyzes the business.
First, as detailed on Slide 2, the heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes magnesia specialties, provides a same-on-same comparison to the prior fourth year quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally, on Slide 7, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better understand the drivers of our performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report volume growth in all product lines and in all reportable groups within the aggregates product line. Additionally, pricing strength was notable in both aggregates and ready-mix concrete product lines. Consistent with trends seen throughout 2014, fourth quarter aggregates business growth was led by robust activity in our West Group, primarily in Texas and Colorado. Texas continues to benefit from a strong state Department of Transportation. With a cumulative budget of $20 billion over fiscal years 2013 to 2015, Texas has created a sizable project backlog. This public work is naturally separate and distinct from a very healthy private sector in Texas. Thus, while the aggregates product line shipment increase in the West Group was approximately 8.5%, the same-on-same comparison reflects growth of more than 15%. This comparison excludes shipments in the prior-year quarter from the North Troy quarry in Oklahoma and 2 rail yards in the Dallas area, which were divested in the third quarter of 2014. This transaction was actually the only required divestiture for the approval of the TXI acquisition by the United States Department of Justice in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino review.
North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all rank in the top 5 states for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Consistent with this trend, recovery in the construction market is underway in the Eastern half of the country although currently lagging the West. Heritage aggregates product line volumes in the Mid-America Group, which increased 7.7%, reflects growth throughout North Carolina. The Southeast Group benefited from activity -- increased activity in Florida, where the TIFIA-funded I-4 project is beginning and the housing market is also improving.
Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets. The infrastructure market represented 44% of quarterly volumes and the shipments to this sector increased 12%. This growth reflects double-digit improvement in each reportable group and notably was achieved while the federal transportation funding is being provided under a continuing resolution through May 31. During this time, we've seen increasing momentum for a multiyear federal highway bill. The executive and congressional branches of government each recognize the need to invest in the country's aging and deficient infrastructure. Despite bipartisan support for a new bill, the main area of debate continues to be the funding source.
The nonresidential end-use market represented 32% of quarterly heritage volumes, and shipments increased 4% over the prior year quarter. Growth was achieved in the commercial and energy sectors. While declining oil prices cause concern about the sustainability of energy-related projects, we don't expect a significant impact on our business based on both the backlog and the momentum of committed projects as well as $100 billion of anticipated projects along the Gulf Coast, a significant portion of which are in Texas.
Additionally, late last year, Texas voters approved Proposition 1, which authorizes annual disbursements from the state's existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund. An estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred this fiscal year alone.
The residential end-use market represented 15% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes, and shipments increased 5% over the prior year quarter. We continue to experience significant residential construction growth in our Western markets. By way of example, through the 12 months ending December 31, 2014, residential starts rose 33% in San Antonio, 10% in Houston and 37% in Austin. This reaffirms our view of the value of the company's strategic growth initiatives made over the last several years, which should continue to benefit our future demand.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets, ChemRock and Rail represented the remaining 9% of our heritage aggregates product line volume and shipments, increasing 5% versus the prior year quarter. This growth reflects an increase in ballast shipments, partially offset by a slowdown in agricultural line shipments.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing remains strong, and we're pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Pricing increased 6% over the prior year quarter, led by a 9% increase in the West Group. For the full year, heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 4% in line with our guidance.
Aggregates product line cost per ton shipped declined 2% compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction reflects increased operating leverage and an 11% decline in energy costs driven by lower oil prices.
The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their total gross profit $5 million. The ready-mix concrete product line experienced pricing and volume increases of 11% and 2%, respectively, which led to an 840 basis point increase in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported a 16% increase in its net sales.
Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 21.7% of net sales, an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior-year quarter. Notably, the heritage ready-mix concrete business gross margin expanded 570 points. These are primarily the operations acquired in the Denver market at the end of 2011, which have demonstrated steady improvement since the acquisition. We expect a similar trend in the acquired TXI ready-mix business.
Our Specialty Products business posted record fourth quarter net sales of $58.2 million and a gross margin of 39%, contributing earnings from operations of $19.8 million.
Slides 4 through 6 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the fourth quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $31 million on shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.13 per ton, helped by increased rail distribution yard, and sand and gravel shipments. Performance in the aggregates business should improve at an accelerated pace given the strength of underlying market demand and synergy realization. 
The acquired ready-mix concrete business shipped 1.3 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $82.74. In the Southwest, fourth quarter selling prices and production costs are typically lower than in the warmer months when temperature control measures are required during the production process. Such measures are passed on as additive pricing when incurred. A $6-per-yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1. Full realization of the increase will likely take 6 months as we work through the current backlog.
As a reminder, the cement business includes a leading position in the Texas markets and a ""state of the art"" rail-located cement plant in Southern California. The Texas plants continue to operate in markets where demand currently exceeds local available supply, a trend expected to continue for the near future. In the fourth quarter, we shipped 1 million tons of cement. Cement pricing of $93.02 per ton is $7.07 or 8.2% higher than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the cement business generated $100 million of net sales and $28 million in gross profit. The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization, and the California plant is operating in the low 70s percent utilization, reflective of a slower Southern California construction economy recovery. We continue to anticipate California markets should reach a supply/demand equilibrium during 2016. Our cement group leadership is implementing strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, plant utilization and efficiency, thereby creating a road map for significantly improved future profitability.
A remaining key area of emphasis is to increase and accelerate the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. We are thus pleased to announce our revised expectations of $100 million of annual synergies by 2016. For the second half of 2014, we achieved synergies of nearly $28 million, 53% above our guidance. These results are not possible without the relentless and effective efforts of our workforce. I'm proud to thank and commend our employees for their stellar progress. We plan to complete the systems integration for the cement and ready-mix concrete businesses no later than June of this year. Accordingly and as planned, certain duplicative corporate overhead costs will continue through that time.
As previously announced, we acquired over $500 million of TXI's net operating loss or NOL carryforwards. We used $48 million of these benefits to reduce our cash taxes to 17% of our income tax expense. We expect to utilize the remaining NOLs over the next 2 to 3 years.
For the fourth quarter, consolidated SG&A was 6.4% of net sales, a 120 basis point reduction compared with the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects both lower pension expense as well as net sales growth, which outpaced the increase in SG&A. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $1.7 million, which reflects our estimated quarterly run rate related to TXI going forward.
As detailed on Slide 7, our consolidated earnings from operations were $119 million. This compares to $63 million in the prior year quarter and represents an improvement of nearly 90%. For the full year, we generated $382 million of operating cash flow compared with $309 million for 2013. Importantly, though, excluding payments for acquisition-related expenses, adjusted operating cash flow was $452 million. This increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and less cash taxes, partially offset by cash utilized for working capital. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2014, was slightly less than 2.5x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our target as of year end.
Our ability to generate cash has provided us the opportunity to increase our return to shareholders in addition to the quarterly dividend. Consistent with this objective, this morning, we announced a new share buyback program that includes authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. To provide context of this number, this represents nearly 30% of our outstanding shares as well as the number of shares issued on our July 1, 2014, acquisition of TXI. We expect to complete the program over 3 years. However, the actual timing will depend on available cash and the market price of our stock during the time frame. Our balance sheet strength has allowed us to provide this return to our shareholders while also continuing to invest in our business responsibly.
Moving to our 2015 guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets, both geographically, particularly in areas with strong employment gains, and construction end use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies, we expect growth in our 3 largest end-use markets. The infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. The residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase. And the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat.
Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12% with a 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business, and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 4% to 6% over 2014. Aggregates product line cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014.
The aggregates-related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million, and gross product -- gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million.
Magnesia specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. 
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6% despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension cost over 2014.
On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $825 million to $875 million. Interest should approximate $75 million to $80 million. And the estimated effective income tax rate is expected to be 32%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern, highly efficient rail-connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas, including Houston, for generations.
To conclude, we're grateful to our shareholders for their support throughout an exciting and transformational year. The TXI acquisition strengthened and broadened our foundation, and we're well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for building materials and to continue delivering enhanced shareholder value.

I guess 2 components in that. Number one, you have to remember, when we went into the transaction and closed it on July 1 because of the antitrust process, our operating teams had really only had about a couple of weeks with that business before we closed. So from a practical matter, their time on the ground and their time looking for what we find or what we term found synergies, was really pretty short. So what's happened is you're seeing really the result of having our teams and, therefore, more expanded period of time. That's what's really driven the acceleration of these synergies. So I'm not that surprised by it. I knew if we could get our good people on the ground, they would capture those, and we would see them quickly. And I do think they did a fantastic job with that. To the next part of your question, where are we in the innings? I think we're in the early innings of this game. Again, we've owned this business for a little bit over half a year. You're seeing that type of synergy realization that quickly. You have to assume that we use the combined workforce, and that's what we are now, will continue to work very effectively to find more. And I think you should expect us to find more."

That was down about 350,000 tons for the quarter. We saw a pullback in the Eagle Ford. Oddly enough, or maybe not oddly enough, we saw Haynesville actually up. So what you're seeing is a little bit of a play on gas versus gas and oil, Kathryn. If we go back and look at the full year, it was around 7.5 million tons. You're just been dead on, on that. Most of that is going to either roads or pads or otherwise, but here's the take that we have on it. What we're seeing is a strong enough recovery in other areas of nonres that we think that's going to offset whatever bumps there may be in some elements of the product simply going to the different shale plays. So from where we're sitting, the shale play has always been in nonres all by itself. We're just seeing other portions of it that are growing so rapidly. We think it's likely to offset that. But the other piece of it, Kathryn, though, that I think is important is the way energy has been moving, particularly in a state like Texas. To put some metrics to it, we used, I want to say, 17 million gallons of diesel fuel in the Southwest last year. So as we're watching oil prices come down, can it affect some degree of volume going to channel [ph] fields, the answer is yes. Do I think it's going to be horribly dramatic? The answer to that is no. Do I think the cost benefit that we're likely to see from that is much better than the downside on the volume? The answer to that is absolutely."

But Texas will tell you they've got a $1 billion issue there all by themselves.

At the same time, when we come back and take a look at more traditional commercial, in other words what's going on in office, what's going on in retail, what's going on in shopping centers, what we're seeing right now, Trey, is considerably more work in that space than we've seen over the last several years. What you'll remember is we've seen a lot of heavy work in nonres over the last 2 or 3 years but not a lot on the lighter side of commercial. Now we're starting to see that turn.

And again, what we're seeing particularly in North Texas around infrastructure, we think is a great story. And again, to your point, we're seeing lower occupancy rates in nonres than we've seen in Dallas in close to a decade right now. So when we look at what's going on in sold-outs in that market, what we can do with pricing in that market, but to your point, what we can do in aggregates with synergies in TXI and emerging strength in the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic group that's performing more strongly, that's the key to it.

So my second question would be, just following up on a couple others.

So my second question would be, just following up on a couple others. I mean, we're the second-highest estimates on The Street, and I understand and appreciate kind of the tax shield related to the NOL, but cumulatively, we have you generating like $1.7 billion of cash over the next 3 years which, based on your comment, sounds too low. I know you talked about $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash, but you're talking about, at $135, that's $2.7 billion in buybacks. So I think that's what we're trying to struggle with that math. Could you -- so I guess the question is, are you actually implicitly telling us at the midpoint, you said $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash, it's really more like $2.5 billion is what you're thinking to generate if you can fund this whole thing organically? Or does that include asset sales beyond the $100 million, I mean, Oro Grande, if you were to sell that or lever it? I guess that's what kind of I think people are trying to square up today as you're talking about buying back $2.7 billion of stock at today's market price, and what you've outlined is not a big cash number that is even close to $2.7 billion. So maybe can you just talk about that a little more to help us understand it?"

Georgia, remember, as you well know, the T Plus [ph] program has put $1.8 billion over 10 years in South Georgia primarily. So now that's starting to pull through to a degree. The Florida program, as you referenced, is really very, very strong. I mean, it's the largest DOT budget in that state's history. One thing that's important about a state like Florida, and I think it's a good model for the rest of the country, less than 30% of their DOT money actually originates from federal coffers, which gives that a nice staying power all the way through. And of course, Colorado, as we discussed, has a good DOT program supplemented by their RAMP program, supplemented by a lot of FEMA spending in that marketplace right now. So you've got a series of markets in addition to what's going on in Texas that have actually done quite well as you recall. When we actually gave guidance last year at this same time for 2014, we anticipated the infrastructure would be up, and I think really a lot of people had some skepticism about it at the time, and we said where you are really matters on these DOT programs. And that's exactly what happened in '14. That's what we think is going to happen in '15 as well."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, we reported a first quarter profit for the first time since 2008, another validation of our recent growth initiatives and cost management programs. Our results reflect aggregates product line volume growth and a double-digit pricing increase, which we achieved despite severe late winter weather in many markets and significant rainfall in Texas, which we estimate reduced West Group earnings by $13 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The Magnesia Specialties business generated first quarter record net sales and gross profit, and the acquired operations provided significant contributions to our earnings and cash flow.
Before providing specific comments on the quarter, I'm pleased to tell you that the foundation, position and momentum within our business should translate into strong growth as we expect to benefit from an environment of increasing demand for construction materials.
As a preparatory reminder, today's conference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
Consistent with recent quarters, I'll discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and 2 other small aggregates product line operations. While it's currently important to consider the results of heritage versus acquired operations so that we're fully transparent with our results and you can analyze and evaluate the quality of our financial performance, this comparison becomes less meaningful as we complete the integration of the TXI operations into our core business. In addition, we facilitate this discussion we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that presents details of our performance. First, as detailed on Slide 2, the heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes Magnesia Specialties, provides a same-on-same comparison to the prior year first quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations, by product line and in total, are provided on Slide 4. And finally, on Slide 6, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying transfer for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line of the heritage aggregates business. First, we're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. It's important to note that the prior year first quarter includes shipments from the 3 facilities in the West Group that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these 3 locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were up slightly, while shipments from the heritage aggregates business increased 7%. Further, and as you are aware, our business is an outdoor undertaking, and weather can disproportionately affect quarterly results, particularly so in the first quarter. On the whole, winter weather was modestly better across our enterprise during the early portion of the quarter as compared to last year. However, Texas precipitation this year was above average, near record levels, according to the National Climatic Data Center. In fact, we estimate approximately 1.4 million tons of aggregates product line shipments were deferred from the first quarter to the remainder of the year. Heritage West Group aggregate volumes, excluding shipments from the divested operations from the prior year quarter, would've increased approximately 7.5%, had we not incurred weather delays. Ready-mixed concrete shipments were reduced by approximately 200,000 cubic yards. Naturally, profitability from this product lines was also negatively affected by lower production and efficiency levels. As previously discussed, we estimate West Group earnings were reduced by up to $13 million during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, our commitment to operational excellence, cost discipline and continued synergy realization from the acquired businesses enabled us to post a very strong quarter.
Aggregates product line growth was led by the infrastructure end-use markets and driven by large projects. Notable growth was experienced in North Carolina and Iowa. This trend coincides with indicators of further recovery in the eastern half of the United States as North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all now ranked in the top 5 states for job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity. Texas is second in the nation in job growth, and the State Department of Transportation has a fiscal 2015 budget of nearly $9 billion. This amount includes funds provided by Texas's proposition 1 constitutional amendment, which addresses needed road repairs, including infrastructure work in South Texas. This amendment is expected to provide over $1 billion per annum for the foreseeable future. And in fact, over $1 billion has already been allocated to specific districts within Texas. This 2015 activity, coupled with an existing backlog, should generate robust infrastructure construction activity over the next several years. Additionally on March 1, 2015, Iowa enacted a $0.10 per gallon increase in state gas tax, which is expected to increase annual infrastructure funding by approximately $215 million. Several other states, including North Carolina and Georgia, are considering additional legislative measures to increase state-level funding.
We're pleased to see states continue to prioritize funding infrastructure initiatives, while Congress deliberates a long-term federal highway bill. The provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act or MAP-21 have been extended through May 31, and we anticipate another continuing resolution through the fall of Congress works toward passage of a multiyear bill. Shipments to the nonresidential end-use market were up slightly as the economic recovery enters a more construction-centric phase. For us, this market is broadly comprised of 2 components, light and heavy construction. And importantly, we're beginning to see a nascent return to a 50-50 balance between these 2 categories, a normal equilibrium. Light nonresidential component is primarily office and retail, and demand of this component is generally tied more directly to residential demand with a 12- to 18-month lag. The heavy component is primarily industrial building in energy, with both direct and energy-related shipments serving this area. The heavy nonresidential end-use market represented 25% of quarterly heritage aggregates volumes, and shipments increased 1% over the prior year quarter. Texas leads the country with $39 billion in nonresidential starts during the trailing 12 months ended March 2015 and billions more expected to be started. Further, diversified state economies have generated other nonresidential and infrastructure projects to replace direct energy sector shipments currently displaced by volatile oil prices. The company expects energy-related construction activity to remain strong, supported by more than $100 billion of plant projects along the Gulf coast, including a significant portion in Texas. The residential end-use market represented 15% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth has slowed compared with the last few years, in part due to an inventory reduction and the availability of unimproved building lots in our markets. We were encouraged to see Georgia, Florida and South Carolina join Colorado in reporting double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months through March. This represents yet another sign of recovery in the Eastern United States.
Finally, to conclude discussion of end-use markets for the first quarter, the ChemRock and rail market represented the remaining 11% of our heritage aggregates volume, and shipments were up slightly compared to the prior year quarter. A positive trend for this end-use is the increasing investment in capacity expansion and maintenance by major railroads, which should lead to higher demand for ballast shipments.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 10.5% over the prior year quarter, led by the West Group. Based on what we're expecting for the remainder of the year, we're raising full year aggregates product line pricing guidance from what was a projected increase of 4% to 6% to now an increase of 7% to 9% over our 2014 results. Heritage aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped remained relatively flat compared with the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices, and on average, paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.18 in the prior year quarter.
Heritage aggregates downstream-related product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3 million, primarily driven by the ready-mixed concrete product line, where nearly 11% increase in average selling price led to a 490 basis point increase in the product line gross margin.
Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 9.7% of net sales, improvement of 703 basis points over the prior year quarter. All reportable segments generated a higher gross margin, led by an increase of 1,040 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. Our heritage business generated an incremental gross margin of 76%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. This performance was led by long-awaited recovery in both in the Mid-East and Southeast divisions. We expect continued economic recovery in other geographic areas hardest hit over the past several years.
The Magnesia Specialties business continues its exceptional performance and generated net sales of $58.8 million and a gross profit of $20.2 million, both of which represent first quarter records. For the quarter, the business achieved a gross margin of 34.3%, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year quarter.
Slides 4 and 5 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. In the first quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $32 million on external shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.83 per ton, which reflects the product mix skewed towards higher-priced sand and gravel and rail yard shipments compared to our heritage operations. Despite the negative impact of weather during the quarter, we're pleased to deliver gross margin improvement compared with the performance in the second half of 2014. Our recently acquired ready-mixed concrete business shipped nearly 1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $88.75. This reflects a $6 per cubic yard increase implemented last August in the North Texas market. As a reminder, pricing increases typically have a 6-month lag before full realization. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected operations and reduced the profitability of this business by an estimated $6 million.
The Cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. However, first quarter operating results were negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year. For the first quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $93.41, resulting in net sales of more than $96 million. The business achieved a gross margin of nearly 20% after incurring $5.5 million of plant kiln and maintenance costs. We expect to incur $2 million of some of our costs in the second quarter, with $11 million and $10 million of such expenses in both the third and fourth quarters, respectively.
During the first quarter, the company announced a price increase of $10 per ton in the Texas and California markets, effective April 1.
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were 7.8% of net sales, a decline of 120 basis points. This improvement reflects net sales growth outpacing the increase in SG&A, partially offset by higher pension expense. We also incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $1.6 million, which reflects our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.
As detailed on Slide 6, our reported earnings from operations for the quarter of $25.6 million improved $41.5 million from the prior year quarter loss of $15.9 million. Our synergy expectations are consistent with our most recent guidance. We did complete the systems integration for the Cement and ready-mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, in line with our integration plan. We recorded a small income tax benefit in the quarter driven by discrete events. However, excluding discrete events, our effective income tax rate would've been 31%, in line with our full year guidance. For the year, we expect a fully utilized allowable net operating loss carryforwards of $363 million, which will reduce cash taxes.
For the quarter, we generated $35 million of operating cash flow compared with $7 million for 2014. The increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in the first quarter of 2015 for the 2014 tax year. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2015, was slightly less than 2.5x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. We expect to complete the program over the next 2 [ph] years. However, the actual timing will depend on available cash and market price of our stock during the time frame.
Moving to our full year guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets, both geographically, particularly in areas with stronger employment gains and construction end-use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue, and importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies, we expect growth in our 3 largest end-use markets. Infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. The residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase, and the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat. Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12% with 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. Again, we expect aggregates product line pricing to now be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. The aggregates-related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the Smith business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million. The Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%, despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension costs over 2014. On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA ranging from $835 million to $875 million. Interest expense should approximate $75 million to $80 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be 31%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern and highly efficient rail-connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas, including Houston, for generations.
To conclude, we are very excited about future of Martin Marietta Materials. Our commitment to core foundational pillars of world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, along with the growing demand for construction materials, should lead to improved profitability and allow us to continue to increase shareholder value.

So you're entirely right. Does this pricing help? Yes, it does. Does cost management help? Yes, it does. Does geographic mix, where you're starting to see some business come back, help a lot? It does. I mean let's talk a little bit about what we saw relative to our production analysis just on the cost side. I mean, the pricing side, I think you can see with greater clarity. But we're looking at total heritage aggregates cost per ton, they declined 17% or 2% after adjusting for increased production volumes. What we did, Todd, is we were able to fully capture a 36% decline per gallon in diesel cost during the quarter, but we saw heritage production volume go up 12% or 2.9 million tons. So what's happening at the end of the day, separate and distinct from what's going on in pricing, is each incremental ton was produced at 20% lower than it was in 2014 from a natural cost per ton. So you're what you're seeing on both sides of the equation, the pricing, I think, from the release really jumps out and hits you in the face. But I think what's happening on the cost side is what's happening geographically is important in that 76% as well."

So I feel comfortable we'll capture all of that. And clearly, a lot of that was driven by rain. I mean, I don't want to turn into a weather man here today, but I look at something to me that I thought was moving on how weather affected particularly North Texas. If we look at water reservoirs in North Texas a year ago, they were 68% full. If we look at where they were 3 months ago, they were 64% full. And if we look at where they are today, they're 94% full. I mean, that's a remarkable rate in North Texas. That's what, among other things, gives me confidence. That volume's been pushing to that. That volume it's gone. And what we are seeing in nonres and other parts of Texas continues to be very strong. We feel comfortable that whatever weakness we're seeing in shale energy gas will be picked up by housing, and gas will be picked up by other components of nonres. And to answer your question really directed on what we're seeing relative to shale. It's in an even story. I mean, here's what I see. I see volumes down in the first quarter in Eagle Ford Shale, 31%. I see volumes up in Haynesville 142%. Now the short answer is do I think they're going to be down overall, just pure shale volumes? Yes, I do. But here's my take on it, Kathryn. I think they're going to look a lot like they did in 2012. And in 2012, all rolled in, we sold about 6 million tons to the different shale plays. And when I think back to 2012, number one, everybody liked the way 2012 felt. And nobody really thought they'd be that good. So that we think it'll be back into 2012 level in '15? We do. Are we seeing uneven movements in some the plays? We are. Do we think that volumes that was lost in Q1 were simply deferred? We do. I think I answered your questions. Is that responsive?"

We got an $8 -- or call it, $9 billion budget this year that's coming on the tail of a couple of the record of DOT budgets in Texas. So what I would tell you is that anybody tells you what they think Texas is going to be next year and the year after is going to be wrong because if we looked at Texas, and we went back 2 or 3 years, and did that same look-forward, we, too, would've been wrong. It's just consistently been better than anyone would have thought. And part of what I find moving what's going on in Texas right now on that $1.1 billion is already been basically dedicated for this year under prop 1. When we come back and look at what that means, it's $85 million in Austin. It's $82 million in Dallas. It's $206 million in Houston, and it's $147 million in San Antonio. So if we think back over the last several years on the part of Texas that was not getting as much infrastructure than some of the others, it was places like San Antonio that now have a toll system and they did 4. And they're good slug from prop 1. So if you're looking at restructuring Texas right now, but our team in Texas would tell me us, ""Ward, we've got 2, 3 or 4 years of work ahead of us right now."""

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.As announced in this morning's release, we reported the first quarter profit for t",2750,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, we reported the first quarter profit for the first time since 2008, another validation of our recent growth initiatives and cost management programs. Our results reflect aggregates product line volume growth and a double-digit pricing increase, which we achieved despite severe late-winter weather in many markets and significant rainfall in Texas, which we estimate reduced West Group earnings by $13 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The Magnesia Specialties business generated first quarter record net sales and gross profit, and the acquired operations provided a significant contribution to our earnings and cash flow.
Before providing specific comments on the quarter, I'm pleased to tell you that the foundation, position and momentum within our business should translate into strong growth, as we expect to benefit from an environment of increasing demand for construction materials.
As a preparatory reminder, today's conference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
Consistent with recent quarters, I'll discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and 2 other small aggregates product line operations. While it's currently important to consider the results of heritage versus acquired operations so that we're fully transparent with our results and you can analyze and evaluate the quality of our financial performance, this comparison becomes less meaningful as we complete the integration of the TXI operations into our core business. In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that presents details of our performance. 
First, as detailed on Slide 2, the heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes Magnesia Specialties, provides a same-on-same comparison to the prior year first quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally, on Slide 6, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. First, we're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. It's important to note that the prior year first quarter includes shipments from 3 facilities in the West Group that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these 3 locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were up slightly, while shipments from the heritage aggregates business increased 7%. Further, and as you are aware, our business is an outdoor undertaking, and weather can disproportionately affect quarterly results, particularly so in the first quarter. On the whole, winter weather was modestly better across our enterprise during the early portion of the quarter as compared to last year. However, Texas precipitation this year was above average, near-record levels, according to the National Climatic Data Center. In fact, we estimate approximately 1.4 million tons of aggregates product line shipments were deferred from the first quarter to the remainder of the year. Heritage West Group aggregate volumes, excluding shipments from the divested operations from the prior year quarter, would've increased approximately 7.5% had we not incurred weather delays. Ready-mixed concrete shipments were reduced by approximately 200,000 cubic yards. Naturally, profitability from these product lines was also negatively affected by lower production and efficiency levels. As previously discussed, we estimate West Group earnings were reduced by up to $13 million during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, our commitment to operational excellence, cost discipline and continued synergy realization from the acquired businesses enabled us to post a very strong quarter.
Aggregates product line growth was led by the infrastructure end-use markets and driven by large projects. Notable growth was experienced in North Carolina and Iowa. This trend coincides with indicators of further recovery in the eastern half of the United States as North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all now ranked in the top 5 states for job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity. Texas is second in the nation in job growth, and the state Department of Transportation has a fiscal 2015 letting budget of nearly $9 billion. This amount includes funds provided by Texas's proposition 1 constitutional amendment, which addresses needed road repairs, including infrastructure work in South Texas. This amendment is expected to provide over $1 billion per annum for the foreseeable future and, in fact, over $1 billion has already been allocated to specific districts within Texas. This 2015 activity, coupled with an existing backlog, should generate robust infrastructure construction activity over the next several years. Additionally on March 1, 2015, Iowa enacted a $0.10 per gallon increase in state gas tax, which is expected to increase annual infrastructure funding by approximately $215 million. Several other states, including North Carolina and Georgia, are considering additional legislative measures to increase state-level funding.
We're pleased to see states continue to prioritize funding infrastructure initiatives, while Congress deliberates a long-term federal highway bill. The provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act or MAP-21 have been extended through May 31, and we anticipate another continuing resolution through the fall while Congress works toward passage of a multiyear bill. Shipments to the nonresidential end-use market were up slightly as the economic recovery enters a more construction-centric phase. For us, this market is broadly comprised of 2 components: light and heavy construction. And importantly, we're beginning to see a nascent return to a 50-50 balance between these 2 categories, a normal equilibrium. 
The light nonresidential component is primarily office and retail, and demand of this component is generally tied more directly to residential demand with a 12- to 18-month lag. The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy, with both direct and energy-related shipments serving this area. The heavy nonresidential end-use market represented 25% of quarterly heritage aggregates volumes, and shipments increased 1% over the prior year quarter. Texas leads the country with $39 billion in nonresidential starts during the trailing 12 months ended March 2015 and billions more expected to be started. Further, diversified state economies have generated other nonresidential and infrastructure projects to replace direct energy sector shipments currently displaced by volatile oil prices. The company expects energy-related construction activity to remain strong, supported by more than $100 billion of planned projects along the Gulf coast, including a significant portion in Texas. The residential end-use market represented 15% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth has slowed compared with the last few years, in part due to an inventory reduction and the availability of unimproved building lots in our markets. We were encouraged to see Georgia, Florida and South Carolina join Colorado in reporting double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months through March. This represents yet another sign of recovery in the Eastern United States.
Finally, to conclude discussion of end-use markets for the first quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 11% of our heritage aggregates volume, and shipments were up slightly compared to the prior year quarter. A positive trend for this end-use is the increasing investment in capacity expansion and maintenance by major railroads, which should lead to higher demand for ballast shipments.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 10.5% over the prior year quarter led by the West Group. Based on what we're expecting for the remainder of the year, we're raising full year aggregates product line pricing guidance from what was a projected increase of 4% to 6% to now an increase of 7% to 9% over our 2014 results. Heritage aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped remained relatively flat compared with the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and, on average, paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.18 in the prior year quarter. Heritage aggregates downstream-related product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3 million, primarily driven by the ready-mixed concrete product line, where nearly 11% increase in average selling price led to a 490-basis-point increase in the product line gross margin. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 9.7% of net sales, an improvement of 730 basis points over the prior year quarter. 
All reportable segments generated a higher gross margin led by an increase of 1,040 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. Our heritage business generated an incremental gross margin of 76%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. This performance was led by long-awaited recovery in both the Mid-East and Southeast divisions. We expect continued economic recovery in other geographic areas hardest hit over the past several years.
The Magnesia Specialties business continues its exceptional performance and generated net sales of $58.8 million and a gross profit of $20.2 million, both of which represent first quarter records. For the quarter, the business achieved a gross margin of 34.3%, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year quarter.
Slides 4 and 5 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the first quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $32 million on external shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.83 per ton, which reflects the product mix skewed towards higher-priced sand and gravel and rail yard shipments compared to our heritage operations. Despite the negative impact of weather during the quarter, we're pleased to deliver gross margin improvement compared with the performance in the second half of 2014. Our recently acquired ready-mixed concrete business shipped nearly 1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $88.75. This reflects the $6 per cubic yard increase implemented last August in the North Texas market. As a reminder, pricing increases typically have a 6-month lag before full realization. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected operations and reduced the profitability of this business by an estimated $6 million.
The Cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. However, first quarter operating results were negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year. For the first quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $93.41 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $96 million. The business achieved a gross margin of nearly 20% after incurring $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We expect to incur $2 million of some of our costs in the second quarter, with $11 million and $10 million of such expenses in both the third and fourth quarters, respectively. During the first quarter, the company announced a price increase of $10 per ton in the Texas and California markets, effective April 1.
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were 7.8% of net sales, a decline of 120 basis points. This improvement reflects net sales growth outpacing the increase in SG&A, partially offset by higher pension expense. We also incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $1.6 million, which reflects our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.
As detailed on Slide 6, our reported earnings from operations for the quarter of $25.6 million improved $41.5 million from the prior year quarter loss of $15.9 million. Our synergy expectations are consistent with our most recent guidance. We did complete the systems integration for the Cement and ready-mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, in line with our integration plan. We recorded a small income tax benefit for the quarter, driven by discrete events. However, excluding discrete events, our effective income tax rate would've been 31%, in line with our full year guidance. For the year, we expect to fully utilize allowable net operating loss carryforwards of $363 million, which will reduce cash taxes.
For the quarter, we generated $35 million of operating cash flow compared with $7 million for 2014. The increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in the first quarter of 2015 for the 2014 tax year. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2015, was slightly less than 2.5x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. We expect to complete the program over the next few years. However, the actual timing will depend on available cash and the market price of our stock during the time frame.
Moving to our full year guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets both geographically, particularly in areas with stronger employment gains and construction end-use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and, importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies, we expect growth in our 3 largest end-use markets. Infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. The residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase, and the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat. 
Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12% with 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. Again, we expect aggregates product line pricing to now be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. The aggregates-related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the Cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million. Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%, despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension costs over 2014. On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA ranging from $835 million to $875 million. Interest expense should approximate $75 million to $80 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be 31%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern and highly efficient rail-connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas, including Houston, for generations.
To conclude, we are very excited about the future of Martin Marietta Materials. Our commitment to core foundational pillars, world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, along with the growing demand for construction materials, should lead to improved profitability and allow us to continue to increase shareholder value.

So you're entirely right. Does pricing help? Yes, it does. Does cost management help? Yes, it does. Does geographic mix, where you're starting to see some business come back, help a lot? It does. I mean, let's talk a little bit about what we saw relative to our production analysis just on the cost side. I mean, the pricing side, I think you can see with greater clarity. But if we're looking at total heritage aggregates cost per ton, they declined 17% or 2% after adjusting for increased production volumes. What we did, Todd, is we were able to fully capture a 36% decline per gallon in diesel cost during the quarter, but we saw heritage production volume go up 12% or 2.9 million tons. So what's happening at the end of the day, separate and distinct from what's going on in pricing, is each incremental ton was produced at 20% lower than it was in 2014 from a natural cost per ton. So you're seeing it on both sides of the equation. The pricing, I think, from the release really jumps out and hits you in the face, but I think what's happening on the cost side and what's happening geographically is important in that 76% as well."

So if you go back to those states that we outlined in my comments where we're seeing good employment movement, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, that's what's driving a lot of that.

So I feel comfortable we'll capture all of that. And clearly, a lot of that was driven by rain. I mean, I don't want to turn into a weather man here today, but I look at something to me that I thought was moving on how weather affected, particularly North Texas. If we look at water reservoirs in North Texas a year ago, they were 68% full. If we look at where they were 3 months ago, they were 64% full. And if we look at where they are today, they're 94% full. I mean, that's remarkable rain in North Texas. That's what, among other things, gives me confidence. That volume's been pushed to the right. It's not volume that's gone. What we are seeing in non-res in other parts of Texas continues to be very strong. We feel comfortable that whatever weakness we're seeing in shale energy, yes, will be picked up by housing, and gas will be picked up by other components of non-res. And to answer your question really directly on what we're seeing relative to shale, it's an uneven story. I mean, here's what I see. I see volumes down in the first quarter in Eagle Ford Shale, 31%. I see volumes up in Haynesville, 142%. Now the short answer is do I think they're going to be down overall just pure shale volumes? Yes, I do. But here's my take on it, Kathryn. I think they're going to look a lot like they did in 2012. And in 2012, all rolled in, we sold about 6 million tons to the different shale plays. And when I think back to 2012, number one, everybody liked the way 2012 felt, and nobody really thought they'd be that good. So do we think it'll be back at the 2012 level in '15? We do. Are we seeing uneven movements in some of the plays? We are. Do we think that volume that was lost in Q1 was simply deferred? We do. I think I answered your questions. Is that responsive?"

Now again, we're seeing pricing move on a percentage basis in the West better than we are at East. That's not a surprise, in large part, because it just has more room to go. But what I would say is, one, dry weather is your friend. Pricing is your friend, but increased deficiencies will continue to be as well. And we think we'll see that. So will the incrementals in the West be as attractive as the East with immediacy? No, they never really have. Do we think they'll close the gap over time? Yes. And will it close the gap at different speeds in different markets? The answer to that is yes as well."

So we're seeing good, solid pricing across that entire marketplace, which, again, I think is indicative of continued momentum there and a continued positive outlook. If contractors feel like they're seeing something awfully challenging coming their way, I don't think we would see that type of pricing momentum in every corner of our business in that state. And when we're speaking to West Group, I need to pause on Colorado, too. We're seeing good movement on aggregate pricing in the Colorado market. And again, part of what I believe we're going to see, Jerry, is more of a hard rock and influence coming in to markets north of Denver, simply because they have alluvial place they're playing out.

Number one, there continue to have the $1 billion from prop 17 profile. Let's keep in mind, too, Texas is a fiscal year that ends in August, not June, so it's different than many of our states. We got an 8 -- or call it, $9 billion budget this year that's coming on the tail of a couple of 3 record of DOT budgets in Texas. So what I would tell you is anybody who tells you what they think Texas is going to be next year and the year after is going to be wrong. Because if we look at Texas and we went back 2 or 3 years and did that same look-forward, we, too, would've been wrong. It's just consistently been better than anyone would have thought. And part of what I find moving and what's going on in Texas right now on that $1.1 billion has already been basically dedicated for this year under prop 1. When we come back and look at what that means, it's $85 million in Austin. It's $82 million in Dallas. It's $206 million in Houston, and it's $147 million in San Antonio. So if we think back over the last several years on the part of Texas that was not getting as much infrastructure as some of the others, it was places like San Antonio that now have a toll system and they did 4. And they're seeing a good slug from prop 1. So as we're looking at infrastructure in Texas right now, what our team in Texas would tell me is, ""Ward, we've got 2, 3 or 4 years of good work ahead of us right now."""

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.As announced in this morning's release, we reported the first quarter profit for t",2751,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, we reported the first quarter profit for the first time since 2008, another validation of our recent growth initiatives and cost management programs. Our results reflect aggregates product line volume growth and a double-digit pricing increase, which we achieved despite severe late-winter weather in many markets and significant rainfall in Texas, which we estimate reduced West Group earnings by $13 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The Magnesia Specialties business generated first quarter record net sales and gross profit, and the acquired operations provided a significant contribution to our earnings and cash flow.
Before providing specific comments on the quarter, I'm pleased to tell you that the foundation, position and momentum within our business should translate into strong growth, as we expect to benefit from an environment of increasing demand for construction materials.
As a preparatory reminder, today's conference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
Consistent with recent quarters, I'll discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and 2 other small aggregates product line operations. While it's currently important to consider the results of heritage versus acquired operations so that we're fully transparent with our results and you can analyze and evaluate the quality of our financial performance, this comparison becomes less meaningful as we complete the integration of the TXI operations into our core business. In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that presents details of our performance. 
First, as detailed on Slide 2, the heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes Magnesia Specialties, provides a same-on-same comparison to the prior year first quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally, on Slide 6, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. First, we're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. It's important to note that the prior year first quarter includes shipments from 3 facilities in the West Group that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these 3 locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were up slightly, while shipments from the heritage aggregates business increased 7%. Further, and as you are aware, our business is an outdoor undertaking, and weather can disproportionately affect quarterly results, particularly so in the first quarter. On the whole, winter weather was modestly better across our enterprise during the early portion of the quarter as compared to last year. However, Texas precipitation this year was above average, near-record levels, according to the National Climatic Data Center. In fact, we estimate approximately 1.4 million tons of aggregates product line shipments were deferred from the first quarter to the remainder of the year. Heritage West Group aggregate volumes, excluding shipments from the divested operations from the prior year quarter, would've increased approximately 7.5% had we not incurred weather delays. Ready-mixed concrete shipments were reduced by approximately 200,000 cubic yards. Naturally, profitability from these product lines was also negatively affected by lower production and efficiency levels. As previously discussed, we estimate West Group earnings were reduced by up to $13 million during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, our commitment to operational excellence, cost discipline and continued synergy realization from the acquired businesses enabled us to post a very strong quarter.
Aggregates product line growth was led by the infrastructure end-use markets and driven by large projects. Notable growth was experienced in North Carolina and Iowa. This trend coincides with indicators of further recovery in the eastern half of the United States as North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all now ranked in the top 5 states for job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity. Texas is second in the nation in job growth, and the state Department of Transportation has a fiscal 2015 letting budget of nearly $9 billion. This amount includes funds provided by Texas's proposition 1 constitutional amendment, which addresses needed road repairs, including infrastructure work in South Texas. This amendment is expected to provide over $1 billion per annum for the foreseeable future and, in fact, over $1 billion has already been allocated to specific districts within Texas. This 2015 activity, coupled with an existing backlog, should generate robust infrastructure construction activity over the next several years. Additionally on March 1, 2015, Iowa enacted a $0.10 per gallon increase in state gas tax, which is expected to increase annual infrastructure funding by approximately $215 million. Several other states, including North Carolina and Georgia, are considering additional legislative measures to increase state-level funding.
We're pleased to see states continue to prioritize funding infrastructure initiatives, while Congress deliberates a long-term federal highway bill. The provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act or MAP-21 have been extended through May 31, and we anticipate another continuing resolution through the fall while Congress works toward passage of a multiyear bill. Shipments to the nonresidential end-use market were up slightly as the economic recovery enters a more construction-centric phase. For us, this market is broadly comprised of 2 components: light and heavy construction. And importantly, we're beginning to see a nascent return to a 50-50 balance between these 2 categories, a normal equilibrium. 
The light nonresidential component is primarily office and retail, and demand of this component is generally tied more directly to residential demand with a 12- to 18-month lag. The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy, with both direct and energy-related shipments serving this area. The heavy nonresidential end-use market represented 25% of quarterly heritage aggregates volumes, and shipments increased 1% over the prior year quarter. Texas leads the country with $39 billion in nonresidential starts during the trailing 12 months ended March 2015 and billions more expected to be started. Further, diversified state economies have generated other nonresidential and infrastructure projects to replace direct energy sector shipments currently displaced by volatile oil prices. The company expects energy-related construction activity to remain strong, supported by more than $100 billion of planned projects along the Gulf coast, including a significant portion in Texas. The residential end-use market represented 15% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth has slowed compared with the last few years, in part due to an inventory reduction and the availability of unimproved building lots in our markets. We were encouraged to see Georgia, Florida and South Carolina join Colorado in reporting double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months through March. This represents yet another sign of recovery in the Eastern United States.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets for the first quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 11% of our heritage aggregates volume, and shipments were up slightly compared to the prior year quarter. A positive trend for this end-use is the increasing investment in capacity expansion and maintenance by major railroads, which should lead to higher demand for ballast shipments.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 10.5% over the prior year quarter led by the West Group. Based on what we're expecting for the remainder of the year, we're raising full year aggregates product line pricing guidance from what was a projected increase of 4% to 6% to now an increase of 7% to 9% over our 2014 results. Heritage aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped remained relatively flat compared with the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and, on average, paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.18 in the prior year quarter. Heritage aggregates downstream-related product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3 million, primarily driven by the ready-mixed concrete product line, where nearly 11% increase in average selling price led to a 490-basis-point increase in the product line gross margin. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 9.7% of net sales, an improvement of 730 basis points over the prior year quarter. 
All reportable segments generated a higher gross margin led by an increase of 1,040 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. Our heritage business generated an incremental gross margin of 76%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. This performance was led by long-awaited recovery in both the Mid-East and Southeast divisions. We expect continued economic recovery in other geographic areas hardest hit over the past several years.
The Magnesia Specialties business continues its exceptional performance and generated net sales of $58.8 million and a gross profit of $20.2 million, both of which represent first quarter records. For the quarter, the business achieved a gross margin of 34.3%, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year quarter.
Slides 4 and 5 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the first quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $32 million on external shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.83 per ton, which reflects the product mix skewed towards higher-priced sand and gravel and rail yard shipments compared to our heritage operations. Despite the negative impact of weather during the quarter, we're pleased to deliver gross margin improvement compared with the performance in the second half of 2014. Our recently acquired ready-mixed concrete business shipped nearly 1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $88.75. This reflects the $6 per cubic yard increase implemented last August in the North Texas market. As a reminder, pricing increases typically have a 6-month lag before full realization. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected operations and reduced the profitability of this business by an estimated $6 million.
The Cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. However, first quarter operating results were negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year. For the first quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $93.41 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $96 million. The business achieved a gross margin of nearly 20% after incurring $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We expect to incur $2 million of some of our costs in the second quarter, with $11 million and $10 million of such expenses in both the third and fourth quarters, respectively. During the first quarter, the company announced a price increase of $10 per ton in the Texas and California markets, effective April 1.
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were 7.8% of net sales, a decline of 120 basis points. This improvement reflects net sales growth outpacing the increase in SG&A, partially offset by higher pension expense. We also incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $1.6 million, which reflects our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.
As detailed on Slide 6, our reported earnings from operations for the quarter of $25.6 million improved $41.5 million from the prior year quarter loss of $15.9 million. Our synergy expectations are consistent with our most recent guidance. We should complete the systems integration for the Cement and ready-mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, in line with our integration plan. We recorded a small income tax benefit for the quarter, driven by discrete events. However, excluding discrete events, our effective income tax rate would've been 31%, in line with our full year guidance. For the year, we expect to fully utilize allowable net operating loss carryforwards of $363 million, which will reduce cash taxes.
For the quarter, we generated $35 million of operating cash flow compared with $7 million for 2014. The increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in the first quarter of 2015 for the 2014 tax year. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2015, was slightly less than 2.5x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. We expect to complete the program over the next few years. However, the actual timing will depend on available cash and the market price of our stock during the time frame.
Moving to our full year guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets both geographically, particularly in areas with stronger employment gains and construction end-use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and, importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies, we expect growth in our 3 largest end-use markets. Infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. The residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase, and the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat. 
Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12% with 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. Again, we expect aggregates product line pricing to now be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. The aggregates-related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the Cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million. Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%, despite an $18 million increase in heritage pension costs over 2014. On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA ranging from $835 million to $875 million. Interest expense should approximate $75 million to $80 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be 31%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy-related capital and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern and highly efficient rail-connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas, including Houston, for generations.
To conclude, we are very excited about the future of Martin Marietta Materials. Our commitment to core foundational pillars, world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, along with the growing demand for construction materials, should lead to improved profitability and allow us to continue to increase shareholder value.

So you're entirely right. Does pricing help? Yes, it does. Does cost management help? Yes, it does. Does geographic mix, where you're starting to see some business come back, help a lot? It does. I mean, let's talk a little bit about what we saw relative to our production analysis just on the cost side. I mean, the pricing side, I think you can see with greater clarity. But if we're looking at total heritage aggregates cost per ton, they declined 17% or 2% after adjusting for increased production volumes. What we did, Todd, is we were able to fully capture a 36% decline per gallon in diesel cost during the quarter, but we saw heritage production volume go up 12% or 2.9 million tons. So what's happening at the end of the day, separate and distinct from what's going on in pricing, is each incremental ton was produced at 20% lower than it was in 2014 from a natural cost per ton. So you're seeing it on both sides of the equation. The pricing, I think, from the release really jumps out and hits you in the face, but I think what's happening on the cost side and what's happening geographically is important in that 76% as well."

So I feel comfortable we'll capture all of that. And clearly, a lot of that was driven by rain. I mean, I don't want to turn into a weather man here today, but I looked at something to me that I thought was moving on how weather affected, particularly North Texas. If we look at water reservoirs in North Texas a year ago, they were 68% full. If we look at where they were 3 months ago, they were 64% full. And if we look at where they are today, they're 94% full. I mean, that's remarkable rain in North Texas. That's what, among other things, gives me confidence. That volume's been pushed to the right. It's not volume that's gone. What we are seeing in non-res in other parts of Texas continues to be very strong. We feel comfortable that whatever weakness we're seeing in shale energy, yes, will be picked up by housing, and gas will be picked up by other components of non-res. And to answer your question really directly on what we're seeing relative to shale, it's an uneven story. I mean, here's what I see. I see volumes down in the first quarter in Eagle Ford Shale, 31%. I see volumes up in Haynesville, 142%. Now the short answer is do I think they're going to be down overall just pure shale volumes? Yes, I do. But here's my take on it, Kathryn. I think they're going to look a lot like they did in 2012. And in 2012, all rolled in, we sold about 6 million tons to the different shale plays. And when I think back to 2012, number one, everybody liked the way 2012 felt, and nobody really thought they'd be that good. So do we think it'll be back at the 2012 level in '15? We do. Are we seeing uneven movements in some of the plays? We are. Do we think that volume that was lost in Q1 was simply deferred? We do. I think I answered your questions. Is that responsive?"

So I think we'd just have to continue to feather that in throughout the year. I think it's hard to give you a percentage on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but -- and that's going to be something that we will see in varying degrees for 2015. It'll be gone at the end of 2015. If you think back to what was going on, on some of those longer-haul cement moves, that was really more of the South Texas issue than it was a North Texas issue. And then if we're going back to the percentage, the percentages that I spoke of, the increases that we're seeing in South Texas are 19%. So I think that does come back and taking time to a degree, Garik."

It was Colorado in January, February and March, which is winter in the Rockies. And it was really going back to a story in North Texas. If you think about what we are in Texas today after the TXI transaction, yes, our position in Houston is important, our position in San Antonio is important, our position in Austin is important, but the North Texas market is the biggest, single market that we have there. And when we're looking at the sheer degree of rain that we had and the days that we could not work in that marketplace, that's the single, biggest driver. Now again, we're seeing pricing move on a percentage basis in the West better than we are at East. That's not a surprise, in large part, because it just has more room to go. But what I would say is, one, dry weather is your friend. Pricing is your friend, but increased deficiencies will continue to be as well. And we think we'll see that. So will the incrementals in the West be as attractive as the East with immediacy? No, they never really have. Do we think they'll close the gap over time? Yes. And will it close the gap at different speeds in different markets? The answer to that is yes as well."

If contractors feel like they're seeing something awfully challenging coming their way, I don't think we would see that type of pricing momentum in every corner of our business in that state. And when we're speaking to West Group, I need to pause on Colorado, too. We're seeing good movement on aggregate pricing in the Colorado market. And again, part of what I believe we're going to see, Jerry, is more of a hard rock and influence coming in to markets north of Denver, simply because they have alluvial plays they're playing out.

Number one, there continue to have the $1 billion from Prop 17 profile. Let's keep in mind, too, Texas is a fiscal year that ends in August, not June, so it's different than many of our states. We got an 8 -- or call it, $9 billion budget this year that's coming on the tail of a couple of 3 record DOT budgets in Texas. So what I would tell you is anybody who tells you what they think Texas is going to be next year and the year after is going to be wrong. Because if we look at Texas and we went back 2 or 3 years and did that same look-forward, we, too, would've been wrong. It's just consistently been better than anyone would have thought. And part of what I find moving and what's going on in Texas right now on that $1.1 billion has already been basically dedicated for this year under Prop 1. When we come back and look at what that means, it's $85 million in Austin. It's $82 million in Dallas. It's $206 million in Houston, and it's $147 million in San Antonio. So if we think back over the last several years on the part of Texas that was not getting as much infrastructure as some of the others, it was places like San Antonio that now have a toll system and they did 4. And they're seeing a good slug from Prop 1. So as we're looking at infrastructure in Texas right now, what our team in Texas would tell me is, ""Ward, we've got 2, 3 or 4 years of good work ahead of us right now."""

So really, one of the most competitive areas with the biggest volume for us is, again, we think back at a 2012 level, that we view relatively attractively.

I think the challenge is that you're seeing in Cement in those March numbers were more weather and location driven than anything else. I do think West Texas is clearly a very different Cement market than the Cement markets in which we participate. So to the extent that those are almost purely energy driven, we're not going to feel that pain.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, our second quarter results reflect continued solid performance and disciplined execution against stated objectives, controlling those things that we can and dealing effectively with those circumstances over which we have no control such as extraordinary weather conditions. I'll  touch upon that later. But let me first initially discuss our results. Strong pricing, cost reductions in our heritage business, coupled with continued synergy realization and profit contributions from the acquired businesses, drove record net sales and record earnings from operations as well as a 100 basis point expansion in our consolidated gross margin. The significantly improved gross margin in all heritage aggregates reportable segments lead to incremental gross margin contributions well above our stated objectives. Remarkably, these results were achieved despite those things we cannot control, principally, historic levels of rainfall throughout the United States and particularly in Texas. In short, we believe these weather patterns reduced second quarter consolidated gross profit by nearly $40 million.
We feel it's important that we provide some perspective on these weather challenges, not in an effort to simply state the obvious that indeed our second quarter results could have been stronger, but rather so you can more fully evaluate our results and get a clear picture of our earnings potential. That said, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, has tracked precipitation levels for 121 years. In that period, the second quarter of 2015 was the second wettest for the entire United States. Focusing solely on the state of Texas, NOAA reported the second quarter as well as the first 6 months of the year with the wettest ever recorded.
Contextually, Dallas, Houston and Austin experienced rainfall in May alone of 17, 14 and 17.5 inches, respectively. To put this amount of monthly rainfall in perspective, Washington Post reported that the water that flowed into Texas reservoirs alone, a tremendous 8 million acre feet, will be enough to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years.
Beyond Texas and the impact on the Southwest and cement divisions, 5 additional key states had their top 10 wettest second quarters ever recorded, impacting both sales and productivity in our Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Mideast divisions. We estimate nearly 3 million tons of aggregates, with 1.8 million tons in Texas alone, 450,000 cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete and 215,000 tons of cement shipments were deferred to later in the year and into 2016 as a result of weather.
Notwithstanding the significant weather impact during the first half of 2015, we believe underlying demand for our products remains strong driven by steady ongoing economic recovery, and we fully expect to capture the late business in the last half of the year and into 2016, assuming more normal weather patterns.
This morning's release also contained important strategic and shareholder value-enhancing developments related to our TXI acquisition. First, we were pleased to once again raise our annual synergy guidance to $120 million by the end of 2016, more than 70% above our initial estimate at the acquisition date [indiscernible] over a year ago. Second, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which we expect to close later this quarter. We intend to use the proceeds from this divestiture to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our program initiated during the second quarter.
Before we discuss second quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating and financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
To provide transparency into our second quarter results, I'll discuss the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and 2 other small aggregates product line transactions completed during the year's first quarter. While it's currently important to understand the results of heritage versus acquired operations, this comparison is becoming increasingly less meaningful as we successfully complete the integration of TXI operations into our heritage business. In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe doing so provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. In evaluating aggregating product line volume variances, it's important to note that the prior year second quarter includes shipments from 3 facilities in the West Group, a quarry in Oklahoma and 2 related sales distribution yards that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these 3 locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were down 3%, while shipments for the heritage aggregates business increased slightly. Both of these metrics were negatively impacted by excessive rainfall during the second quarter, meaningfully impacting the West Group and also the Mid-America Group.
Slide 4 presents gross margin by product line for acquired operations. In addition to the late shipments, profitability for these product lines was also negatively affected by weather, which resulted in lower production and efficiency levels.
Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market accounted for approximately 43% of total shipments and declined 3.6% compared with the prior year quarter. This decline is attributable to the impact of wet weather and to a lesser degree, uncertainty regarding the Federal Highway Trust Fund. We continue to see state-level funding initiatives come to fruition in numerous states, a sign of pent-up demand. Texas leads the nation in highway contract awards and expects to let [ph] nearly $7.5 billion in fiscal 2015.
In November, Texas voters will decide on proposition 7, a valid initiative that would dedicate an incremental $2.5 billion of revenue from the sales in use tax annually to the State Highway fund beginning September 1, 2017. Given our significant existing backlog, we anticipate the Texas infrastructure shipments to report growth over the next several years.
Major project activity is also accelerating in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with all 3 states along with Texas, being actively engaged in TIFIA-funded projects. Each of these states continues to be among the top states in the country for employment growth, catalyst for construction activity. Further, we believe the recently passed funding initiatives in Georgia and Iowa will have an meaningful long-term impact on infrastructure activity in both states.
Recently, both houses of Congress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution extending the provisions of the moving ahead for progress in the 21st Century act or MAP-21 through October 29, 2015. During this period of extended funding, we expect Congress to work toward passage of a new multiyear bill. There's broad bipartisan support and recognition of the importance of long-term investment in our nation's infrastructure. These include discussions between Congress and the White House evaluating whether a reduced income tax rate or other incentive for multinational companies to repatriate earnings could provide a source of funding for a long-term federal highway bill. We believe the senate's proposed 6-year highway bill will likely provide the framework for broader congressional debate following the August recess. We and others have long believed that the passage of a long-term infrastructure program for our nation is a top priority. It is gratifying to see the Congress and the President seemed to be moving along a path that will provide our citizens with legislation that will accomplish a goal that most Americans consider to be critical to our quality of life.
The nonresidential end-use market is comprised of 2 components, light and heavy. The light nonresidential component is primarily office and retail, and demand in this area is generally tied more directly to employment growth and residential demand. We expect light nonresidential-related volumes to continue to increase driven by improved economic fundamentals, which is coinciding with some of the reemergence speculative construction activity.
The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy. The heavy nonresidential end-use market represented 22% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and declined 11%. However, we believe this decline is driven in part by weather and expect to recoup the delayed volumes within 12 months.
As expected, shale energy-related volumes have declined versus the prior year quarter believe to be stabilized. We continue to expect energy-related construction activity to remain strong, notably among the Gulf Coast. As one example, the [indiscernible] Corpus Christi continues to prepare for long-term energy activity. Of note, a Ford official indicated the decline in oil prices has not reduced either the output of oil in Texas or the volumes transported via the port. Overall, United States crude oil production is projected to reach 9.5 million barrels per day in 2015 , an increase of 800,000 barrels per day over 2014 level.
In summary, we believe underlying nonresidential demand continues to strengthen as starts for the nation are up 12% over the trailing 12 months ended June 2015. Texas continues to lead the nation with growth of $6.5 billion or 19% for the same period. Additionally, nonbuilding construction activity, most notably related to liquefied natural gas products, is up over $30 billion nationally, including more than $18 billion in Texas.
The residential end-use market represented 16% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be relatively consistent with the trend in housing starts. Texas, Florida and Georgia lead the nation in single-family unit starts, each with nearly double-digit growth for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets for the second quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our second quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were down slightly, primarily related to excessive rainfall in Colorado and Iowa.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 7.6% over the prior year quarter, led by the West Group. We view this level of continued strength in aggregates product line pricing as an indication of underlying product demand and increased contract to Congress. Heritage aggregates product line total production costs were negatively affected by weather-related inefficiencies. resulting decrease in operating leverage led to a 3% increase in cost per ton shipped. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and on average paid $2.12 per gallon compared to $3.13 in the prior year quarter, resulting in a $9 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the heritage business.
The heritage aggregates related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3.5 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mixed concrete product line reported a 10% increase in average selling price.
Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $33 million and was 26% of net sales, an improvement of 530 basis points over the prior year quarter.
All reportable segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by an increase of 810 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement.
Our heritage Aggregates business generated an incremental gross margin of 214%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. We expect further economic recovery in the Southeastern United States to provide continued margin expansion.
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $60.5 million and a gross margin of 35.1%. For the quarter, the business' earnings from operations were $18.8 million, net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production and the timing of typical maintenance costs.
Slides 4 and 5 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the second quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of $36 million on external shipments of 2.8 million tons. Average selling price was $13.52 per ton, reflecting a product mix skewed by sand and gravel as well as rail yard shipment. The acquired ready-mixed concrete business shipped 1.1 million cubic yards during the quarter with an average selling price of $86.80. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected the business and reduced the profitability by an estimated $9 million.
The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. Second quarter operating results were also negatively affected by a wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year and into 2016. In the second quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers, an average selling price of $98.86 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $100 million. This has a achieved gross margin of over 30% after incurring almost $6 million of planned known maintenance costs. We announced price increases effective April 1. However, there is a lag time before we realize the full benefit.
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A expenses, was 6.7% of net sales, an increase of 60 basis points. This reflects the impact of weather-driven lower net sales and higher pension expense. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.
As detailed on Slide 6, our consolidated earnings from operations for the second quarter of $137 million improved more than $40 million from the prior year earnings of $96 million.
Our employees continue to work diligently on maximizing the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. In that regard, as previously noted, we now expect annual synergies to reach $120 million by the end of next year. Consistent with our integration plan, we completed the remaining systems integration for the cement and ready-mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, and I do want to thank our employees for their commitment to and patience with that process.
For the first half of the year, we generated $127 million of operating cash flow compared with $70 million for 2014, efficiently converting increased earnings into cash. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment including continued work on Medina limestone real quarry near San Antonio, the strategic project we believe will be substantially complete by year-end. Further, during the first half of the year, we returned $154 million to our shareholders, both through the repurchase of 670,000 shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Also our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015 is 2.4x, inn compliant with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.
In this morning's press release, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which is consistent with our strategic observations and timeframe when we acquired TXI. Our Oracle cement plant in Southern California is state-of-the-art the facility, operated by talented and committed workforce. However, the plant and its 2 related distribution terminals are neither proximate to other Martin Marietta core assets or complemented by downstream operations in California's traditionally vertically integrated marketplace. Thus, after careful consideration and evaluation, we determined the best avenue to maximize shareholder value is to sell these operations. The sales price is $420 million and, as previously mentioned, we intend to use the proceeds to repurchase additional shares of our common stock.
Looking ahead to our full year guidance, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and, importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate, fueling an emerging construction recovery.
In the second half of the year, we anticipate capturing a significant amount of weather-delayed shipments from the first half of the year. However, market capacity constraints will shift some of the delayed project activity into 2016. Accordingly, we modified our guidance to reflect this shift as well as the pending sale of the California cement operation. Currently, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 7% to 10% over 2014, with 3% to 5% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from full year of owning the TXI operation. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly compared to 2014.
On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $810 million to $850 million, with the change from prior quarter's guidance directly related to weather-deferred profitability and the planned California divestiture.
To conclude, we continue to be very excited about the future of Martin Marietta, which by virtually any measure, reflects a very positive growth trajectory. We believe the economy is in a construction-centric pace in both the residential and nonresidential sectors, and we also feel the prospects for multiyear transportation bill is greater this year than it has been for nearly a decade. Importantly, our company is well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities we see.
From a geographical and operational approach, we are poised to deliver high-quality products, which in turn, translates into increased revenues, profits and value for Martin Marietta and our investors. All the while we remain committed to our core foundational pillars: World-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, which, together, should lead to increased shareholder value.

Number one, pricing is falling right to the bottom line in many respects. So let's start with that notion. The other piece that I think is important is we are talking about an emerging recovery in Southeast right now. And we discussed in the past, in places like Georgia, saw 70% of their volume decline and North Carolina saw 50% of its volume decline. Volume coming back in those markets is very, very valuable, and we're looking at job rate recovery and growth right now, and we're seeing North Carolina and Georgia at the top 5 and top 7. That will drive volumes in those states. You have to remember, there was a day in an hour that we made $100 million in the Southeastern United States. And when we were making $100 million in the Southeastern United States, we didn't have that type of presence or geographical location that we do today. So Kathryn, to your point, pricing is helping. We are clearly seeing very good cost control in the heritage business and, yes, we are getting a from the Southeast coming back. To the other part of your question relative to what we're seeing relative to price increases, it's entirely consistent with what we've been discussing for the last several quarters. We said that you should expect the West to outpace the East for a while. That continues to be what we're seeing. Texas, we continue to see very nice double-digit price increases. That said, we are seeing double-digit price increases in Indiana. We are seeing double-digit price increases in Ohio. We are seeing double-digit price increases in portions of the Southeast as well. So we've got a good spread of price increases throughout our entire operation. That's something that again with volumes recovery and contract, we anticipated that we would see."

If you look at Florida, very positive, we're seeing all segments up, it's number 3 in job growth, which is really fueling construction. It's got a very strong DOD program. It's near record levels. The I-4 Ultimate job is very much underway. And again, only 25% of the funds in Florida come from federal government. So they've got a good strong program there. They are number 1 in res right now and number 3 in nonres. So all of that feels very good for Florida and our import business there. Georgia, we believe, is really starting to hit its stride. I mean, if we're looking at Georgia at number 5 in job growth, number 3 in res, number 10 in nonres, effectively a doubling of DOT construction in that state that candidly won't even really to start impact until 2016. But we are seeing the benefits of the program in South Georgia as well, which I think is a good precursor on what we'll see in the Northern part of the state. And what I would say on North Carolina and I think this is proportionately important is now we're seeing North Carolina recently as an up and comer newcomer. Think of it in these terms. Number 7 in employment. Number 51 in housing but number 10 in single-family housing. We're starting to see more single-family housing and more subdivision work in North Carolina. And number 18 in nonresidential. And then if I'm looking at DOT just over a trailing 12-month period, awards are up 29%. But here's something you can take away as well. We have a Republican Governor, House and Senate. And one of the biggest single fights that we have in North Carolina right now is how much more we're going to spend as a state on transportation. So your point looking at those Southeastern states and those 3 tend to be disproportionately important to us. That really is a strong driver for us. Does that answer your question?"

I think you've got a couple of things. One it has continued to slow. Weather has clearly affected it. If I had to sit here today and give you a sense of it, I think it will probably be somewhere between 4.5 million and 5 million tons of product going directly to the shale plays. So I think that's probably real. As we come back and answer the second half of your question relative to the large projects going on in South Texas, I would say several things in that regard. Number one, I think the LNG projects are clearly starting up. Report is now shipping -- near project will be next. We're looking at what we think those volumes may look like over a multiyear period, I could see over 1 million tons going to do that in the back half of this year. And just looking at what we see right now, I can see at least 0.5 million or more than 0.5 million per year really through 2019. If we're looking out what's going on there for a multiyear period, it looks pretty attractive. I mean, if we're looking at nonbuilding this period across the United States, it's up 30%. But it's overwhelmingly still driven by what we're seeing in Texas. Texas is up $18.5 billion and that's over half of the national increase. So we see something in that portion of nonres that continues to be helping and we think what we're seeing also in the office and retail, up 22% for the quarter, doing exactly what we thought. We believe that the portions of nonres that were going to be strong this year would overpower the weakness in shale. And we think that those 2 things coming together would simply lower energy prices, essentially pretty healthy mix for us right now."

The operational savings had gone up to around $86 million. And again, these are operational issues. It's what we're seeing combining Chico and Bridgeport. What we're seeing putting together, their former Mill Creek and our former Mill Creek. So the operation synergies that we saw when we came back in January were about $86 million.

So yes, it certainly would make an ASP on cement better without the California numbers in there. With respect to pricing, I guess I've got a couple of observations. Weather slowed everything down mile gain access and that we are looking at volumes, North Texas volumes for the quarter were down for us 22%. South Texas, they were down 18%. I think at that type of environment, we'd be looking for surprised increases later in the year. We'll certainly be looking for. I think it's a practical matter of that fact that price increases have done so far what they've done in that type of a weather challenge, volume environment is actually a very good story. We are more focused right now on going to be doing us pricing as we come early in 2016 as opposed to the latter part of 2015."

And you've often heard what I've said in the past and that is at a certain point as volume continues to grow more than that 5% basis, you should be able to see your percentage pricing and your percentage volume growth up and moving in some degree tandem together with pricing having a little bit of a lag.

That's almost a doubling of it. To give you a sense of it. Our quick math says $900 million of the spending consumes probably around 7 million tons of crushed stone. We've talked about how powerful incremental stone is in the market like that. But Florida has got just shy of a record DOT budget. Again, we've talked about the fact that North Carolina right now, with the Republican legislature and governor, is going through the process that our Senate would like to stop seeing funds diverted from a highway trust fund to the general fund. With several hundred million dollars a year more to North Carolina Highway, we're certainly a fan of that. Our governor would like to come back and borrow money at historically low rates it a couple of different issues out there on the ballot for later this fall. We'll see how all of that goes. But again, Iowa is a Republican straight, Nebraska is a Republican state, North Carolina is a Republican states and these are all states as is Texas with their prop 7 looking to put more money into the highways right now separate and distinct from what may happen on the federal side. One thing that I think we need to remember, too, Jerry, is if we get a highway bill, going to happen is we're going to see parts of the United States and in my view more rural areas add more highway money to spend. And I think that's going to be important one for economic development and number 2, some of the rural operations we have can be very profitable operations. And those operations throughout this downturn has suffered disproportionately. So I think the fact that DOT initiatives are really taking over at this stage level, and they're doing a lot of it for themselves, and we've got this great prospect I believe of getting highway bill this year, that's a 1 2 punch that could be notable."

And that's on the heels of 2 previous record budgets that goes back to my commentary when I said I can see volumes being very rest of it in Texas not just for this year and next but really for years out. Then when we're coming back and looking at the sheer level of nonres activity, continues to be there in the emerging presence now that we're seeing in office and retail in that state. And the continued mature housing market, it's there. And what I mean by that is we're seeing new subdivisions built. So Ted, that's simply going to be more aggregate intensive undertaking relative to residential than multifamily or otherwise. So what I would say is our outlook for volumes in Texas continues to be quite good, and we've been consistent that you should expect pricing in the West to generally outpace pricing in the East at least on a percentage basis. And I don't see anything right now that persuades me from that view."

The fact is you take that let's call it $53 million and come back with you, it's going to be impossible to make all of that up. And I think one of the issues that we've been faced with but I think the industry has been faced with in Texas. It if it rains for a while, it impacts your sales. If it rains for a long while, it impacts your sales and it impacts your production. And I think several things are happening. One, I think the logistics and supply chain is going to be really stretched in Texas for the rest of the year. And by that, I mean and people find enough trucking to get aggregates to locations, I think the short answer is going to be they can't. I think the other issue we talk a little bit about sand continue to be flooded right now, they've ability to become any really pressure product down to those that's the way that we would wish is going to be challenged as well. And I think the last piece of it is, can people even keep up with some of the clean stone requirements going forward. Now some of the good news for us is a lot of the work that we see both in North and South Texas can be relatively new work. So think about in these terms, I-35 and in North Texas and the Grand Parkway in South Texas, we're going to see more base going on those jobs for a while. So the clean stone needs won't be as acute, but they're still going to be pretty serious, particularly as we roll into next year. It's simply the inability of the industry to meet what I think the demand could be. The other issue is this, Ted, weather look like in Q4. If we have a good long fall, frankly like we did last year, we can probably cover a lot of that ground, but we're carrying on a more normal Q4 this year, so that's really what ticks down the EBITDA guidance."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, our second quarter results reflect continued solid performance and disciplined execution against stated objectives, controlling those things that we can and dealing effectively with those circumstances over which we have no control, such as extraordinary weather conditions. I'll  touch upon that later. But let me first initially discuss our results. Strong pricing, cost reductions in our heritage business, coupled with continued synergy realization and profit contributions from the acquired businesses, drove record net sales and record earnings from operations as well as a 100 basis point expansion in our consolidated gross margin. In fact, significantly improved gross margin in all heritage aggregates reportable segments led to incremental gross margin contributions well above our stated objectives. Remarkably, these results were achieved despite those things we cannot control, principally, historic levels of rainfall throughout the United States and particularly in Texas. In short, we believe these weather patterns reduced second quarter consolidated gross profit by nearly $40 million.
We feel it's important that we provide some perspective on these weather challenges, not in an effort to simply state the obvious that indeed our second quarter results could have been stronger, but rather so you can more fully evaluate our results and get a clear picture of our earnings potential. That said, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, has tracked precipitation levels for 121 years. With that period, the second quarter of 2015 was the second wettest for the entire United States. Focusing solely on the state of Texas, NOAA reported the second quarter as well as the first 6 months of the year with the wettest ever recorded.
Contextually, Dallas, Houston and Austin experienced rainfall in May alone of 17, 14 and 17.5 inches, respectively. To put this amount of monthly rainfall in perspective, the Washington Post reported that the water that flowed into Texas reservoirs alone, a tremendous 8 million acre feet, will be enough to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years.
Beyond Texas and the impact from the Southwest and cement divisions, 5 additional key states had their top 10 wettest second quarters ever recorded, impacting both sales and productivity in our Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Mideast divisions. We estimate nearly 3 million tons of aggregates, with 1.8 million tons in Texas alone, 450,000 cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete and 215,000 tons of cement shipments were deferred to later in the year and into 2016 as a result of weather.
Notwithstanding the significant weather impact during the first half of 2015, we believe underlying demand for our products remains strong driven by steady ongoing economic recovery, and we fully expect to capture the late business in the last half of the year and into 2016, assuming more normal weather patterns.
This morning's release also contained important strategic and shareholder value-enhancing developments related to our TXI acquisition. First, we were pleased to once again raise our annual synergy guidance to $120 million by the end of 2016, more than 70% above our initial estimate at the acquisition date of over a year ago. Second, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which we expect to close later this quarter. We intend to use the proceeds from this divestiture to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our program initiated during the second quarter.
Before we discuss second quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating and financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
To provide transparency into our second quarter results, I'll discuss the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and 2 other small aggregates product line transactions completed during the year's first quarter. While it's currently important to understand the results of heritage versus acquired operations, this comparison is becoming increasingly less meaningful as we successfully complete the integration of TXI operations into our heritage business.
In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe doing so provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. When evaluating aggregates product line volume variances, it's important to note that the prior year second quarter includes shipments from 3 facilities in the West Group: a quarry in Oklahoma and 2 related sales distribution yards that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these 3 locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were down 3%, while shipments for the heritage aggregates business increased slightly. Both of these metrics were negatively impacted by excessive rainfall during the second quarter, meaningfully impacting the West Group and also the Mid-America Group.
Slide 4 presents gross margin by product line for acquired operations. In addition to the late shipments, profitability for these product lines was also negatively affected by weather, which resulted in lower production and efficiency levels.
Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market accounted for approximately 43% of total shipments and declined 3.6% compared with the prior year quarter. This decline is attributable to the impact of wet weather and, to a lesser degree, uncertainty regarding the federal Highway Trust Fund. We continue to see state-level funding initiatives come to fruition in numerous states, a sign of pent-up demand. Texas leads the nation in highway contract awards and expects to let nearly $7.5 billion in fiscal 2015.
In November, Texas voters will decide on Proposition 7, a valid initiative that would dedicate an incremental $2.5 billion of revenue from the sales and use tax annually to the State Highway Fund beginning September 1, 2017. Given our significant existing backlog, we anticipate Texas infrastructure shipments to report growth over the next several years.
Major project activity is also accelerating in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with all 3 states along with Texas being actively engaged in TIFIA-funded projects. Each of these states continues to be among the top states in the country for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Further, we believe the recently passed funding initiatives in Georgia and Iowa will have a meaningful long-term impact on infrastructure activity in both states.
Recently, both Houses of Congress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution extending the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, through October 29, 2015. During this period of extended funding, we expect Congress to work toward passage of a new multiyear bill. There's broad bipartisan support and recognition of the importance of long-term investment in our nation's infrastructure. These include discussions between Congress and the White House, evaluating whether a reduced income tax rate or other incentive for multinational companies to repatriate earnings could provide a source of funding for a long-term federal highway bill. We believe the Senate's proposed six-year highway bill will likely provide the framework for broader congressional debate following the August recess. We and others have long believed that the passage of a long-term infrastructure program for our nation is a top priority. It's gratifying to see the Congress and the President seem to be moving along a path that will provide our citizens with legislation that will accomplish a goal that most Americans consider to be critical to our quality of life.
The nonresidential end-use market is comprised of 2 components: light and heavy. The light nonresidential component is primarily office and retail, and demand in this area is generally tied more directly to employment growth and residential demand. We expect light nonresidential-related volumes to continue to increase driven by improved economic fundamentals, which is coinciding with some of the reemergence of speculative construction activity.
The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy. The heavy nonresidential end-use market represented 22% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and declined 11%. However, we believe this decline is driven in part by weather and expect to recoup the delayed volumes within 12 months.
As expected, shale energy-related volumes have declined versus the prior year quarter but are believed to be stabilized. We continue to expect energy-related construction activity to remain strong, notably among the Gulf Coast. As one example, the Port of Corpus Christi continues to prepare for long-term energy activity. Of note, a port official indicated the decline in oil prices has not reduced either the output of oil in Texas or the volumes transported via the port. Overall, United States crude oil production is projected to reach 9.5 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of 800,000 barrels per day over 2014 level.
In summary, we believe underlying nonresidential demand continues to strengthen as starts for the nation are up 12% over the trailing 12 months ended June 2015. Texas continues to lead the nation with growth of $6.5 billion or 19% for the same period. Additionally, nonbuilding construction activity, most notably related to liquefied natural gas products, is up over $30 billion nationally, including more than $18 billion in Texas.
The residential end-use market represented 16% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be relatively consistent with the trend in housing starts. Texas, Florida and Georgia lead the nation in single-family unit starts, each with nearly double-digit growth for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets for the second quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our second quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were down slightly, primarily related to excessive rainfall in Colorado and Iowa.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 7.6% over the prior year quarter, led by the West Group. We view this level of continued strength in aggregates product line pricing as an indication of underlying product demand and increased contractor confidence. Heritage aggregates product line total production costs were negatively affected by weather-related inefficiencies. The resulting decrease in operating leverage led to a 3% increase in cost per ton shipped. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and on average paid $2.12 per gallon compared with $3.13 in the prior year quarter, resulting in a $9 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the heritage business.
The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3.5 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mixed concrete product line reported a 10% increase in average selling price.
Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $33 million and was 26% of net sales, an improvement of 530 basis points over the prior year quarter.
All reportable segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by an increase of 810 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement.
Our heritage aggregates business generated an incremental gross margin of 214%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. We expect further economic recovery in the Southeastern United States to provide continued margin expansion.
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $60.5 million and a gross margin of 35.1%. For the quarter, the business' earnings from operations were $18.8 million. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production and the timing of typical maintenance costs.
Slides 4 and 5 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the second quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of $36 million on external shipments of 2.8 million tons. Average selling price was $13.52 per ton, reflecting a product mix skewed by sand and gravel as well as rail yard shipment. The acquired ready-mixed concrete business shipped 1.1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $86.80. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected the business and reduced the profitability by an estimated $9 million.
The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. Second quarter operating results were also negatively affected by a wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year and into 2016. For the second quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $98.86 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $100 million. The business achieved gross margin of over 30% after incurring almost $6 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We announced price increases effective April 1. However, there is a lag time before we realize the full benefit.
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A expenses, was 6.7% of net sales, an increase of 60 basis points. This reflects the impact of weather-driven lower net sales and higher pension expense. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.
As detailed on Slide 6, our consolidated earnings from operations for the second quarter of $137 million improved more than $40 million from the prior year earnings of $96 million.
Our employees continue to work diligently on maximizing the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. In that regard, as previously noted, we now expect annual synergies to reach $120 million by the end of next year. Consistent with our integration plan, we completed the remaining systems integration for the cement and ready-mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, and I do want to thank our employees for their commitment to and patience with that process.
For the first half of the year, we generated $127 million of operating cash flow compared with $70 million for 2014, efficiently converting increased earnings into cash. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project, we believe, will be substantially complete by year-end.
Further, during the first half of the year, we returned $154 million to our shareholders, both through the repurchase of 670,000 shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015 was 2.4x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.
In this morning's press release, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which is consistent with our strategic observations and time frame when we acquired TXI. Our Oro Grande cement plant in Southern California is a state-of-the-art facility, operated by a talented and committed workforce. However, the plant and its 2 related distribution terminals are neither proximate to other Martin Marietta core assets nor complemented by downstream operations in California's traditionally vertically integrated marketplace. Thus, after careful consideration and evaluation, we determined the best avenue to maximize shareholder value is to sell these operations. The sales price is $420 million. And as previously mentioned, we intend to use the proceeds to repurchase additional shares of our common stock.
Looking ahead to our full year guidance, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and, importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate, fueling an emerging construction recovery.
During the second half of the year, we anticipate capturing a significant amount of weather-delayed shipments from the first half of the year. However, market capacity constraints will shift some of the delayed project activity into 2016. Accordingly, we modified our guidance to reflect this shift as well as the pending sale of the California cement operations. Currently, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 7% to 10% over 2014, with 3% to 5% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operation. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly compared to 2014.
On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $810 million to $850 million, with the change from prior quarter's guidance directly related to weather-deferred profitability and the planned California divestiture.
To conclude, we continue to be very excited about the future of Martin Marietta, which by virtually any measure reflects a very positive growth trajectory. We believe the economy is in a construction-centric phase in both the residential and nonresidential sectors, and we also feel the prospects for a multiyear transportation bill is greater this year than it has been for nearly a decade. Importantly, our company is well positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities we see.
From a geographical and operational approach, we're poised to deliver high-quality products, which in turn translates into increased revenues, profits and value for Martin Marietta and our investors. All the while, we remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, which together should lead to increased shareholder value.

Number one, pricing is falling right to the bottom line, in many respects. So let's start with that notion. The other piece that I think is important is we are talking about an emerging recovery in the Southeast right now. And we've discussed in the past, in places like Georgia, saw 70% of their volume decline and North Carolina saw 50% of its volume decline. Volume coming back in those markets is very, very powerful. When we're looking at job rate recovery and growth right now and we're seeing North Carolina and Georgia at the top 5 and top 7, that will drive volumes in those states. You have to remember, there was a day and an hour that we made $100 million in the Southeastern United States. And when we were making $100 million in the Southeastern United States, we didn't have the type of presence or geographical location that we do today. So Kathryn, to your point, pricing is helping. We are clearly seeing very good cost control in the heritage business. And yes, we are getting a mix help from the Southeast coming back. To the other part of your question relative to what we're seeing relative to price increases, it's entirely consistent with what we've been discussing for the last several quarters. We've said that you should expect the West to outpace the East for a while. That continues to be what we're seeing. Texas, we continue to see very nice double-digit price increases. That said, we're seeing double-digit price increases in Indiana. We're seeing double-digit price increases in Ohio. We're seeing double-digit price increases in portions of the Southeast as well. So we've got a good spread of price increases throughout our entire operation. That's something that again with volumes recovery and contractor confidence, we anticipate that, that we would see."

If you look at Florida, from where I'm sitting, it's very positive. We're seeing all segments up. It's #3 in job growth, which is really fueling construction. It's got a very strong DOT program. It's near record levels. The I-4 Ultimate job is very much underway. And again, only 25% of the funds in Florida come from federal government. So they've got a good, strong program there. They are #1 in res right now and #3 in nonres. So all of that feels very good for Florida and our import business there. Georgia, we believe, is really starting to hit its stride. I mean, if we're looking at Georgia at #5 in job growth, #3 in res, #10 in nonres, effectively a doubling of DOT construction in that state that candidly won't even really start to impact it until 2016. But we are seeing the benefits of the east-west program in South Georgia as well, which I think is a good precursor on what we'll see in the northern parts of the state. And what I would say on North Carolina, and I think this is disproportionately important, is now we're seeing North Carolina really as an up-and-comer. I mean, think of it in these terms: #7 in employment, #51 in housing but #10 in single-family housing. We're starting to see more single-family housing and more subdivision work in North Carolina; and #18 in nonresidential. And then if I'm looking at DOT just over a trailing 12-month period, awards are up 29%. But here's something you can take away as well. We have a Republican Governor, House and Senate. And one of the biggest single fights that we have in North Carolina right now is how much more we're going to spend as a state on transportation. So to your point, looking at those Southeastern states, those 3 tend to be disproportionately important to us. That really is a strong driver for us. Does that answer your question?"

I think you've got a couple of things. One it has continued to slow. Weather has clearly affected it. If I had to sit here today and give you a sense of it, I think it will probably be somewhere between 4.5 million and 5 million tons of product going directly to the shale plays. So I think that's probably real. As we come back and answer the second half of your question relative to the large projects going on in South Texas, I guess, I would say several things in that regard. Number one, I think the LNG projects are clearly starting up. Freeport is now shipping. The Cheniere near project will be next. If we're looking at what we think those volumes may look like over a multiyear period, I mean, I could see over 1 million tons going to that in the back half of this year. And just looking at what we see right now, I can see at least 0.5 million or more than 0.5 million per year really through 2019. So again, if we're looking at what's going on there for a multiyear period, it looks pretty attractive. I mean, if we're looking at nonbuilding this period across the United States, it's up 30%. But it's overwhelmingly still driven by what we're seeing in Texas. So texas is up $18.5 billion, and that's over half of the national increase. So we see something in that portion of nonres that continues to be helping. And we think what we're seeing also in office and retail, up 22% for the quarter, doing exactly what we thought. We believe that the portions of nonres that were going to be strong this year would overpower the weakness in shale. And we think that those 2 things coming together with simply lower energy pricing is actually a pretty healthy mix for us right now."

It was also up 17% in California. Now there is a bogey between those 2 numbers. So if you're looking at Texas pricing, for us, 102 85 and California pricing at 89 45, I mean, that pretty much gives you the mix on how that's going to look. So yes, it certainly would make an ASP on cement better without the California numbers in there. With respect to pricing, I guess, I've got a couple of observations. Weather slowed everything down mildly in Texas, and they're neither 2. If we're looking at volumes, North Texas volumes for the quarter were down for us 22%. South Texas, they were down 18%. I think at that type of environment, will we be looking for some price increases later in the year? We'll certainly be looking for it. I think it's a practical matter. The fact that price increases have done so far what they've done in that type of a weather-challenged volume environment is actually a very good story. We're more focused right now on what we're going to be doing with pricing as we come out early in 2016 as opposed to the latter part of 2015."

For example, we have seen that very specifically in portions of the Southeast. We've seen that and very, very specifically in portions of the Southwest. But other places, we're seeing it on a job-by-job, bid-by-bid basis, again preparing not just for the second half of the year, but preparing as we go into next year.

I'm just giving you what Dodge is saying. But Dodge is seeing total construction up in 2016 12%. It's seeing nonres up 11%. It's seeing residential up 20%. And you've often heard what I've said in the past and that is at a certain point as volume continues to grow more than that 5% basis, you should be able to see your percentage pricing and your percentage volume growth linked up and moving in some degree in tandem together with pricing having a little bit of a lag. So I've tried to answer your question relative to what we're seeing on a division-by-division basis, how we're going about it and also at least what people who do forecasting for a living like F.W.

That's almost a doubling of it. To give you a sense of it, our quick math says $900 million of new spending consumes probably around 7 million tons of crushed stone. We've talked about how powerful incremental stone is in the market like that. Florida has got just shy of a record DOT budget. Again, we've talked about the fact that North Carolina right now with a Republican legislature and governor is going through the process that our Senate would like to stop seeing funds diverted from a Highway Trust Fund to the general fund, with several hundred million dollars a year more to North Carolina highway, we're certainly a fan of that. Our governor would like to come back and borrow money at historically low rates with a couple of different bond issues out there on the ballot for later this fall. We'll see how all of that goes. But again, Iowa is a Republican state. Nebraska is a Republican state. North Carolina is a Republican state. And these are all states, as is Texas with their Prop 7, looking to put more money into highways right now, separate and distinct from what may happen on the federal side. One thing that I think we need to remember, too, Jerry, is if we get a highway bill, part of what's going to happen is we're going to see parts of the United States and, in my view, more rural areas add more highway money to spend. And I think that's going to be important, one, for economic development; and number two, some of the rural operations we have can be very profitable operations. And those are the operations throughout this down term that has suffered disproportionately. So I think the fact that DOT initiatives are really taking over at the state level and they're doing a lot of it for themselves and we've got this great prospect I believe of getting a highway bill this year, that's a one-two punch that could be notable."

Then when we're coming back and looking at the sheer level of nonres activity, it continues to be there in the emerging presence now that we're seeing in office and retail in that state. And the continued mature housing market, it's there. And what I mean by that is we're seeing new subdivisions built. So Ted, that's simply going to be a more aggregate-intensive undertaking relative to residential than multifamily or otherwise. So what I would say is our outlook for volumes in Texas continues to be quite good, and we've been consistent that you should expect pricing in the West to generally outpace pricing in the East at least on a percentage basis. And I don't see anything right now that dissuades me from that view."

And I think one of the issues that we've been faced with but I think the industry has been faced with in Texas, if it rains for a while, it impacts your sales. If it rains for a long while, it impacts your sales and it impacts your production. And I think several things are happening. One, I think the logistics and supply chain is going to be really stretched in Texas for the rest of the year. And by that, I mean, can people find enough trucking to get aggregates to locations? I think the short answer is going to be they can't. I think the other issue we've talked a little bit about is sand plastics continue to be flooded right now. The ability to come and really push product out of those sites the way that we would wish is going to be challenged as well. And I think the last piece of it is, can people even keep up with some of the clean stone requirements going forward. Now some of the good news for us is a lot of the work that we see both in North and South Texas can be relatively new work. So think about in these terms, I-35 in North Texas and The Grand Parkway in South Texas, we're going to see more base going on those jobs for a while. So the clean stone needs won't be as acute, but they're still going to be pretty serious, particularly as we roll into next year. It's simply the inability of the industry to meet what I think the demand could be. The other issue is this, Ted, what's weather going to look like in Q4? If we have a good long fall, frankly, like we did last year, we can probably cover a lot of that ground. But we're carrying on a more normal Q4 this year, so that's really what takes down the EBITDA guidance."

Again, if we go back to what we're seeing, too, in nonbuilding, the nonbuilding activity is pretty strong.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As announced in this morning's release, our second quarter results reflect continued solid performance and disciplined execution against stated objectives, controlling those things that we can and dealing effectively with those circumstances over which we have no control, such as extraordinary weather conditions. I’ll touch upon that later. But let me first initially discuss our results. Strong pricing, cost reductions in our heritage business, coupled with continued synergy realization and profit contributions from the acquired businesses, drove record net sales and record earnings from operations as well as a 100 basis point expansion in our consolidated gross margin. In fact, significantly improved gross margin in all heritage aggregates reportable segments led to incremental gross margin contributions well above our stated objectives. Remarkably, these results were achieved despite those things we cannot control, principally, historic levels of rainfall throughout the United States and particularly in Texas. In short, we believe these weather patterns reduced second quarter consolidated gross profit by nearly $40 million.
We feel it's important that we provide some perspective on these weather challenges, not in an effort to simply state the obvious that indeed our second quarter results could have been stronger, but rather so you can more fully evaluate our results and get a clear picture of our earnings potential. That said, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, has tracked precipitation levels for 121 years. For that period, the second quarter of 2015 was the second wettest for the entire United States. Focusing solely on the state of Texas, NOAA reported the second quarter, as well as the first 6 months of the year, were the wettest ever recorded.
Contextually, Dallas, Houston and Austin experienced rainfall in May alone of 17, 14 and 17.5 inches, respectively. To put this amount of monthly rainfall in perspective, the Washington Post reported that the water that flowed into Texas reservoirs alone, a tremendous 8 million acre feet, would be enough to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years.
Beyond Texas and the impact on the Southwest in cement divisions, 5 additional key states had their top 10 wettest second quarters ever recorded, impacting both sales and productivity in our Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Mideast divisions. We estimate nearly 3 million tons of aggregates, with 1.8 million tons in Texas alone, 450,000 cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete and 215,000 tons of cement shipments were deferred to later in the year and into 2016 as a result of weather.
Notwithstanding the significant weather impact during the first half of 2015, we believe underlying demand for our products remains strong driven by steady ongoing economic recovery, and we fully expect to capture the late business in the last half of the year and into 2016, assuming more normal weather patterns.
This morning's release also contained important strategic and shareholder value-enhancing developments related to our TXI acquisition. First, we were pleased to once again raise our annual synergy guidance to $120 million by the end of 2016, more than 70% above our initial estimate at the acquisition date of a little over a year ago. Second, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which we expect to close later this quarter. We intend to use the proceeds from this divestiture to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our program initiated during the second quarter.
Before we discuss second quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating and financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
To provide transparency into our second quarter results, I'll discuss the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and 2 other small aggregates product line transactions completed during the year's first quarter. While it's currently important to understand the results of heritage versus acquired operations, this comparison is becoming increasingly less meaningful as we successfully complete the integration of TXI operations into our heritage business.
In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website, supplemental financial information. We believe doing so provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.
Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. When evaluating aggregates product line volume variances, it's important to note that the prior year second quarter includes shipments from 3 facilities in the West Group: a quarry in Oklahoma and 2 related sales distribution yards that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these 3 locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were down 3%, while shipments for the heritage aggregates business increased slightly. Both of these metrics were negatively impacted by excessive rainfall during the second quarter, meaningfully impacting the West Group and also the Mid-America Group.
Slide 4 presents gross margin by product line for acquired operations. In addition to the late shipments, profitability for these product lines was also negatively affected by weather, which resulted in lower production and efficiency levels.
Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market accounted for approximately 43% of total shipments and declined 3.6% compared with the prior year quarter. This decline is attributable to the impact of wet weather and, to a lesser degree, uncertainty regarding the federal Highway Trust Fund. We continue to see state-level funding initiatives come to fruition in numerous states, a sign of pent-up demand. Texas leads the nation in highway contract awards and expects to let nearly $7.5 billion in fiscal 2015.
In November, Texas voters will decide on Proposition 7, a ballot initiative that would dedicate an incremental $2.5 billion of revenue from the sales and use tax annually to the State Highway Fund beginning September 1, 2017. Given our significant existing backlog, we anticipate Texas infrastructure shipments to report growth over the next several years.
Major project activity is also accelerating in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with all 3 states along with Texas being actively engaged in TIFIA-funded projects. Each of these states continues to be among the top states in the country for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Further, we believe the recently passed funding initiatives in Georgia and Iowa will have a meaningful long-term impact on infrastructure activity in both states.
Recently, both Houses of Congress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution extending the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, through October 29, 2015. During this period of extended funding, we expect Congress to work toward passage of a new multiyear bill. There's broad bipartisan support and recognition of the importance of long-term investment in our nation's infrastructure. These include discussions between Congress and the White House, evaluating whether a reduced income tax rate or other incentive for multinational companies to repatriate earnings could provide a source of funding for a long-term federal highway bill. We believe the Senate's proposed six-year highway bill will likely provide the framework for broader congressional debate following the August recess. We and others have long believed that the passage of a long-term infrastructure program for our nation is a top priority. It's gratifying to see the Congress and the President seem to be moving along a path that will provide our citizens with legislation that will accomplish a goal that most Americans consider to be critical to our quality of life.
The nonresidential end-use market is comprised of 2 components: light and heavy. The light nonresidential component is primarily office and retail, and demand in this area is generally tied more directly to employment growth and residential demand. We expect light nonresidential-related volumes to continue to increase driven by improved economic fundamentals, which is coinciding with some of the reemergence of speculative construction activity.
The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy. The heavy nonresidential end-use market represented 22% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and declined 11%. However, we believe this decline is driven in part by weather and expect to recoup the delayed volumes within 12 months.
As expected, shale energy-related volumes have declined versus the prior year quarter but are believed to be stabilized. We continue to expect energy-related construction activity to remain strong, notably along the Gulf Coast. As one example, the Port of Corpus Christi continues to prepare for long-term energy activity. Of note, a port official indicated the decline in oil prices has not reduced either the output of oil in Texas or the volumes transported via the port. Overall, United States crude oil production is projected to reach 9.5 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of 800,000 barrels per day over 2014 level.
In summary, we believe underlying nonresidential demand continues to strengthen as starts for the nation are up 12% over the trailing 12 months ended June 2015. Texas continues to lead the nation with growth of $6.5 billion or 19% for the same period. Additionally, nonbuilding construction activity, most notably related to liquefied natural gas products, is up over $30 billion nationally, including more than $18 billion in Texas.
The residential end-use market represented 16% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be relatively consistent with the trend in housing starts. Texas, Florida and Georgia lead the nation in single-family unit starts, each with nearly double-digit growth for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets for the second quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our second quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were down slightly, primarily related to excessive rainfall in Colorado and Iowa.
Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 7.6% over the prior year quarter, led by the West Group. We view this level of continued strength in aggregates product line pricing as an indication of underlying product demand and increased contractor confidence. Heritage aggregates product line total production costs were negatively affected by weather-related inefficiencies. The resulting decrease in operating leverage led to a 3% increase in cost per ton shipped. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and on average paid $2.12 per gallon compared with $3.13 in the prior year quarter, resulting in a $9 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the heritage business.
The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3.5 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mixed concrete product line reported a 10% increase in average selling price.
Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $33 million and was 26% of net sales, an improvement of 530 basis points over the prior year quarter.
All reportable segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by an increase of 810 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement.
Our heritage aggregates business generated an incremental gross margin of 214%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. We expect further economic recovery in the Southeastern United States to provide continued margin expansion.
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $60.5 million and a gross margin of 35.1%. For the quarter, the business' earnings from operations were $18.8 million. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production and the timing of typical maintenance costs.
Slides 4 and 5 provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the second quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of $36 million on external shipments of 2.8 million tons. Average selling price was $13.52 per ton, reflecting a product mix skewed by sand and gravel as well as rail yard shipment. The acquired ready-mixed concrete business shipped 1.1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $86.80. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected the business and reduced the profitability by an estimated $9 million.
The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. Second quarter operating results were also negatively affected by a wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year and into 2016. For the second quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $98.86 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $100 million. The business achieved a gross margin of over 30% after incurring almost $6 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We announced price increases effective April 1. However, there is a lag time before we realize the full benefit.
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A expenses, was 6.7% of net sales, an increase of 60 basis points. This reflects the impact of weather-driven lower net sales and higher pension expense. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.
As detailed on Slide 6, our consolidated earnings from operations for the second quarter of $137 million improved more than $40 million from the prior year earnings of $96 million.
Our employees continue to work diligently on maximizing the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. In that regard, as previously noted, we now expect annual synergies to reach $120 million by the end of next year. Consistent with our integration plan, we completed the remaining systems integration for the cement and ready-mix concrete businesses during the second quarter, and I do want to thank our employees for their commitment to and patience with that process.
For the first half of the year, we generated $127 million of operating cash flow compared with $70 million for 2014, efficiently converting increased earnings into cash. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project we believe will be substantially complete by year-end.
Further, during the first half of the year, we returned $154 million to our shareholders, both through the repurchase of 670,000 shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015 was 2.4x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.
In this morning's press release, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which is consistent with our strategic observations and time frame when we acquired TXI. Our Oro Grande cement plant in Southern California is a state-of-the-art facility, operated by a talented and committed workforce. However, the plant and its 2 related distribution terminals are neither proximate to other Martin Marietta core assets nor complemented by downstream operations in California's traditionally vertically integrated marketplace. Thus, after careful consideration and evaluation, we determined the best avenue to maximize shareholder value is to sell these operations. The sales price is $420 million and as previously mentioned, we intend to use the proceeds to repurchase additional shares of our common stock.
Looking ahead to our full year guidance, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and, importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate, fueling an emerging construction recovery.
During the second half of the year, we anticipate capturing a significant amount of weather-delayed shipments from the first half of the year. However, market capacity constraints will shift some of the delayed project activity into 2016. Accordingly, we modified our guidance to reflect this shift as well as the pending sale of the California cement operations. Currently, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 7% to 10% over 2014, with 3% to 5% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operation. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly compared to 2014.
On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $810 million to $850 million, with the change from prior quarter's guidance directly related to weather-deferred profitability and the planned California divestiture.
To conclude, we continue to be very excited about the future of Martin Marietta, which by virtually any measure reflects a very positive growth trajectory. We believe the economy is in a construction-centric phase in both the residential and nonresidential sectors, and we also feel the prospects for a multiyear transportation bill is greater this year than it has been for nearly a decade. Importantly, our company is well positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities we see.
From a geographical and operational approach, we're poised to deliver high-quality products, which in turn translates into increased revenues, profits and value for Martin Marietta and our investors. All the while, we remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, which together should lead to increased shareholder value.
If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions."

Number one, pricing is falling right to the bottom line, in many respects. So let's start with that notion. The other piece that I think is important is we are talking about an emerging recovery in the Southeast right now. And we've discussed in the past, in places like Georgia, saw 70% of their volume decline and North Carolina saw 50% of its volume decline. Volume coming back in those markets is very, very powerful. When we're looking at job rate recovery and growth right now and we're seeing North Carolina and Georgia in the top 5 and top 7, that will drive volumes in those states. You have to remember, there was a day and an hour that we made $100 million in the Southeastern United States. And when we were making $100 million in the Southeastern United States, we didn't have the type of presence or geographical location that we do today. So Kathryn, to your point, pricing is helping. We are clearly seeing very good cost control in the heritage business. And yes, we are getting a mix help from the Southeast coming back. To the other part of your question relative to what we're seeing relative to price increases, it's entirely consistent with what we've been discussing for the last several quarters. We've said that you should expect the West to outpace the East for a while. That continues to be what we're seeing. Texas, we continue to see very nice double-digit price increases. That said, we're seeing double-digit price increases in Indiana. We're seeing double-digit price increases in Ohio. We're seeing double-digit price increases in portions of the Southeast as well. So we've got a good spread of price increases throughout our entire operation. That's something that, again, with volumes recovering and contractor confidence, we anticipated that we would see."

If you look at Florida, from where I'm sitting, it's very positive. We're seeing all segments up. It's #3 in job growth, which is really fueling construction. It's got a very strong DOT program. It's near record levels. The I-4 Ultimate job is very much underway. And again, only 25% of the funds in Florida come from federal government. So they've got a good, strong program there. They are #1 in res right now and #3 in nonres. So all of that feels very good for Florida and our import business there. Georgia, we believe, is really starting to hit its stride. I mean, if we're looking at Georgia at #5 in job growth, #3 in res, #10 in nonres, effectively a doubling of DOT construction in that state that candidly won't even really start to impact it until 2016. But we are seeing the benefits of the T-SPLOST program in South Georgia as well, which I think is a good precursor on what we'll see in the northern parts of the state. And what I would say on North Carolina, and I think this is disproportionately important, is now we're seeing North Carolina really as an up-and-comer. I mean, think of it in these terms: #7 in employment, #51 in housing but #10 in single-family housing. We're starting to see more single-family housing and more subdivision work in North Carolina; and #18 in nonresidential. And then if I'm looking at DOT just over a trailing 12-month period, awards are up 29%. But here's something you can take away as well. We have a Republican Governor, House and Senate. And one of the biggest single fights that we have in North Carolina right now is how much more we're going to spend as a state on transportation. So to your point, looking at those Southeastern states and those 3 tend to be disproportionately important to us, that really is a strong driver for us. Does that answer your question?"

When we spoke at the end of Q1, we said we thought it would look a lot like it looked in 2012, which was about a 7 million ton level as opposed to about -- I mean, a 6 million ton level as opposed to 7.5 million last year. I think you've got a couple of things. One it has continued to slow. Weather has clearly affected it. If I had to sit here today and give you a sense of it, I think it will probably be somewhere between 4.5 million and 5 million tons of product going directly to the shale plays. So I think that's probably real. As we come back and answer the second half of your question relative to the large projects going on in South Texas, I guess, I would say several things in that regard. Number one, I think the LNG projects are clearly starting up. Freeport is now shipping. The Cheniere near project will be next. If we're looking at what we think those volumes may look like over a multiyear period, I mean, I could see over 1 million tons going to that in the back half of this year. And just looking at what we see right now, I can see at least 0.5 million or more than 0.5 million per year really through 2019. So again, if we're looking at what's going on there for a multiyear period, it looks pretty attractive. I mean, if we're looking at nonbuilding this period across the United States, it's up 30%. But it's overwhelmingly still driven by what we're seeing in Texas. So Texas is up $18.5 billion, and that's over half of the national increase. So we see something in that portion of nonres that continues to be helping. And we think what we're seeing also in office and retail, up 22% for the quarter, doing exactly what we thought. We believed that the portions of nonres that were going to be strong this year would overpower the weakness in shale. And we think that those 2 things coming together, with simply lower energy pricing, is actually a pretty healthy mix for us right now."

It was also up 17% in California. Now there is a bogey between those 2 numbers. So if you're looking at Texas pricing, for us, at 102 85 and California pricing at 89 45, I mean, that pretty much gives you the mix on how that's going to look. So yes, it certainly would make an ASP on cement better without the California numbers in there. With respect to pricing, I guess, I've got a couple of observations. Weather slowed everything down mightily in Texas, and you know that and I do too, if we're looking at volumes, North Texas volumes for the quarter were down for us 22%. South Texas, they were down 18%. I think in that type of environment, will we be looking for some price increases later in the year? We'll certainly be looking for it, I think it's a practical matter. The fact that price increases have done so far what they've done in that type of a weather-challenged volume environment is actually a very good story. We're more focused right now on what we're going to be doing with pricing as we come out early in 2016 as opposed to the latter part of 2015."

But other places, we're seeing it on a job-by-job, bid-by-bid basis, again preparing, not just for the second half of the year, but preparing as we go into next year.

But Dodge is seeing total construction up in 2016 12%. It's seeing nonres up 11%. It's seeing residential up 20%. And you've often heard what I've said in the past and that is at a certain point, as volume continues to grow more than that 5% basis, you should be able to see your percentage pricing and your percentage volume growth linked up and moving in some degree in tandem together with the pricing having a little bit of a lag. So I've tried to answer your question relative to what we're seeing on a division-by-division basis, how we're going about it and also at least what people who do forecasting for a living, like F.W. Dodge, are saying about next year and how that's going to relate to pricing. I hope that helps."

That's going to put another $215 million annually and what they're doing, that's about a 30% increase. Again, Georgia is coming back, adding almost $1 billion to their DOT budget. That's almost a doubling of it. To give you a sense of it, our quick math says $900 million of new spending consumes probably around 7 million tons of crushed stone. We've talked about how powerful incremental stone is in the market like that. Florida has got just shy of a record DOT budget. Again, we've talked about the fact that North Carolina right now, with a Republican legislature and governor, is going through the process that our Senate would like to stop seeing funds diverted from a Highway Trust Fund to the general fund, with several hundred million dollars a year more to North Carolina highway. We're certainly a fan of that. Our governor would like to come back and borrow money at historically low rates with a couple of different bond issues out there on the ballot for later this fall. We'll see how all of that goes. But again, Iowa is a Republican state. Nebraska is a Republican state. North Carolina is a Republican state. And these are all states, as is Texas, with their Prop 7, looking to put more money into highways right now, separate and distinct from what may happen on the federal side. One thing that I think we need to remember, too, Jerry, is if we get a highway bill, part of what's going to happen is we're going to see parts of the United States and, in my view more rural areas, have more highway money to spend. And I think that's going to be important, one, for economic development; and number two, some of the rural operations we have can be very profitable operations. And those are the operations throughout this downturn that has suffered disproportionately. So I think the fact that DOT initiatives are really taking over at the state level and they're doing a lot of it for themselves and we've got this great prospect, I believe, of getting a highway bill this year, that's a one-two punch that could be notable."

So if you look at reported volumes in the West Group, take out the divested assets that we -- that divested of last year but are still included in the numbers and look at the impact of the rain or the weather-deferred shipments in the West Group, adjusting for all those items, our volumes would have been up about 11%. Those 2 things together add up to about 3.1 million tons."

Then when we're coming back and looking at the sheer level of nonres activity that continues to be there and the emerging presence now that we're seeing in office and retail in that state. And the continued mature housing market that's there. And what I mean by that is we're seeing new subdivisions built. So Ted, that's simply going to be a more aggregate-intensive undertaking relative to residential than multifamily or otherwise. So what I would say is our outlook for volumes in Texas continues to be quite good, and we've been consistent that you should expect pricing in the West to generally outpace pricing in the East, at least on a percentage basis. And I don't see anything right now that dissuades me from that view."

And I think one of the issues that we've been faced with but I think the industry has been faced with in Texas, if it rains for a while, it impacts your sales. If it rains for a long while, it impacts your sales and it impacts your production. And I think several things are happening. One, I think the logistics and supply chain is going to be really stretched in Texas for the rest of the year. And by that, I mean, can people find enough trucking to get aggregates to locations? I think the short answer is going to be they can't. I think the other issue we've talked a little bit about is sand plants that continue to be flooded right now. The ability to come and really push product out of those sites the way that we would wish is going to be challenged as well. And I think the last piece of it is, can people even keep up with some of the clean stone requirements going forward. Now some of the good news for us is a lot of the work that we see both in North and South Texas can be relatively new work. So think about in these terms, I-35 in North Texas and The Grand Parkway in South Texas, we're going to see more base going on those jobs for a while. So the clean stone needs won't be as acute, but they're still going to be pretty serious, particularly as we roll into next year. It's simply the inability of the industry to meet what I think the demand could be. The other issue is this, Ted, what's weather going to look like in Q4? If we have a good long fall, frankly, like we did last year, we can probably cover a lot of that ground. But we're carrying on a more normal Q4 this year, so that's really what takes down the EBITDA guidance."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
By any measure, this was an outstanding quarter for us. We reported record net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Our performance in the third quarter reflects some basic realities about today's Martin Marietta, namely, the growing demand for construction materials, coupled with our operational excellence and synergy realization, has enabled us to generate net sales that exceeded $1 billion, a milestone for us, as well as achieve our stated incremental margin objective by delivering $0.77 of gross profit on each incremental dollar of net sales over the prior year quarter.
Further to that point, we believe that we are in the beginning stages of a construction-centric recovery that's taking place in our country and, most importantly for us, in those markets we serve. As a result, we see further opportunities to increase our sales, profits and cash flow in the coming months and even years.
The past quarter also saw us complete the sale of our California cement operations in a cash transaction of $420 million. In anticipation of the proceeds from the sale, we repurchased $158 million of our common stock during the third quarter, giving us the opportunity to further enhance shareholder value. We anticipate returning the remaining net proceeds to shareholders with additional stock repurchases throughout the remainder of the year.
Before we discuss third quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe this provides meaningful data to better analyze our third quarter performance. Let me briefly summarize the supplemental information. 
Slide 2 provides comparative net sales and gross profit, which helps illustrate our profit trajectory. Slides 3 and 4 provide product line volume and pricing metrics. We are pleased to report solid growth in each product line. Finally, Slide 5, provides a roll forward of our earnings from operations.
Now let's delve into some of the underlying details that support these metrics. Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market account for approximately 43% of total volumes and increased more than 5% compared with the prior-year quarter. We are encouraged to see states take increased responsibility for funding infrastructure investment. In fact, highway awards for the trailing 12 months through July were their highest levels since 2000, with major project activity continuing to accelerate in the Southeastern United States and Texas.
Additionally, today, voters in Texas are expected to pass Proposition 7, a valid initiative that would dedicate an additional $2.5 billion annually for nontollroad projects beginning in 2017.
Last week, federal highway funding was extended to November 20 with the passage of the 35th short-term patch since 2008. The roughly 3-week duration of this continuing resolution increases our optimism regarding the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill this year, a move that has bipartisan support in Congress, in which the President has indicated his willingness to side. To that effect, on October 18, Congressman Bill, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, introduced the $325 billion surface transportation reauthorization and reformat. This means that together with the Senate's previously announced Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy Act, or DRIVE, for the first time in over a decade, both chambers of congress are readying to advance multiyear federal highway bills. Should a federal highway bill be passed before the end of the year, any meaningful impact on our business would not be expected prior to the second half of 2016. But clearly, its positive impact will be felt for several years thereafter.
The nonresidential end-use market is comprised of 2 components, light construction and heavy construction. The light nonresidential construction component is primarily office and retail, with demand that generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with these drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volume increased 29%. Importantly, each reportable group achieved double-digit growth in this component of construction, with the largest percentage increase being reported in the Southeast division. Light nonresidential shipments are benefiting from low energy prices and years of steady employment growth. In fact, nonfarm employment in the United States is currently about 4 million jobs above the prerecession peak.
The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 21% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and declined 9% compared with the third quarter of 2014. As expected, shale energy-related volumes were down versus the prior-year quarter. However, we expect large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects during the remainder of the year and early 2016 to offset the decline in direct shale exploration activity.
Despite the reduction in shale-related shipments, domestic crude oil production is projected to reach 9.25 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of more than 500,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels, all evidence of continuing energy sector transformation in the United States.
Nonresidential construction activity continues to vary by location. Texas again lead the nation with more than $24 billion of starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015. Significant job growth -- significant growth is also being experienced in key Southeastern states, including Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Our leading positions in these markets should allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.
The residential end-use market represented 18% of aggregates shipments and increased 15% compared with prior-year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be in line with the trend in housing starts. Texas leads the nation in single-family unit starts, while Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina each rank in the top 10 in growth for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015.
Finally, to conclude with a discussion of end-use markets for the third quarter, the ChemRock/Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our third quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were up 7%, attributable to increased railroad ballast shipment, which in part are driven by deferred maintenance from prior years when rail congestion and weather tendered such activity.
Aggregates product line pricing increased in all reportable groups led by the West Group, consistent with our stated expectations. Overall, we achieved a 5% increase.
Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped was down slightly, with lower energy prices benefiting the cost structure. On average, we paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.09 in the prior-year quarter, contributing to an $11 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the entire company. During the first 9 months of the year, we've recognized a total of $16 million in diesel fuel savings despite a 22% increase in consumption driven by economic growth and in the TXI acquisition.
The aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by almost $13 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mixed concrete product line reported a 19% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average selling price.
Gross profit for the Aggregates business increased $60 million and resulted in a gross margin increase of 500 basis points over the prior year quarter to 25.3% of net sales. In fact, we are very pleased to note that all of our reportable business segments extended their respective gross margin, led by a 780 basis point increase in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. We expect further recovery to provide opportunities to expand profitability towards historical levels for the Southeast Group.
Overall, our Aggregates business exceeded our publicly stated target and generated an incremental gross margin of 68%.
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $57 million and a gross margin of 34%. For the quarter, the business' earnings from operations were $17 million, a slight decline compared with the prior year. Net sales in earnings were negatively affected by decline in domestic steel production.
Our third quarter cement business results are impressive. Gross profit increased $14 million as the 16% increase in average selling price to nearly $100 per ton and synergy realization more than offset volume declines. Gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points to 34.5%. For the quarter, the business incurred almost $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs, which, as expected, will likely double in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the cement business shipped 1.1 million tons to external customers. Over 70% or 138,000 tons of the decline in cement shipments during the quarter resulted from the sale of the California cement business. Upon announcement of the sale of that business, as expected, certain customers realigned their volumes to other suppliers. Excluding the California sale impact, cement shipments declined 4%, with half resulting from a loss of direct shipments to the energy sector and the other half from the well-publicized introduction of new cement capacity in Texas. We remain diligent in achieving margin growth through a disciplined price structure. The aim is, as ever, to increase profitability and shareholder value.
The Portland Cement Association or PCA forecasts a favorable supply demand imbalance in Texas over the next several years, with continuing growth on an annual basis through 2019. We believe this forecast supports continued resilient growth. In that regard, it's important to recognize and understand the diversity of the Texas economy. Today's Texas is not the Texas of the early 1980s. In the 1980s, the Texas construction sector was overbuilt. On average from 1982 to 1984, when there were nearly 11 million fewer people living in Texas, annual housing permits were approximately 75,000 higher than during 2012 to 2014. Importantly, too, over the last decade, Texas has led the United States in terms of job growth, creating 30% of new jobs across the country. This has led to near continuous positive net migration to the state, a trend that's expected to continue.
In addition to increased housing demands in the state, infrastructure spending, which represents our most aggregates intensive end-use, is also crucial to continued growth. The strong Texas Department of Transportation budget, coupled with the expected Proposition 7 annual contribution to stay transportation initiatives, should continue to provide a solid foundation for construction materials demand and extend the growth trajectory in Texas.
Moving back to our quarterly results. Consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A expenses, were 5.5% of net sales. The increase of 20 basis points compared with the prior-year quarter reflects the impact of higher pension expense. For the quarter, we incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate.
In connection with the California cement business divestiture, we recorded a loss on the sale of $25 million and also incurred nearly $4 million of related expenses. Excluding the nonrecurring loss and related charges, our adjusted earnings from operations for the quarter were $208 million, an improvement of 36% over the prior year quarter's adjusted earnings from operations of $153 million. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we generated $320 million of operating cash flow compared with $202 million in 2014. The 58% increase is due to higher earnings, partially offset by working capital needs in 2015. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project which we believe will be complete on time by year-end.
On a year-to-date basis, we've returned $339 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 1.6 million shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares in total. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015 was 2.2x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.
As we look ahead to completing a successful year, we expect consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, to range from $800 million to $820 million, exclusive of the onetime loss from the sale of the California cement business. The range also assumes we do not experience an early onset of winter weather in our key markets, thereby ending the construction season prematurely. This represents the most significant risk for our fourth quarter performance. As you're likely aware, recent weather events in South Carolina and Texas have affected activity. At this time, we do not expect a material impact on fourth quarter results. However, operational inefficiencies, if not offset by demand, could affect results.
We have also started to frame our preliminary end-use outlook for 2016. Based on our internal observations and external data published by Dodge Data and Analytics and the Portland Cement Association, we currently expect modest growth in the infrastructure and nonresidential markets and double-digit growth in the residential markets. ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be relatively flat. Cement demand in Texas is expected to increase 4% over 2015 levels. Our forecast does not reflect any major benefits that would come from the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill as there will be a long lag time or a lag time before bill provides meaningful impact to our business, thus the positive impact would occur beyond 2016.
To conclude, we continue to be excited about the future of Martin Marietta. We believe we are at the beginning stage of a construction-centric recovery in many of our key markets and we are extremely advantageously positioned to benefit from the expected upturn. Additionally, our third quarter results illustrate our growth trajectory when price, volume and costs are all favorable. We are focused on the execution of our strategic plan while remaining committed to our core foundational pillars, world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction. These pillars should lead to increased shareholder value.

Let's talk about it in 2 different ways. Let's talk about the outlook, and let's talk about margins going to look like because we're all talking about growth. We're just talking about how much growth it's going to be. Because as I'm sitting",514,"Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk about it in 2 different ways. Let's talk about the outlook, and let's talk about margins going to look like because we're all talking about growth. We're just talking about how much growth it's going to be. Because as I'm sitting here looking at what I think next year looks like, I think at some of the best outlook we've seen in years. We have broad-based state DOT initiatives that are in place. We have residential reacceleration under way. We see good private sector nonresidential work. There's some huge nonbuilding projects and what I think will be continued great pricing dynamics. But here's the way that I would encourage you to think about margin, Kathryn, here's a great way I want to think of it. If we look at the margins that we pick out on our business, incremental 77 across the business, you see what we did in the aggregate space all by itself. Here's the way to think of it. For the quarter, I'm looking at heritage tonnage right now. For the quarter, our heritage aggregates tonnage was 42.8 million. Last year, for the similar quarter, 40.6 million. So a couple of million tons. Let's look at it through 9 months. 106.5 million versus 104.3 million. Any way you look at it, it's about 2 million tons. Let's put that in context, and I think it helps with the margin. 2 million tons is about the size of what I would think is a really good quarry, one quarry. Here's the difference. The profit increase for the quarter from those 2 million tons for the quarter was $30 million. The profit increase through the 9 months for those 2 million tons was $85 million. Remember what my comments were at the end of the commentary when your volume, price and cost all working in the right direction, it's very powerful. Part of what we said on the incremental margins is when we get to the point that we've recovered half of the volume that we lost in the downturn, and remember that was 80 million tons, we thought we'd see on average 60% incrementals in the business. And clearly, what we're seeing right now on the role of that business is far better than that. If we're back to the notion of being at the beginning innings of a construction-centric recovery and you're seeing that type of profitability over that small amount of tonnage, and keep in mind what this means, Kathryn, this is not what our most profitable business well yet. This is what our most profitable business starting to get well in Georgia and Florida and North Carolina. So we see the type of acceleration in those markets that I hope we'll see, then the types of margins that you've seen in this quarter and otherwise, I believe, will continue to replicate themselves and we're more than comfortable with that 60% margin that we put out there. That's a long answer, but your question is a good one, I want to be thorough with the response."

Let me approach it this way. Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look",792,"Thank you, Kathryn. Let me approach it this way. Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look at Colorado as our front running state right now with a lot of room ahead of it. The employment picture in Colorado is very good. Denver is ranked 23rd nationally. There's a private sector that's really very strong. It's ranked 11th in housing starts. Their DOT program remains remarkably attractive. That's up 9% for the trailing 12 months. And again, what we're seeing there on downstream pricing continues to be very good. I think what our team in that marketplace has done with the ready-mix business is really impressive. If we come farther south and take a look at what's going on in Texas, remember, it's third in employment, it's up almost 900,000 jobs over the last 36 months. We've got I-35 in North Texas going DFW and Dallas/Fort Worth and obviously Grand Parkway in Houston. And then we've got what we believe is going to be the coming of the $2.5 billion really hitting in '17 coming from Proposition 7. Another state or 2 to think about as long as we're still west in Mississippi are both Iowa and Nebraska. And Iowa has been a remarkably consistent performer for us. But here's the pop we're going to see in Iowa. We're seeing higher gas taxes there. We're going to see DOT dollars up 30%. And we see a farm economy there this year that some portions of the farm economy in fairness are down, we are seeing tremendous yields in the farm economy. So when we come back and look at tremendous yields on what that could mean in Q4 or Q1, again weather dependent, very good circumstances. If we transition across the Mississippi River, let's talk about Florida for a second, very positive, all segments are up, number 2 in job growth, very strong DOT program, number 1 in residential and number 4 in nonres, which I know you asked me about, we'd hit more about that in just a second. The state of Georgia, I believe, finally, finally, is starting to hit its stride. It's lagged Florida just a bit, but right now, it's number 9 in job growth, it's number 3 in residential. We are seeing a double of the DOT in that state. And we're going to start to feel that impact really even more profoundly late in '16. And the teapots program in South Georgia puts some much needed volume in that part of the state. And then lastly, but certainly not least, is what we're seeing here in our home state of North Carolina. What I would tell you is that state's really up-and-coming right now, number 5 in employment, it's just past Georgia in fact. It's number 8 in single-family. And what we're looking at right now on a trailing 12 months at least through August is we're seeing DOT awards up almost 47%, and we're seeing good work come up on HOT lanes in Charlotte right now. So if we look at those 6 states that are disproportionately important to us right now, I think that gives you a pretty good sense of where it is. Now the other part of your question, Kathryn, that I want to try to answer is really what's going on with nonres. Because again, if we're going to sense that nonres is ill, that's not a sense that we're trying to give. Nonres particularly on the heavy side, I think that's where your question was, tend to be good long-term multiyear jobs. So think of it on these terms. If we're looking at nonres construction, again on a trailing 12 month basis, Florida is up 40%, North Carolina is up 18%, South Carolina is up 31% and Colorado, which began its recovery well ahead of others, is up 7%. At the same time, if we look at some of those states at the same percentage over a three-year period and again, I'd say that because they're multiyear, Florida up 54%, North Carolina up 11%, Georgia up 24% and Texas up 85%. So again, if we're looking at heavy construction with years of tail to it, I think it's got a pretty good story. And then obviously, the story of the quarter relative to the light side of it, that tends to follow housing, was really a very attractive quarter and again in the states that we believe are disproportionately important to us, we think will continue to be a good story. Did I hit what you needed on that?"

This is specifically with regard to nonres and on the fact that you've seen the latter nonres kind of follow through and certainly get performance in 3Q. But I mean that is where you trend the guidance for the year and the outlook, the preliminary outlook for next year has kind of a slower pace of growth implied than what you've seen this year in nonres going from sort of we were at high single digits, now we are a little mid single digit, I can't remember exactly. And then you're talking about sort of slight growth next year. So what's the disconnect? I mean, why are we seeing a deceleration there?"

If you're looking at what's there and the volumes that we're likely to see on existing projects, again, that are multiyear, Todd, I think you can see a host of very strong multiyear projects that are already on the books. So really what I would tell you is this, are we seeing a bit of a slowing in the trajectory of some of the growth in Texas? I think the answer is yes. But if you're looking at the numbers and the way growth has been in that state over the last several years, it's been so heady that it almost has been naturally pulled back while it's still growing. Now here's what I think the wildcard is. If you want to tell me or others want to say, I think it's getting better in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida and South Carolina more quickly than you're saying, and I'll take that because I think there's going to be nice growth in those states as well. But again, if you start seeing a higher rate of growth in heavy nonres in the Eastern United States, that's really going to be the swing factor in some of this because I think when we go to Texas and simply look at what's going on there, or Colorado or Iowa or others, it's going to continue to be very healthy. We're simply talking about rates of growth and we are already seeing volumes in some of those states that are at very, very good levels. So if you're doing a compare across our geography and try to sort out where is there continued room for growth? It's in the east much more so than it is in the West. And the East has been a slower, steady growth pattern really for the last 2 years and you can see what the result is on the bottom line this year."

And that is in a circumstance where you believe you have more muted growth than others, meaning really sub 5%, then pricing as a percent and volume as a percent end up being relatively tied to each other, particularly as you go up the ladder right now. So what I would say is, if I'm looking at pricing across our group right now, you saw the up 5%. At the same time if I'm looking at it on a group by group basis, not surprisingly, we're seeing bigger price increases on a percentage basis in the Western United States in large part because there's room for that in the West because it's been lower. But what I would suggest, is the view that we've shared really for the last couple of years on pricing has not materially changed."

First of all, let's talk about some of the dynamic that simply occurs because we're not going to be in cement in California anymore. So let's start with that and talk about the picture that you saw from the quarter because I think that's important to really understand and have context around. So 70% of the volume decline for the quarter was attributable to Riverside in California. So what you had immediately is when the deal is announced, you had certain customers who were seeing a change in that marketplace, who were seeing a nonvertically integrated player, ourselves, going away, and the downstream customers realigning themselves. So that was what we really saw in the quarter. We back away from that, and really you're looking at cement volumes down 4%. Our quick snapshot is of the 4%, about 2% of that is cement that's no longer finding its way to oil or the oil patch or others trying to find a home for some of that. And the other I think is directly to your point, Garik, and that is you do have a new importer right now in South Texas and there has been some share that's gone there. What I think we are focused on is value right now. To your point, we're looking at a $12 a ton price increase in April. We are the market leader in Texas, and we have a lot of conviction around that. As I look at what Texas capacity is and look at what Texas demand is, both in 2016 and 2017, I'm seeing something in '16 that's going to be close to 2.8 million tons of deficit. I'm seeing what people are projecting to be about a 3.2 million ton deficit as we go into '17. So as we are sitting here with what I feel like a very attractive and efficient plants, both in North Texas and Central Texas, I mean, here's what I'll tell you. What we have done relative to the efficiencies at Midlothian and Hunter during the time that we've been there, I think, is impressive. We can run plants in Texas as efficiently as anybody. If we want to go and get share, we can go and get share. That's not how I think we're going to put value for our shareholders today. And we're resilient on making sure that we're getting the price in that marketplace. I'm confident that we can. And the fact is, at certain levels, and I think this is where we are, price is more valuable than volume. So if you come back and take a look at what our performance was in the quarter, remember what I said in my comments, our cement results were impressive. And we believe that. And I believe we got a very good team. I think we've got superb locations. I think we've got great operations. And I think, given the dynamics in that marketplace, I feel pretty good about it, if you can't tell."

I mean, we're just looking -- we're talking about the West Group for a second because what we're really seeing if we look at the West Group is we saw tonnage 15 million tons versus 14 million in the prior year. And one thing to remember is North Troy tonnage is in there for last year. So that's going to throw that offer pretty markedly. Frankly, if we look at what we see in Texas for next year, I think that's probably what you're pretty interested in, too, I'm going to say I'm feeling pretty good about it. I mean if we break it down and look at it this way, Keith, in North Texas, I think, the market there next year is better than it is this year in large part driven by very large projects. The horseshoe project in downtown Dallas as well as I-35 E and W are both going to be underway in North Texas in the Metroplex. State Highway 183 is very much underway. Even when we move farther south to Houston, part of what I look at, is not just what we have awarded. And by the way, that's I-69 and market roads 1488 and 1774. And some of the work that we have with Freeport LNG but really what's coming and. I'm seeing good work relative to the Harris County tollway authority. Good text ductwork. Good work also at Bush airport. And then when we come down to South Texas and when looking at the large energy and infrastructure projects that really in my view support a good business in 2016 and beyond at, at the pipe plants, harbor bridge and otherwise, and the volume that I think we're going to see in Texas on this long list of projects is really attractive. The other thing that I'm moved by in Texas right now is TxDOT already has a big budget. But if you spoke to the people at TxDOT, what they would tell you is it looks good, backlogs are good, going forward with work it looks attractive and, by the way, when we start putting this Prop 7 money to it, it's going to feel like it's on some degree of steroids. So again, you're talking big numbers in a state that already has big numbers. But what gives me a sense of, Keith, is it's likely to be healthy there for a good going forward. If you need more, I'm happy to talk about more Texas, I want to make sure."

Because I think the guidance was $6 million in 3Q, $14 million in 4Q and I think you did just under that and expect that to double so maybe it's a few million less in the 4Q than you originally expected. Is that accurate?"

Again, I think pricing next year is going to be a very good story. And if we can run effectively through Thanksgiving, you can have a Q4 that could make up some of that volume.

I mean, one of the river came out of its banks and filtered up. And we'll pump it out, and we'll put it right back into the broad River. The quarry happens to be a rail connected quarry and it's as you recall call, Craig, we've got the largest rail connected quarry system in the United States in the aggregates business. So we can go into the marketplaces that can now not be served by North Columbia by rail from other quarries and we can equally come into markets by boat. So from a market service perspective, I don't think we're going to be that affected by it. From an efficiency perspective, can we be affected by it? Yes. And I guess the other thing that I would say is insurance and circumstances like that is pretty difficult to have. So, in large part, tend to be relatively self-insured. And so what I would tell you there's going to be some capital that is going to be utilized in that as we go forward. And the other thing just in fairness, we did experience over the weekend pretty considerable rain events in Central and South Texas as well. And in our facility on south of Austin, we got a lot more water there than we typically would. And at Garwood sanding level, which is typically a wet operation, we've got more water there than usual.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
By any measure, this was an outstanding quarter for us. We recorded record net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Our performance in the third quarter reflects some basic realities about today's Martin Marietta, namely, the growing demand for construction materials, coupled with our operational excellence and synergy realization, has enabled us to generate net sales that exceeded $1 billion, a milestone for us as well as achieve our stated incremental margin objective by delivering $0.77 of gross profit on each incremental dollar of net sales over the prior year quarter.
Further to that point, we believe that we're in the beginning stages of a construction-centric recovery that's taking place in our country and most importantly for us, in those markets we serve. As a result, we see further opportunities to increase our sales, profits and cash flow in the coming months and even years.
The past quarter also saw us complete the sale of our California cement operations in a cash transaction of $420 million. In anticipation of the proceeds from the sale, we repurchased $158 million of our common stock during the third quarter, giving us the opportunity to further enhance shareholder value. We anticipate returning the remaining net proceeds to shareholders with additional stock repurchases throughout the remainder of the year.
Before we discuss third quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe this provides meaningful data to better analyze our third quarter performance. Let me briefly summarize the supplemental information. 
Slide 2 provides comparative net sales and gross profit, which helps illustrate our profit trajectory. Slides 3 and 4 provide product line volume and pricing metrics. We're pleased to report solid growth in each product line. Finally, Slide 5, provides a roll forward of our earnings from operations.
Now let's delve into some of the underlying details that support these metrics. Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market account for approximately 43% of total volumes and increased more than 5% compared with the prior year quarter. We're encouraged to see states take increased responsibility for funding infrastructure investment. In fact, highway awards for the trailing 12 months through July were their highest levels since 2000, with major project activity continuing to accelerate in the Southeastern United States and Texas.
Additionally, today, voters in Texas are expected to pass Proposition 7, a valid initiative that would dedicate an additional $2.5 billion annually for nontoll road projects beginning in 2017.
Last week, federal highway funding was extended to November 20 with the passage of the 35th short-term patch since 2008. The roughly 3-week duration of this continuing resolution increases our optimism regarding the passage of a multi-year federal highway bill this year, a move that has bipartisan support in Congress, in which the President has indicated his willingness to sign. To that effect, on October 18, Congressman Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, introduced the $325 billion surface transportation reauthorization and reformat. This means that together with the Senate's previously announced Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy Act, or DRIVE, for the first time in over a decade, both chambers of Congress are readying to advance multi-year federal highway bills. Should a federal highway bill be passed before the end of the year, any meaningful impact on our business would not be expected prior to the second half of 2016. But clearly, its positive impact will be felt for several years thereafter.
The nonresidential end-use market is comprised of 2 components, light construction and heavy construction. The light nonresidential construction component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with these drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volume increased 29%. Importantly, each reportable group achieved double-digit growth in this component of construction, with the largest percentage increase being reported in the Southeast division. Light nonresidential shipments are benefiting from low energy prices and years of steady employment growth. In fact, nonfarm employment in the United States is currently about 4 million jobs above the prerecession peak.
The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 21% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and declined 9% compared with the third quarter of 2014. As expected, shale energy-related volumes were down versus the prior year quarter. However, we expect large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects during the remainder of the year and early 2016 to offset the decline in direct shale exploration activity.
Despite the reduction in shale-related shipments, domestic crude oil production is projected to reach 9.25 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of more than 500,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels, all evidence of continuing energy sector transformation in the United States.
Nonresidential construction activity continues to vary by location. Texas again led the nation with more than $24 billion of starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015. Significant job growth -- significant growth is also being experienced in key Southeastern states, including Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Our leading positions in these markets should allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.
The residential end-use market represented 18% of aggregates shipments and increased 15% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be in line with the trend in housing starts. Texas leads the nation in single-family unit starts while Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina each rank in the top 10 in growth for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets for the third quarter, the ChemRock/Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our third quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were up 7%, attributable to increased railroad ballast shipment, which in part are driven by deferred maintenance from prior years when rail congestion and weather hindered such activity.
Aggregates product line pricing increased in all reportable groups led by the West Group, consistent with our stated expectations. Overall, we achieved a 5% increase.
Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped was down slightly, with lower energy prices benefiting the cost structure. On average, we paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.09 in the prior year quarter, contributing to an $11 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the entire company. During the first 9 months of the year, we've recognized a total of $16 million in diesel fuel savings despite a 22% increase in consumption driven by economic growth and in the TXI acquisition.
The aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by almost $13 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mixed concrete product line reported a 19% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average selling price.
Gross profit for the Aggregates business increased $60 million and resulted in a gross margin increase of 500 basis points over the prior year quarter to 25.3% of net sales. In fact, we are very pleased to note that all of our reportable business segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by a 780 basis point increase in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. We expect further recovery to provide opportunities to expand profitability towards historical levels for the Southeast Group.
Overall, our Aggregates business exceeded our publicly stated target and generated an incremental gross margin of 68%.
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $57 million and a gross margin of 34%. For the quarter, the business's earnings from operations were $17 million, a slight decline compared with the prior year. Net sales and earnings were negatively impacted by decline in domestic steel production.
Our third quarter Cement business results are impressive. Gross profit increased $14 million as the 16% increase in average selling price to nearly $100 per ton and synergy realization more than offset volume declines. Gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points to 34.5%. For the quarter, the business incurred almost $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs, which, as expected, will likely double in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the Cement business shipped 1.1 million tons to external customers. Over 70% or 138,000 tons of the decline in cement shipments during the quarter resulted from the sale of the California cement business. Upon announcement of the sale of that business, as expected, certain customers realigned their volumes to other suppliers. Excluding the California sale impact, cement shipments declined 4%, with half resulting from a loss of direct shipments to the energy sector and the other half from the well-publicized introduction of new cement capacity in Texas. We remain diligent in achieving margin growth through a disciplined price structure. The aim is, as ever, to increase profitability and shareholder value.
The Portland Cement Association or PCA forecasts a favorable supply/demand imbalance in Texas over the next several years, with continuing growth on an annual basis through 2019. We believe this forecast supports continued resilient growth. In that regard, it's important to recognize and understand the diversity of the Texas economy. Today's Texas is not the Texas of the early 1980s. In the 1980s, the Texas construction sector was overbuilt. On average from 1982 to 1984, when there were nearly 11 million fewer people living in Texas, annual housing permits were approximately 75,000 higher than during 2012 to 2014. Importantly, too, over the last decade, Texas has led the United States in terms of job growth, creating 30% of new jobs across the country. This has led to near continuous positive net migration to the state, a trend that's expected to continue.
In addition to increased housing demands in the state, infrastructure spending, which represents our most aggregates intensive end-use, is also crucial to continued growth. The strong Texas Department of Transportation budget, coupled with the expected Proposition 7 annual contribution to state transportation initiatives, should continue to provide a solid foundation for construction materials demand and extend the growth trajectory in Texas.
Moving back to our quarterly results. Consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A expenses, were 5.5% of net sales. The increase of 20 basis points compared with the prior year quarter reflects the impact of higher pension expense. For the quarter, we incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate.
In connection with the California cement business divestiture, we recorded a loss on the sale of $25 million and also incurred nearly $4 million of related expenses. Excluding the nonrecurring loss and related charges, our adjusted earnings from operations for the quarter were $208 million, an improvement of 36% over the prior year quarter's adjusted earnings from operations of $153 million. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we generated $320 million of operating cash flow compared with $202 million in 2014. The 58% increase is due to higher earnings, partially offset by working capital needs in 2015. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project which we believe will be complete on time by yearend.
On a year-to-date basis, we've returned $339 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 1.6 million shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares in total. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015 was 2.2x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.
As we look ahead to completing a successful year, we expect consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, to range from $800 million to $820 million, exclusive of the onetime loss from the sale of the California cement business. The range also assumes we do not experience an early onset of winter weather in our key markets, thereby ending the construction season prematurely. This represents the most significant risk for our fourth quarter performance. As you're likely aware, recent weather events in South Carolina and Texas have affected activity. At this time, we do not expect a material impact on fourth quarter results. However, operational inefficiencies, if not offset by demand, could affect results.
We have also started to frame our preliminary end-use outlook for 2016. Based on our internal observations and external data published by Dodge Data & Analytics and the Portland Cement Association, we currently expect modest growth in the infrastructure and nonresidential markets and double-digit growth in the residential market. ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be relatively flat. Cement demand in Texas is expected to increase 4% over 2015 levels. Our forecast does not reflect any major benefit that would come from the passage of a multi-year federal highway bill as there will be a long lag time or a lag time before a bill provides meaningful impact to our business, thus the positive impact would occur beyond 2016.
To conclude, we continue to be excited about the future of Martin Marietta. We believe we're at the beginning stage of the construction-centric recovery in many of our key markets, and we're extremely advantageously positioned to benefit from the expected upturn. Additionally, our third quarter results illustrate our growth trajectory when price, volume and costs are all favorable. We're focused on the execution of our strategic plan while remaining committed to our core foundational pillars, world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction. These pillars should lead to increased shareholder value.

We're just talking about how much growth this is going to be. Becaus",514,"Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk about it in 2 different ways. Let's talk about the outlook, and let's talk about really what margin's going to look like because we're all talking about growth. We're just talking about how much growth this is going to be. Because as I'm sitting here looking at what I think next year looks like, I think it's some of the best outlook we've seen in years. We have broad-based state DOT initiatives that are in place. We have residential reacceleration underway. We see good private sector nonresidential work. There's some huge nonbuilding projects and what I think will be continued great pricing dynamics. But here's the way that I would encourage you to think about margin, Kathryn. Here's a great way, I think, to think of it. If we look at the margins that we pick out on our business, incremental 77 across the business, you see what we did in the aggregates space all by itself. Here's the way to think of it. For the quarter -- I'm looking at heritage tonnage right now. For the quarter, our heritage aggregates tonnage was 42.8 million. Last year, for the similar quarter, 40.6 million. So a couple of million tons. Let's look at it through 9 months. 106.5 million versus 104.3 million. Any way you look at it, it's about 2 million tons. Let's put that in context, and I think it helps with the margin. 2 million tons is about the size of what I would think is a really good quarry, one quarry. Here's the difference. The profit increase for the quarter from those 2 million tons for the quarter was $30 million. The profit increase through the 9 months for those 2 million tons was $85 million. Remember what my comments were at the end of the commentary when volume, price and cost all working in the right direction, it's very powerful. Part of what we said on the incremental margins is when we get to the point that we've recovered half of the volume that we lost in the downturn, and remember that was 80 million tons, we thought we'd see on average 60% incrementals in the business. And clearly, what we're seeing right now on the rolled-up business is far better than that. If we're back to the notion of being at the beginning innings of a construction-centric recovery, and you're seeing that type of profitability over that small amount of tonnage and keep in mind what this means, Kathryn, this is not what our most profitable business well yet. This is what our most profitable business starting to get well in Georgia and Florida and North Carolina. So we see the type of acceleration in those markets that I hope we'll see, then the types of margins that you've seen in this quarter and otherwise, I believe, will continue to replicate themselves, and we're more than comfortable with that 60% margin that we put out there. That's a long answer, but your question is a good one, I want to be thorough with the response."

Let me approach it this way. Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look",793,"Thank you, Kathryn. Let me approach it this way. Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look at Colorado as our front-running state right now with a lot of room ahead of it. The employment picture in Colorado is very good. Denver is ranked 23rd nationally. There's a private sector that's really very strong. It's ranked 11th in housing starts. Their DOT program remains remarkably attractive. That's up 9% for the trailing 12 months. And again, what we're seeing there on downstream pricing continues to be very good. I think what our team in that marketplace has done with the ready mixed business is really impressive. If we come farther south and take a look at what's going on in Texas, remember, it's third in employment, it's up almost 900,000 jobs over the last 36 months. We've got I-35 in North Texas -- I'm going DFW and Dallas and Fort Worth and obviously the Grand Parkway in Houston. And then we've got what we believe is going to be the coming of the $2.5 billion really hitting in '17 coming from Proposition 7. Another state or 2 to think about as long as we're still west in Mississippi are both Iowa and Nebraska. And Iowa has been a remarkably consistent performer for us. But here's the pop we're going to see in Iowa. We're seeing higher gas taxes there. We're going to see DOT dollars up 30%. And we see a farm economy there this year that on some portions of the farm economy in fairness are down, we are seeing tremendous yields in the farm economy. So when we come back and look at tremendous yields on what that could mean into Q4 or Q1, again weather-dependent, very good [indiscernible] circumstances. If we transition across the Mississippi River, let's talk about Florida for a second, very positive, all segments are up, #2 in job growth, very strong DOT program, #1 in residential and #4 in nonres, which I know you asked me about, we'll hit more about that in just a second. The state of Georgia, I believe, finally, finally, is starting to hit its stride. It's lagged Florida just a bit, but right now, it's #9 in job growth, it's #3 in residential. We're seeing a double of the DOT in that state. And we're going to start to feel that impact really even more profoundly late in '16. And the T-SPLOST program in South Georgia puts some much needed volume in that part of the state. And then lastly, but certainly not least, is what we're seeing here in our home state of North Carolina. What I would tell you is that state is really up and coming right now, #5 in employment. It's just past Georgia, in fact. It's #8 in single-family. And what we're looking at right now on a trailing 12 months, at least through August, is we're seeing DOT awards up almost 47%, and we're seeing good work come up on HOT lanes in Charlotte right now. So if we look at those 6 states that are disproportionately important to us right now, I think that gives you a pretty good sense of where it is. Now the other part of your question, Kathryn, that I want to try to answer is really what's going on with nonres. Because again, if we're going to sense that nonres is ill, that's not a sense that we're trying to give. Nonres, particularly, on the heavy side, and I think that's where your question was, tend to be good, long-term multi-year jobs. So think of it on these terms. If we're looking at nonres construction, again, on a trailing 12-month basis, Florida is up 40%; North Carolina is up 18%; South Carolina is up 31%; and Colorado, which began its recovery well ahead of others, is up 7%. At the same time, if we look at some of those states and the same percentage over a 3-year period and again, I'd say that because they're multi-year, Florida up 54%, North Carolina up 11%, Georgia up 24%, and Texas up 85%. So again, if we're looking at heavy construction with years of tail to it, I think it's got a pretty good story. And then obviously, the story in the quarter relative to the light side of it, that tends to follow housing, was really a very attractive quarter and again in the states that we believe are disproportionately important to us, we think will continue to be a good story. Did I hit what you needed on that?"

This is specifically with regard to nonres and on the fact that you've seen the latter nonres kind of follow through and certainly get performance in 3Q. But I mean that is where you trend the guidance for the year and the outlook, the preliminary outlook for next year has kind of a slower pace of growth implied than what you've seen this year in nonres going from sort of we were at high single digits, now we're low to mid-single digit, I can't remember exactly. And then you're talking about sort of slight growth next year. So what's the disconnect? I mean, why are we seeing a deceleration there?"

If you're looking at what's there and the volumes that we're likely to see on existing projects, again, that are multi-year, Todd, I think you can see a host of very strong multi-year projects that are already on the books. So really what I would tell you is this. Are we seeing a bit of a slowing in the trajectory of some of the growth in Texas? I think the answer is yes. But if you're looking at the numbers and the way growth has been in that state over the last several years, it's been so heady that it almost has been naturally pulled back while it's still growing. Now here's what I think the wildcard is. If you want to tell me or others want to say but what I think it's getting better in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida and South Carolina more quickly than you're saying, I'll take that because I think there's going to be nice growth in those states as well. But again, if you start seeing a higher rate of growth in heavy nonres in the Eastern United States, that's really going to be the swing factor in some of this because I think when we go to Texas and simply look at what's going on there, or Colorado or Iowa or others, it's going to continue to be very healthy. We're simply talking about rates of growth, and we're already seeing volumes in some of those states that are at very, very good levels. So if you're doing a compare across our geography and try to sort out where is there candidly continued room for growth? It's in the east much more so than it is in the West. And the East has been a slower, steady growth pattern really for the last 2 years, and you can see what the result is on the bottom line this year."

At the same time if I'm looking at it on a group-by-group basis, not surprisingly, we're seeing bigger price increases on a percentage basis in the Western United States in large part because there's room for that in the West because it's been lower.

First of all, let's talk about some of the dynamic that simply occurs because we're not going to be in cement in California anymore. So let's start with that and talk about the picture that you saw from the quarter because I think that's important to really understand and have context around. So 70% of the volume decline for the quarter was attributable to Riverside in California. So what you had immediately is when the deal is announced, you had certain customers who were seeing a change in that marketplace, who were seeing a nonvertically integrated player, ourselves, going away, and the downstream customers realigning themselves. So that was what we really saw in the quarter. We back away from that, and really you're looking at cement volumes down 4%. Our quick snapshot is of the 4%, about 2% of that is cement that's no longer finding its weight of oil or the oil patch or others trying to find a home for some of that. And the other I think is directly to your point, Garik, and that is you do have a new importer right now in South Texas, and there has been some share that's gone there. What I think we're focused on is value right now. To your point, we're looking at a $12 a ton price increase in April. We are the market leader in Texas, and we have a lot of conviction around that. As I look at what Texas capacity is and look at what Texas demand is, both in 2016 and 2017, I'm seeing something in '16 that's going to be close to 2.8 million tons of deficit. I'm seeing what people are projecting to be about a 3.2 million ton deficit as we go into '17. So as we're sitting here with what I feel like are very attractive and efficient plants, both in North Texas and Central Texas, I mean, here's what I would tell you. What we have done relative to the efficiencies at Midlothian and Hunter during the time that we've been there, I think, is impressive. We can run plants in Texas as efficiently as anybody. If we want to go and get share, we can go and get share. That's not how I think we're going to put value for our shareholders today. And we're resilient on making sure that we're getting the price in that marketplace. I'm confident that we can. And the fact is, at certain levels, and I think this is where we are, price is more valuable than volume. So if you come back and take a look at what our performance was in the quarter, remember what I said in my comments, our cement results were impressive. And we believe that. And I believe we've got a very good team. I think we've got superb locations. I think we've got great operations. And I think, given the dynamics in that marketplace, I feel pretty good about it, if you can't tell."

I mean, we're just looking at -- we'll talk about the West Group for a second because what we're really seeing if we look at the West Group is we saw tonnage 15 million tons versus 14 million in the prior year. One thing to remember is North Troy tonnage is in there for last year. So that's going to throw that off pretty markedly. Frankly, if we look at what we see in Texas for next year, I think that's probably what you're pretty interested in, too. I got to say I feel pretty good about it. I mean, if we break it down and look at it this way, Keith, I mean, North Texas, I think, the market there next year is better than it is this year in large part driven by very large projects. The horseshoe project in downtown Dallas as well as I-35 E and W are both going to be underway in North Texas in the Metroplex. State Highway 183 is very much underway. Even when we move farther south to Houston, part of what I look at, is not just what we have awarded. And by the way, that's I-69 and Farm to Market Roads 1488 and 1774. And some of the work that we've had in Freeport LNG but really what's coming. And I'm seeing good work relative to the Harris County Tollway Authority. Good TxDOT work. Good work also at Bush airport. And then when we come down to South Texas and when looking at the large energy and infrastructure projects that really, in my view, support a good business in 2016 and beyond at Cheniere, at the pipe plants, harbor bridge and otherwise. And the volume that I think we're going to see in Texas on this long-lived projects is really attractive. The other thing that I'm moved by in Texas right now is TxDOT already has a big budget. But if you spoke to the people at TxDOT, what they would tell you is it looks good, backlogs are good, going forward with work, it looks attractive and by the way, when we start putting this Prop 7 money to it, it's going to feel like it's on some degree of steroids. So again, you're talking big numbers in a state that already has big numbers. But what it gives me a sense of, Keith, is it's likely to be healthy there for a good volumes going forward.

I mean, the -- one of the Broad River came out of its banks and filtered up. And we'll pump it out, and we'll put it right back into the broad river. The quarry happens to be a rail connected quarry, and it as you recall call, Craig, we've got the largest rail connected quarry system in the United States in the Aggregates business. So we can go into the marketplaces that can now not be served by North Columbia by rail from other quarries, and we can equally come into markets by boat. So from a market service perspective, I don't think we're going to be that affected by it. From an efficiency perspective, can we be affected by it? Yes. And I guess the other thing that I would say is insurance and circumstances like that is pretty difficult to have. So in large part, tend to be relatively self-insured. And so what I would tell you is there's going to be some capital that's going to be utilized in that as we go forward. And the other thing just in fairness, we did experience over the weekend pretty considerable rain events in Central and South Texas as well. And in our Webberville facility outside of Austin, we got a lot more water there than we typically would. And at Garwood sanding level, which is typically a wet operation, we got more water there than usual. Again, do I view these as material? No, I don't. Are they issues that can affect pure efficiencies in some markets? Sure. But as we said in the commentary, relative to Q4, weather is the single most important variable on the way that quarter is going to play out."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
By any measure, this was an outstanding quarter for us. We recorded record net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Our performance in the third quarter reflects some basic realities about today's Martin Marietta, namely, the growing demand for construction materials, coupled with our operational excellence and synergy realization, has enabled us to generate net sales that exceeded $1 billion, a milestone for us, as well as achieve our stated incremental margin objective by delivering $0.77 of gross profit on each incremental dollar of net sales over the prior year quarter.
Further to that point, we believe that we're in the beginning stages of a construction-centric recovery that's taking place in our country and, most importantly for us, in those markets we serve. As a result, we see further opportunities to increase our sales, profits and cash flow in the coming months and even years.
The past quarter also saw us complete the sale of our California cement operations in a cash transaction of $420 million. In anticipation of the proceeds from the sale, we repurchased $158 million of our common stock during the third quarter, giving us the opportunity to further enhance shareholder value. We anticipate returning the remaining net proceeds to shareholders with additional stock repurchases throughout the remainder of the year.
Before we discuss third quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.
In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe this provides meaningful data to better analyze our third quarter performance. Let me briefly summarize the supplemental information. 
Slide 2 provides comparative net sales and gross profit, which helps illustrate our profit trajectory. Slides 3 and 4 provide product line volume and pricing metrics. We're pleased to report solid growth in each product line. Finally, Slide 5 provides a roll forward of our earnings from operations.
Now let's delve into some of the underlying details that support these metrics. Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market account for approximately 43% of total volumes and increased more than 5% compared with the prior year quarter. We're encouraged to see states take increased responsibility for funding infrastructure investment. In fact, highway awards for the trailing 12 months through July were at their highest levels since 2000 with major project activity continuing to accelerate in the Southeastern United States and Texas.
Additionally, today, voters in Texas are expected to pass Proposition 7, a ballot initiative that would dedicate an additional $2.5 billion annually for nontoll-road projects beginning in 2017.
Last week, federal highway funding was extended to November 20 with the passage of the 35th short-term patch since 2008. The roughly 3-week duration of this continuing resolution increases our optimism regarding the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill this year, a move that has bipartisan support in Congress and which the President has indicated his willingness to sign. To that effect, on October 18, Congressman Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, introduced the $325 billion Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act. This means that together with the Senate's previously announced Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy Act, or DRIVE, for the first time in over a decade, both chambers of Congress are readying to advance multiyear federal highway bills. Should a federal highway bill be passed before the end of the year, any meaningful impact on our business would not be expected prior to the second half of 2016. But clearly, its positive impact will be felt for several years thereafter.
The nonresidential end-use market is comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction. The light nonresidential construction component is primarily office and retail with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with these drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volume increased 29%. Importantly, each reportable group achieved double-digit growth in this component of construction with the largest percentage increase being reported in the Southeast division. Light nonresidential shipments are benefiting from low energy prices and years of steady employment growth. In fact, nonfarm employment in the United States is currently about 4 million jobs above the prerecession peak.
The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 21% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and declined 9% compared with the third quarter of 2014. As expected, shale energy-related volumes were down versus the prior year quarter. However, we expect large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects during the remainder of the year and early 2016 to offset the decline in direct shale exploration activity.
Despite the reduction in shale-related shipments, domestic crude oil production is projected to reach 9.25 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of more than 500,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels, all evidence of continuing energy sector transformation in the United States.
Nonresidential construction activity continues to vary by location. Texas again led the nation with more than $24 billion of starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015. Significant job growth -- significant growth is also being experienced in key Southeastern states, including Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Our leading positions in these markets should allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.
The residential end-use market represented 18% of aggregates shipments and increased 15% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be in line with the trend in housing starts. Texas leads the nation in single-family unit starts, while Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina each rank in the top 10 in growth for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015.
Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets for the third quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our third quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were up 7%, attributable to increased railroad ballast shipments, which in part are driven by deferred maintenance from prior years when rail congestion and weather hindered such activity.
Aggregates product line pricing increased in all reportable groups led by the West Group, consistent with our stated expectations. Overall, we achieved a 5% increase.
Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped was down slightly with lower energy prices benefiting the cost structure. On average, we paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.09 in the prior year quarter, contributing to an $11 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the entire company. During the first 9 months of the year, we've recognized a total of $16 million in diesel fuel savings despite a 22% increase in consumption driven by economic growth and in the TXI acquisition.
The aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by almost $13 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mix concrete product line reported a 19% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average selling price.
Gross profit for the Aggregates business increased $60 million and resulted in a gross margin increase of 500 basis points over the prior year quarter to 25.3% of net sales. In fact, we're very pleased to note that all of our reportable business segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by a 780 basis point increase in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. We expect further recovery to provide opportunities to expand profitability towards historical levels for the Southeast Group.
Overall, our Aggregates business exceeded our publicly stated target and generated an incremental gross margin of 68%.
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $57 million and a gross margin of 34%. For the quarter, the business's earnings from operations were $17 million, a slight decline compared with the prior year. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by decline in domestic steel production.
Our third quarter Cement business results are impressive. Gross profit increased $14 million as the 16% increase in average selling price to nearly $100 per ton and synergy realization more than offset volume declines. Gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points to 34.5%. For the quarter, the business incurred almost $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs, which as expected, will likely double in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the Cement business shipped 1.1 million tons to external customers. Over 70% or 138,000 tons of the decline in cement shipments during the quarter resulted from the sale of the California cement business. Upon announcement of the sale of that business, as expected, certain customers realigned their volumes to other suppliers. Excluding the California sale impact, cement shipments declined 4% with half resulting from a loss of direct shipments to the energy sector and the other half from the well-publicized introduction of new cement capacity in Texas. We remain diligent in achieving margin growth through a disciplined price structure. The aim is, as ever, to increase profitability and shareholder value.
The Portland Cement Association or PCA forecasts a favorable supply/demand imbalance in Texas over the next several years with continuing growth on an annual basis through 2019. We believe this forecast supports continued resilient growth. In that regard, it's important to recognize and understand the diversity of the Texas economy. Today's Texas is not the Texas of the early 1980s. In the 1980s, the Texas construction sector was overbuilt. On average from 1982 to 1984, when there were nearly 11 million fewer people living in Texas, annual housing permits were approximately 75,000 higher than during 2012 to 2014. Importantly, too, over the last decade, Texas has led the United States in terms of job growth, creating 30% of new jobs across the country. This has led to near continuous positive net migration to the state, a trend that's expected to continue.
In addition to increased housing demands in the state, infrastructure spending, which represents our most aggregates intensive end-use, is also crucial to continued growth. The strong Texas Department of Transportation budget coupled with the expected Proposition 7 annual contribution to state transportation initiatives should continue to provide a solid foundation for construction materials demand and extend the growth trajectory in Texas.
Moving back to our quarterly results. Consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were 5.5% of net sales. The increase of 20 basis points compared with the prior year quarter reflects the impact of higher pension expense. For the quarter, we incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate.
In connection with the California cement business divestiture, we recorded a loss on the sale of $25 million and also incurred nearly $4 million of related expenses. Excluding the nonrecurring loss and related charges, our adjusted earnings from operations for the quarter were $208 million, an improvement of 36% over the prior year quarter's adjusted earnings from operations of $153 million. 
For the first 9 months of the year, we generated $320 million of operating cash flow compared with $202 million in 2014. The 58% increase is due to higher earnings, partially offset by working capital needs in 2015. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project which we believe will be complete on time by year-end.
On a year-to-date basis, we've returned $339 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 1.6 million shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares in total. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015 was 2.2x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.
As we look ahead to completing a successful year, we expect consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA to range from $800 million to $820 million, exclusive of the onetime loss from the sale of the California cement business. The range also assumes we do not experience an early onset of winter weather in our key markets thereby ending the construction season prematurely. This represents the most significant risk for our fourth quarter performance. As you're likely aware, recent weather events in South Carolina and Texas have affected activity. At this time, we do not expect a material impact on fourth quarter results. However, operational inefficiencies, if not offset by demand, could affect results.
We have also started to frame our preliminary end-use outlook for 2016. Based on our internal observations and external data published by Dodge Data & Analytics and the Portland Cement Association, we currently expect modest growth in the infrastructure and nonresidential markets and double-digit growth in the residential market. ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be relatively flat. Cement demand in Texas is expected to increase 4% over 2015 levels. Our forecast does not reflect any major benefit that would come from the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill as there will be a long lag time or a lag time before a bill provides meaningful impact to our business, thus the positive impact would occur beyond 2016.
To conclude, we continue to be excited about the future of Martin Marietta. We believe we're at the beginning stage of the construction-centric recovery in many of our key markets, and we're extremely advantageously positioned to benefit from the expected upturn. Additionally, our third quarter results illustrate our growth trajectory when price, volume and costs are all favorable. We're focused on the execution of our strategic plan while remaining committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction. These pillars should lead to increased shareholder value.

Let's talk about the outlook, then let's talk about really what margin's going to look like because we're all talking about growth. We're just talking about how much growth there's going to be. Because as I'm sitting here looking at what I think next year looks like, I think it's some of the best outlook we've seen in years. We have broad-based state DOT initiatives that are in place. We have residential reacceleration underway. We see good private sector nonresidential work. There's some huge nonbuilding projects and what I think will be continued great pricing dynamics. But here's the way that I would encourage you to think about margin, Kathryn. Here's a great way, I think, to think of it. If we look at the margins that we kicked out on our business, incremental 77 across the business, you see what we did in the aggregates space all by itself. Here's the way to think of it. For the quarter -- I'm looking at heritage tonnage right now. For the quarter, our heritage aggregates tonnage was 42.8 million. Last year, for the similar quarter, 40.6 million. So a couple million tons. Let's look at it through 9 months. 106.5 million versus 104.3 million. Any way you look at it, it's about 2 million tons. Let's put that in context, and I think it helps with the margin. 2 million tons is about the size of what I would think is a really good quarry, one quarry. Here's the difference. The profit increase for the quarter from those 2 million tons for the quarter was $30 million. The profit increase through the 9 months for those 2 million tons was $85 million. Remember what my comments were at the end of the commentary when you have volume, price and cost all working in the right direction, it's very powerful. Part of what we said on the incremental margins is when we get to the point that we've recovered half of the volume that we lost in the downturn, and remember that was 80 million tons. We thought we'd see on average 60% incrementals in the business. And clearly, what we're seeing right now on the rolled-up business is far better than that. If we're back to the notion of being at the beginning innings of a construction-centric recovery, and you're seeing that type of profitability over that small amount of tonnage and keep in mind what this means, Kathryn: this is not with our most profitable business well yet. This is with our most profitable business starting to get well in Georgia and Florida and North Carolina. So we see the type of acceleration in those markets that I hope we'll see, then the types of margins that you've seen in this quarter and otherwise I believe will continue to replicate themselves, and we're more than comfortable with that 60% margin that we put out there. That's a long answer, but your question is a good one, and I wanted to be thorough with the response."

Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look at Colorado as a front-running state right now with a lot of room ahead of it. The employment picture in Colorado is very good. Denver is ranked 23rd nationally. There's a private sector that's really very strong. It's ranked 11th in housing starts. Their DOT program remains remarkably attractive. That's up 9% for the trailing 12 months. And again, what we're seeing there on downstream pricing continues to be very good. I think what our team in that marketplace has done with the ready-mix business is really impressive. If we come farther south and take a look at what's going on in Texas, remember, it's third in employment, it's up almost 900,000 jobs over the last 36 months. We've got I-35 in North Texas -- going DFW and Dallas and Fort Worth and obviously the Grand Parkway in Houston. And then we've got what we believe is going to be the coming of the $2.5 billion really hitting in '17 coming from Proposition 7. Another state or 2 to think about as long as we're still west of the Mississippi are both Iowa and Nebraska. And Iowa has been a remarkably consistent performer for us. But here's the pop we're going to see in Iowa. We're seeing higher gas taxes there. We're going to see DOT dollars up 30%. And we see a farm economy there this year that while some portions of the farm economy in fairness are down, we are seeing tremendous yields in the farm economy. So when we come back and look at tremendous yields and what that could mean in a Q4 or Q1, again weather-dependent, very good ag line circumstances. If we transition across the Mississippi River, let's talk about Florida for a second. Very positive; all segments are up; #2 in job growth; very strong DOT program; #1 in residential and #4 in nonres, which I know you asked me about. We'll hit more about that in just a second. The state of Georgia, I believe, finally, finally is starting to hit its stride. It's lagged Florida just a bit, but right now, it's #9 in job growth. It's #3 in residential. We're seeing a double of the DOT in that state. And we're going to start to feel that impact really even more profoundly late in '16. And the T-SPLOST program in South Georgia puts some much needed volume in that part of the state. And then lastly but certainly not least is what we're seeing here in our home state of North Carolina. What I would tell you is that state's really up and coming right now: #5 in employment. It's just past Georgia, in fact. It's #8 in single family. And what we're looking at right now on a trailing 12 months, at least through August, is we're seeing DOT awards up almost 47%, and we're seeing good work come up on HOT lanes in Charlotte right now. So if we look at those 6 states that are disproportionately important to us right now, I think that gives you a pretty good sense of where it is. Now the other part of your question, Kathryn, that I want to try to answer is really what's going on with nonres. Because again, if we're giving the sense that nonres is ill, that's not a sense that we're trying to give. Nonres, particularly on the heavy side, and I think that's where your question was, tend to be good, long-term multiyear jobs. So think of it in these terms. If we're looking at nonres construction, again, on a trailing 12-month basis, Florida is up 40%; North Carolina is up 18%; South Carolina is up 31%; and Colorado, which began its recovery well ahead of others, is up 7%. At the same time, if we look at some of those states and same percentage over a 3-year period, and again, I say that because they're multiyear, Florida up 54%, North Carolina up 11%, Georgia up 24%, and Texas up 85%. So again, if we're looking at heavy construction with years of tail to it, I think it's got a pretty good story. And then obviously, the story in the quarter relative to the light side of it that tends to follow housing was really a very attractive quarter, and again in the states that we believe are disproportionately important to us, we think will continue to be a good story. Did I hit what you needed on that?"

This is specifically with regard to nonres and on the fact that you're seeing the lighter nonres kind of follow through and certainly good performance in 3Q. But I mean that is where you trim the guidance for the year and the outlook -- the preliminary outlook for next year has kind of a slower pace of growth implied than what you've seen this year in nonres going from sort of we were at high single digits, now we're at low to mid-single digit, I can't remember exactly. And then you're talking about sort of slight growth next year. So what's the disconnect? I mean, why are we seeing a deceleration there?"

If you're looking at what's there and the volumes that we're likely to see on existing projects, again, that are multiyear, Todd, I think you can see a host of very strong multiyear projects that are already on the books. So really what I would tell you is this: Are we seeing a bit of a slowing in the trajectory of some of the growth in Texas? I think the answer is yes. But if you're looking at the numbers and the way growth has been in that state over the last several years, it's been so heady that it almost has to been naturally pull back while it's still growing. Now here's what I think the wildcard is. If you want to tell me or others want to say that, you know what, I think it's getting better in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida and South Carolina more quickly than you're saying. I'll take that because I think there's going to be nice growth in those states as well. But again, if you start seeing a higher rate of growth in heavy nonres in the Eastern United States, that's really going to be the swing factor in some of this because I think when we go to Texas and simply look at what's going on there or Colorado or Iowa or others, it's going to continue to be very healthy. We're simply talking about rates of growth, and we're already seeing volumes in some of those states that are at very, very good levels. So if you're doing a compare across our geography in trying to sort out where is there candidly continued room for growth. It's in the East much more so than it is in the West. And the East has been a slower, steady growth pattern really for the last 2 years, and you can see what the result is on the bottom line this year."

It's still a concern in markets like DFW and North Texas in particular. Because again, that economy, we talked about the fact that's the best single-family housing market in the United States.

At the same time, if I'm looking at it on a group-by-group basis, not surprisingly, we're seeing bigger price increases on a percentage basis in the Western United States in large part because there's room for that in the West because it's been lower.

First of all, let's talk about some of the dynamic that simply occurs because we're not going to be in cement in California anymore. So let's start with that and talk about the picture that you saw for the quarter because I think that's important to really understand and have context around. So 70% of the volume decline for the quarter was attributable to Riverside in California. So what you had immediately is when the deal is announced, you had certain customers who were seeing a change in that marketplace, who were seeing a nonvertically integrated player, ourselves, going away, and the downstream customers realigning themselves. So that was what we really saw in the quarter. We back away from that -- really, you're looking at cement volumes down 4%. Our quick snapshot is of the 4%, about 2% of that is cement that's no longer finding its weight of oil or the oil patch or others trying to find a home for some of that. And the other I think is directly to your point, Garik, and that is you do have a new importer right now in South Texas, and there has been some share that's gone there. What I think we're focused on is value right now. To your point, we're looking at a $12-a-ton price increase in April. We are the market leader in Texas, and we have a lot of conviction around that. As I look at what Texas capacity is and look at what Texas demand is, both in 2016 and 2017, I'm seeing something in '16 that's going to be close to 2.8 million tons of deficit. I'm seeing what people are projecting to be about a 3.2 million ton deficit as we go into '17. So as we're sitting here with what I feel like are very attractive and efficient plants, both in North Texas and Central Texas, I mean, here's what I'll tell you. What we have done relative to the efficiencies at Midlothian and Hunter during the time that we've been there I think is impressive. We can run plants in Texas as efficiently as anybody. If we want to go and get share, we can go and get share. That's not how I think we're going to put value for our shareholders today. And we're resilient on making sure that we're getting the price in that marketplace. I'm confident that we can. And the fact is, at certain levels, and I think this is where we are, price is more valuable than volume. So if you come back and take a look at what our performance was in the quarter, remember what I said in my comments. Our cement results were impressive. And we believe that. And I believe we've got a very good team. I think we've got superb locations. I think we've got great operations. And I think, given the dynamic in that marketplace, I feel pretty good about it, if you can't tell."

Frankly, if we look at what we see in Texas for next year, I think that's probably what you're pretty interested in, too. I got to say, I feel pretty good about it. I mean, if we break it down and look at it this way, Keith, I mean, North Texas, I think, the market there next year is better than it is this year in large part driven by very large projects. The horseshoe project in downtown Dallas as well as I-35 E and W are both going to be underway in North Texas in the Metroplex. State Highway 183 is very much underway. Even when we move farther south to Houston, part of what I look at is not just what we have awarded. And by the way, that's I-69 and Farm to Market Roads 1488 and 1774. And some of the work that we had, the Freeport LNG but really what's coming. And I'm seeing good work relative to the Harris County Tollway Authority. Good TxDOT work. Good work also at Bush airport. And then when we come down to South Texas and when looking at the large energy and infrastructure projects that, really, in my view, support a good business in 2016 and beyond at Cheniere, at the pipe plants, Harbor Bridge and otherwise. And the volume that I think we're going to see in Texas on these long-lived projects is really attractive. The other thing that I'm moved by in Texas right now is TxDOT already has a big budget. But if you spoke to the people at TxDOT, what they would tell you is it looks good; backlogs are good; going forward with work, it looks attractive; and by the way, when we start putting this Prop 7 money to it, it's going to feel like it's on some degree of steroids. So again, you're talking big numbers in a state that already has big numbers. But what it gives me a sense of, Keith, is it's likely to be healthy there for a good while going forward.

So the short answer is, unless some cement comes in, you simply can't meet the market demand. That said, I think the plants that are in that state are good efficient plants.

I mean, the -- one of the -- the Broad River came out of its banks and filled it up. And we'll pump it out, and we'll put it right back into the Broad River. The quarry happens to be a rail-connected quarry, and as you recall, Craig, we've got the largest rail-connected quarry system in the United States in the Aggregates business. So we can go into the marketplaces that can now not be served by North Columbia by rail from other quarries, and we can equally come into markets by boat. So from a market service perspective, I don't think we're going to be that affected by it. From an efficiency perspective, can we be affected by it? Yes. And I guess the other thing that I would say is insurance in circumstances like that is pretty difficult to have. So you in large part tend to be relatively self-insured. And so what I would tell you is there's going to be some capital that's going to be utilized in that as we go forward. And the other thing just in fairness, we did experience over the weekend pretty considerable rain events in Central and South Texas as well. And in our Webberville facility outside of Austin, we got a lot more water there than we typically would.
