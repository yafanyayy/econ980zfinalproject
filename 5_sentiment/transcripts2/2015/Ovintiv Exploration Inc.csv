We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, along with our 10-K. By now, I hope you've read through the information which included: Our fourth quarter earnings and operations results; our year end 2014 proved reserves; our well capital budget, along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year; and a detailed @NFX Publication, which includes lots of new information on our results today and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.
Since late last year, we've been laser focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 very clear. 
First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. We've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year and focused our dollars on our highest return area, the Anadarko Basin.
Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We work to production delineate more than 300 square miles and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent and we are delivering at 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.
Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is the leader in the area and we're building scale in our region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.
And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long-term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.
Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. 
In 2014, we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second-best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index, and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group. 
The Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig base and service cost reset to align with a new and lower near term oil price outlook.
The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the play's potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come.
We pushed well cost lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. And today's @NFX Publication, you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK was on a per foot basis for about half of what we drilled and completed these wells for 2012.
In today's @NFX, you'll see that our recent well results are outstanding. We're seeing significantly lower well cost, and we increased our STACK type curve by 20% or about 150,000 barrels in the 800,000 barrel figure to 950,000-barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage. 
Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with additional shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics. 
For us, the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year end proved reserves adjusted for asset sales. This translates to  our repeated greater than 250% and those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel, and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.
At year end 2014, our proved reserve was 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV-10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. Keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in nonstrategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.
Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.
We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. Our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets. And in late 2014, brought our Pearl field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015 while it's now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from 3 wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.
As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014, improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage going into 2015. 
And lastly, we advanced the elimination of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory, among the many STACK plays in the Uinta base we some very encouraging flow rates from the last Wasatch and Uteland Butte. And today, we disclosed our first well from a new play called the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts and the STACK geologic applies in the Anadarko Basin and in the Uinta that will be tested on the road ahead.
Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our most recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our Domestic business.
We've lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million or about $0.38 per share on the revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating committees before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million. 
Now to the 2015 outlook. Although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically, however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer, mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company and once again focus on higher growth when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels. 
The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production, and we can defer development without losing opportunities.
The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large high-quality asset that can put solid returns even at today's commodity prices.
We moved decisively in early 2014 to strengthen our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart at the current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015 and around $350 million in 2016.
Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. Our 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long-term rig or service contracts outside the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align costs with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today and we are focused on materially reducing these cost across our operating regions. 
Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We have high graded our investment into the Anadarko Basin and we're taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses. Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We've seen drilling and completions cost reduce by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year-end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date, and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year-end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year-to-date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full year G&A.
We have vigorous new initiatives under way across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment. Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth.
2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent, This equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10% adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32%, including China and 18% domestically.
Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter '14 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack, and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections. 
As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our nonoperated drilling activity is expected to remain high during the course of the year. 
Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We're drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015, that's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year, and we are not yet in development mode.
We're drilling wells cheaper, and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well cost for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well cost have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.
Billing to date has production delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development and projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. 
We recently increased the EURs for our STACK type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and cost averaged 30% to 40%. If service cost continue to drop, our returns should further improve and we show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX Publication.
In less than 4 years, we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. And we expect that our Anadarko Basin program will go more than 40% in 2015 and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day. The high grading of our 2015 investments required near term reductions and activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. 
Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014 and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from 4 rigs in 2014 to 1 rig in 2015. Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million, including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP, and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service cost align. 
The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta basin where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity. Our Greater Monument Butte unit is a conventional waterflood characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near term focus is on reducing our field level operating cost and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the Central Basin region in the Uinta, and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX.
We will see these wells will have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well cost and we achieved some significant investments in 2014.
The progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth with the basin growing at about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning of the year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production, and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.
Salt Lake City area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf, and we have firm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. Maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were elected to limit our future drilling, annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. 
Today, we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates and return at the corporate level.
Uinta Basin is a very large resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower cost, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work intent and we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future. 
As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. We feel there's high-quality options today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. We feel delivered outstanding operating results in 2014 and we continue a streak of solid execution across our company. 
Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are: to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find integrated ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio. 
Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts deep inventory locations that are held by production and we will be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound and we'll ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.

We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play, and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you, we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on.

What I was really excited about the results posted in 2014 is all of those high return high rate wells were 5,000 footers. So we do plan to allocate CapEx to the Springer as part of our SCOOP development activity in 2015, and we will be testing both 5,000 and 10,000-foot laterals. So I'll keep you apprised as the year unfolds, but we see it as a strong economic target that's part of the good news story in Anadarko Basin."

The first part, as far as how much do we need to see to have confidence in the forecast, I'll remind you and I think it's in the @NFX that first, we're drilling out here was late 2011. So we've got developing multi-year production forecast. We've had really, really strong performance across that period in terms of the actual results versus modeled performance that would be reservoir simulated modeled performance. We're upgrading the type curve in today's release, or in yesterday's release and today's call, by about 20%, that's a combination of targeting, locating within this section. It's a 700-foot thick overall section in the STACK. [indiscernible] is the top 400, 500 feet of the Meramec and the bottom portion is Woodford. We now have wells throughout that interval. And when you look at the map that's in @NFX, I think you'll be able to conclude that we're delivering good strong results across of the horizon and in both intervals. So frankly, as long as the statistical data says that the wells drilled into play more like the different, we'll probably keep it that way because it doesn't make any sense for us to have 15 different plays to try to talk to you guys about. We're giving the type curve that we think represent the play and I think the results delivered demonstrate that we're doing a good job predicting performance. I expect that it'll only get better from here."

We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, along with our 10-K. By now, I hope you've read through the information which included: Our fourth quarter earnings and operations results; our year end 2014 proved reserves; our 2015 capital budget, along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year; and a detailed @NFX publication, which includes lots of new information on our results today and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.
Since late last year, we've been laser focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 very clear. 
First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. We've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year, and focused our dollars on our highest return area, the Anadarko Basin.
Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We work to production delineate more than 300 square miles, and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent, and we are delivering at 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.
Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin, which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin, and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is the leader in the area, and we're building scale in our region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.
And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long-term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.
Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. 
In 2014, we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second-best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index, and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group. 
Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig rates and service cost reset to align with a new and lower near-term oil price outlook.
The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the play's potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come.
We pushed well costs lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. In today's @NFX publication, you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK wells on a per foot basis for about half of what we drilled and completed these wells for in 2012.
In today's @NFX, you'll see that our recent well results are outstanding. We're seeing significantly lower well cost, and we increased our STACK-type curve by 20%, or about 150,000 barrels in the 800,000 barrel figure to 950,000-barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage. 
Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics. 
For us, the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year end proved reserves adjusted for asset sales. This translates to an hour repeated greater than 250%, and those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel, and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.
At year end 2014, our proved reserve was 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV-10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. Keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in nonstrategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.
Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance, when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.
We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. Our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets. And in late 2014, brought our Pearl field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015. Pearl is now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from 3 wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.
As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014, improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage, going into 2015. 
And lastly, we advanced the elimination of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory, among the many STACK plays in the Uinta Basin, we saw some very encouraging flow rates from the Wasatch and Uteland Butte. And today, we disclosed our first well from a new play called the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts in the STACK geologic horizons in the Anadarko Basin, and in the Uinta that will be tested on the road ahead.
Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our most recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our Domestic business.
We've lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million, or about $0.38 per share on the revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million. 
Now to the 2015 outlook. Although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically, however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer, mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company to once again focus on higher growth, when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels. 
The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production, and we can defer development without losing opportunities.
The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large high-quality asset that can put solid returns even at today's commodity prices.
We moved decisively in early 2014 and strengthened our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart at the current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015, and around $350 million in 2016.
Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. The 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long-term rig or service contracts outside of the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align cost with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today, and we are focused on materially reducing these costs across our operating regions. 
Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We've high graded our investments into the Anadarko Basin, and we're taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses. Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We've seen drilling and completions cost, reduce by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date, and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year-to-date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full year G&A.
We have vigorous new initiatives under way across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment. Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth.
2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent, This equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10%, adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32%, including China and 18% domestically.
Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter '14 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack, and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections. 
As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our nonoperated drilling activity is expected to remain high, during the course of the year. 
Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We're drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015, that's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year, and we are not yet in development mode.
We're drilling wells cheaper, and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well cost for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well cost have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.
Billing to date has production delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. 
We recently increased the EURs for our STACK-type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and costs average 30% to 40%. As service costs continue to drop, our returns should further improve. We show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX Publication.
In less than 4 years, we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. And we expect that our Anadarko Basin program will grow more than 40% in 2015, and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day. The high grading of our 2015 investments required near-term reductions and activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. 
Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014, and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from 4 rigs in 2014 to 1 rig in 2015. Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million, including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP, and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service costs align. 
The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta basin, where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity. Our Greater Monument Butte Unit is a conventional waterflood characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near-term focus is on reducing our field level operating cost and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the Central Basin region in the Uinta, and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX.
We will see if these wells will have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well cost, and we achieved some significant advancements in 2014.
The progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth with the basin growing about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning of the year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production, and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.
Salt Lake City-area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf, and we have firm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. Maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were elected to limit our future drilling, annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. 
Today, we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic, just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates and return at the corporate level.
Uinta Basin is a very large oil resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower costs, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work intent, and then we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future. 
As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. Newfield has high-quality options today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. Newfield delivered outstanding operating results in 2014, and we continued a streak of solid execution across our company. 
Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are: to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue to improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find innovative ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio. 
Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts a deep inventory locations that are held by production, and we'll be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound, and we'll ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.

Our team has worked incredibly hard to reposition the company and this is not the result of waking up one morning and having good things happen. There's a lot of good hard work by a talented team. And I'm fortunate to work with and lead, so thank you for your comments. With regard to infills and density pilots, our team has continued to work, focused on HBP to drill wells, straddling lease lines. We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play, and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you, we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and the returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on. I'm excited about getting to that development phase, but we've got plenty of experience in multiple plays today with regard to spacing, so I think we've got a pretty good idea of what that plan will look like forward. We'll continue to work it. And with regard to HBP-ing the acreage and over the course of this year and moving into next year, we'll keep you guys surprised of the results, but I think you can look at that map on @NFX, and you can see the distribution of wells.

We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, along with our 10-K. By now, I hope you've read through the information, which included: Our fourth quarter earnings and operations results; our year end 2014 proved reserves; our 2015 capital budget, along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year; and a detailed @NFX publication, which includes lots of new information on our results today and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.
Since late last year, we've been laser focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 are very clear. 
First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. We've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year, and focused our dollars on our highest return area, the Anadarko Basin.
Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We work to production delineate more than 300 square miles, and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent, and we are delivering at 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.
Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin, which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin, and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is a leader in the area, and we're building scale in a region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.
And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long-term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.
Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. 
In 2014, we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second-best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index, and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group. 
Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig rates and service cost reset to align with a new and lower near-term oil price outlook.
The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the play's potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come.
We pushed well costs lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. In today's @NFX publication, you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK wells on a per foot basis for about half of what we drilled and completed these wells for in 2012.
In today's @NFX, you'll see that our recent well results are outstanding. We're seeing significantly lower well cost, and we increased our STACK-type curve by 20%, or about 150,000 barrels in the 800,000 barrel figure to 950,000-barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage. 
Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics. 
For us, the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year end proved reserves adjusted for asset sales. This translates to an R/P [ph] of greater than 250%, and those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel, and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.
At year end 2014, our proved reserve was 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV-10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. Keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in nonstrategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.
Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance, when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.
We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. Our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets. And in late 2014, brought our Pearl field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015. Pearl is now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from 3 wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.
As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014, improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage, going into 2015. 
And lastly, we advanced the elimination of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory, among the many STACK plays in the Uinta Basin, we saw some very encouraging flow rates from the Wasatch and Uteland Butte. And today, we disclosed our first well from a new play called the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts in the STACK geologic horizons in the Anadarko Basin, and in the Uinta that will be tested on the road ahead.
Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our most recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our Domestic business.
We've lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million, or about $0.38 per share on the revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million. 
Now to the 2015 outlook. Although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically, however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer, mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company to once again focus on higher growth, when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels. 
The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production, and we can defer development without losing opportunities.
The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large high-quality asset that can put solid returns even at today's commodity prices.
We moved decisively in early 2014 and strengthened our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart at the current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015, and around $350 million in 2016.
Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. The 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long-term rig or service contracts outside of the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align cost with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today, and we are focused on materially reducing these costs across our operating regions. 
Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We've high graded our investments into the Anadarko Basin, and we're taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses. Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We've seen drilling and completions costs reduce by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date, and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year-to-date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full year G&A.
We have vigorous new initiatives under way across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment. Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth.
2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent, this equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10%, adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32%, including China and 18% domestically.
Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter '14 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack, and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections. 
As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our nonoperated drilling activity is expected to remain high during the course of the year. 
Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We're drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015, that's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year, and we are not yet in development mode.
We're drilling wells cheaper, and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well cost for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well costs have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.
Drilling to date has production delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. 
We recently increased the EURs for our STACK-type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and costs average 30% to 40%. As service costs continue to drop, our returns should further improve. We show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX Publication.
In less than 4 years, we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. And we expect that our Anadarko Basin program will grow more than 40% in 2015, and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day. The high grading of our 2015 investments required near-term reductions and activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. 
Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014, and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from 4 rigs in 2014 to 1 rig in 2015. Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million, including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP, and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service costs align. 
The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta basin, where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity. Our Greater Monument Butte Unit is a conventional waterflood characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near-term focus is on reducing our field level operating cost and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the Central Basin region in the Uinta, and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX.
We will see if these wells have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well cost, and we achieved some significant advancements in 2014.
The progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth with the basin growing about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning of the year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production, and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.
Salt Lake City-area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf, and we have firm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. Maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were to elect to limit our future drilling, annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. 
Today, we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic, just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates and return at the corporate level.
Uinta Basin is a very large oil resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower costs, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work in tandem, and then we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future -- 
As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. Newfield has high-quality options today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. Newfield delivered outstanding operating results in 2014, and we continued a streak of solid execution across our company. 
Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are: to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue to improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find innovative ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio. 
Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts a deep inventory locations that are held by production, and we'll be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound, and we'll ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.

We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play, and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you, we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and the returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on.

The first part, as far as how much do we need to see to have confidence in the forecast, I'll remind you and I think it's in the @NFX that the first year of drilling out here was late 2011. So we've got developing multi-year production forecast. We've had really, really strong performance across that period in terms of the actual results versus modeled performance, that would be reservoir-simulated modeled performance. We're upgrading the type curve in today's release, or yesterday's release and today's call, by about 20%. That's a combination of targeting, locating within this section. It's a 700-foot thick overall section in the STACK. Top is -- top 400, 500 feet is the Meramec and the bottom portion is Woodford. We now have wells throughout that interval. And when you look at the map that's in @NFX, I think you'll be able to conclude that we're delivering good strong results across the horizon and in both intervals. So frankly, as long as the statistical data says that the wells drilled in the play are more alike than different, we'll probably keep it that way because it doesn't make any sense for us to have 15 different plays to try to talk to you guys about. We're giving you a type curve that we think represents the play, and I think the results delivered demonstrate that we're doing a good job predicting performance.

By now, I hope you've read through the information, which included: Our fourth quarter",2848,"Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining our Year End 2014 Conference Call. We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, along with our 10-K. By now, I hope you've read through the information, which included: Our fourth quarter earnings and operations results; our year end 2014 proved reserves; our 2015 capital budget, along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year; and a detailed @NFX publication, which includes lots of new information on our results today and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.
Since late last year, we've been laser focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 are very clear. 
First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. We've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year, and focused our dollars on our highest return area, the Anadarko Basin.
Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We work to production delineate more than 300 square miles, and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent, and we are delivering at 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.
Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin, which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin, and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is a leader in the area, and we're building scale in a region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.
And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long-term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.
Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. 
In 2014, we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second-best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index, and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group. 
Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig rates and service cost reset to align with a new and lower near-term oil price outlook.
The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the play's potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come.
We pushed well costs lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. In today's @NFX publication, you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK wells on a per foot basis for about half of what we drilled and completed these wells for in 2012.
In today's @NFX, you'll see that our recent well results are outstanding. We're seeing significantly lower well cost, and we increased our STACK-type curve by 20%, or about 150,000 barrels in the 800,000 barrel figure to 950,000-barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage. 
Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics. 
For us, the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year end proved reserves adjusted for asset sales. This translates to an R/P [ph] of greater than 250%, and those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel, and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.
At year end 2014, our proved reserve was 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV-10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. Keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in nonstrategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.
Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance, when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.
We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. Our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets. And in late 2014, brought our Pearl field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015. Pearl is now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from 3 wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.
As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014, improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage, going into 2015. 
And lastly, we advanced the elimination of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory, among the many STACK plays in the Uinta Basin, we saw some very encouraging flow rates from the Wasatch and Uteland Butte. And today, we disclosed our first well from a new play called the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts in the STACK geologic horizons in the Anadarko Basin, and in the Uinta that will be tested on the road ahead.
Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our most recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our Domestic business.
We've lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million, or about $0.38 per share on the revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million. 
Now to the 2015 outlook. Although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically, however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer, mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company to once again focus on higher growth, when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels. 
The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production, and we can defer development without losing opportunities.
The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large high-quality asset that can put solid returns even at today's commodity prices.
We moved decisively in early 2014 and strengthened our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart at the current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015, and around $350 million in 2016.
Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. The 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long-term rig or service contracts outside of the Anadarko Basin. Today, we're working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align cost with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today, and we are focused on materially reducing these costs across our operating regions. 
Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We've high graded our investments into the Anadarko Basin, and we're taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses. Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We've seen drilling and completions costs reduce by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date, and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year-to-date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full year G&A.
We have vigorous new initiatives under way across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment. Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth.
2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent, this equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10%, adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32%, including China and 18% domestically.
Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter '14 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack, and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections. 
As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our nonoperated drilling activity is expected to remain high during the course of the year. 
Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We're drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015, that's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year, and we are not yet in development mode.
We're drilling wells cheaper, and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well cost for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well costs have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.
Drilling to date has production delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. 
We recently increased the EURs for our STACK-type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and costs average 30% to 40%. As service costs continue to drop, our returns should further improve. We show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX Publication.
In less than 4 years, we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. And we expect that our Anadarko Basin program will grow more than 40% in 2015, and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day. The high grading of our 2015 investments required near-term reductions and activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. 
Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014, and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from 4 rigs in 2014 to 1 rig in 2015. Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million, including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP, and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service costs align. 
The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta basin, where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity. Our Greater Monument Butte Unit is a conventional waterflood characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near-term focus is on reducing our field level operating cost and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the Central Basin region in the Uinta, and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX.
We will see if these wells have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well cost, and we achieved some significant advancements in 2014.
The progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth with the basin growing about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning of the year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production, and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.
Salt Lake City-area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf, and we have firm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. Maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were to elect to limit our future drilling, annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. 
Today, we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic, just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates and return at the corporate level.
Uinta Basin is a very large oil resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower costs, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work in tandem, and then we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future -- 
As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. Newfield has high-quality options today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. Newfield delivered outstanding operating results in 2014, and we continued a streak of solid execution across our company. 
Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are: to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue to improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find innovative ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio. 
Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts a deep inventory locations that are held by production, and we'll be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound, and we'll ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.

And I'm fortunate to work with and lead, so thank you for your comments. With regard to infills and density pilots, our team has continued to work, focused on HBP to drill wells, straddling lease lines. We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play, and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you, we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and the returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on. I'm excited about getting to that development phase, but we've got plenty of experience in multiple plays today with regard to spacing, so I think we've got a pretty good idea of what that plan will look like forward.

We're off to a very good start in 2015, and we are on course to deliver on our business plan. Our in is very clear. First, our plan aligns and our investments levels with our expected cash flows to date and maintain financial strength and liquidity. We right size our investment levels and shift the lion's share of our capital at the Anadarko Basin, where we're seeing very strong and improving rates of return. We executed 3 very important financial transactions during the quarter that put us in a very strong position today. 
We issued equity and paid off our credit facility, issued new 10-year senior notes at an attractive 5.375%. In April 2015, we retired a commensurate amount of debt due in 2020, and we outsized our credit facility by $400 million to $1.8 billion and extended its term by 2 years to 2020. 
These transactions were carefully considered, and we see them as the right steps in today's outlook for lower oil prices. Second, we are focused on drilling STACK, to hold our large acreage position by production. Our confidence in the scale and economic success of STACK continues to grow with each well. You'll hear more in today's call to support our encouragement around the Anadarko Basin and its potential to drive our corporate growth well into the future. 
And lastly, we're now positioned to ramp up activities in SCOOP and STACK at the right time. We recently announced the combination of our Rockies and onshore Gulf Coast business units into 1 operating region, allowing us to expedite the shift of both human and capital resources into the Anadarko Basin as well as reduce future G&A cost and realize greater efficiencies. Rest assured as we continued to see improving margins we will again focus an even stronger levels of liquids production and cash flow growth. We have the people in place today to execute our future plans. Before I provide an overview the progress are making in the Anadarko Basin, I'll turn the call over to Larry Massaro to provide a quick summary of our first quarter operating and financial results."

As we close out the first quarter, we're executing extremely well. The 2015 operating plan is intact, and we are on course to deliver our key objectives, which is to combine growth within improving cost structure.",609,"Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. As we close out the first quarter, we're executing extremely well. The 2015 operating plan is intact, and we are on course to deliver our key objectives, which is to combine growth within improving cost structure. We entered this year quickly what was a $1.7 billion investment rate as rigs operating across 4 basins. We quickly reduced our budget to $1.2 billion and aligned it with expected cash flows. This reallocation reduced activity in South Texas and the Rockies while shifting capital to our highest return plays in the Anadarko Basin. 
From a cash flow statement, it appeared that we invested about $500 million in the quarter, about 20% of this was simply cash payments from 2014 capital investment. We actually invested about $400 million in the first quarter as we wound down drilling programs and completed an inventory wells that carried across year end. We expected our fourth quarter 2015 investment level to as low to about $250 million a for the remainder of the year, we expect the run 1 rig in the Williston Basin and 10 rigs in the Anadarko Basin. 
Our production in the first quarter top to midpoint of our guidance by 300,000 barrels [indiscernible]  12.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production was 11.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 21%. 
More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 26% year-over-year. In our guidance, note that our second quarter domestic production is expected to grow 5% over the quarter. Discretionary cash flow from operations is $255 million or about $1.76 per share, topping consensus estimates. 
Net income for the quarter, excluding several onetime item detailed in our earnings release was $0.02 per share. Most significant item was a noncash ceiling write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full-cost company with this chart with certain expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-K. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. We expect another seal and test write-down in the second quarter as $90 oil prices in 2014 are replaced with significantly lower 2015 prices in the 12-month trailing average. 
Our plan for 2015. Projects improving cash operating cost of the year with taken the right steps to date to lower our cost structure and improve margins across the company. Our first quarter domestic lease operating expense per barrel equivalent dropped more than 15% over the prior year. Our G&A expense will benefit from our recent reorganization and headcount reductions. Excluding the onetime costs associated with these actions, we estimate that our G&A expense will fall by about 15% or more than $40 million in 2016 and beyond. Our interest expense will also benefit by $10 million per year due to lower rates on our recently issued senior notes. These are significant positive changes to our cost structure in future periods. As Lee mentioned in his opening remarks, the capital market transactions we executed in the first quarter were well timed, allowing us to navigate uncertain market conditions. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had nothing drawn on our revolver. With about $2 billion of liquidity, our capital structure is the best it has been in more than a decade. Our focus this year will remain: Profitable growth, continued cost structure improvement, getting the STACK ABP and ready to deliver strong future growth as we prepare for full field development and maintaining balance sheet integrity. I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our Anadarko Basin."

I'd like to spend the remainder of today's call on the Anadarko Basin. I'd to specifically share some additional information on you on why we are gaining more confidence in this plays ability to deliver corporate growth for years to come. W",1327,"Thanks, Larry. I'd like to spend the remainder of today's call on the Anadarko Basin. I'd to specifically share some additional information on you on why we are gaining more confidence in this plays ability to deliver corporate growth for years to come. We're on track to deliver 45% production growth from the Anadarko Basin in 2015. We expect that our first quarter average net rate, 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day will grow to an average of 57,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, and we expect to exit the year at more than 68,000 BOE per day. A slight drop in our first quarter daily average is simply related to the timing of pad completions and plant shut ins for offsetting completions. 
Rest assured, we're on track to deliver our growth projections in 2015. While excited about this growth, we're even more excited about our increasing rates of return, improving productivity of our wells and the data we were obtaining from a large number of STACK wells that have now been online for 2 years or more. 
Let me provide a few distinct examples to help you better understand our excitement and growing confidence levels in the value of STACK. Our well results continue to get better. 
On Slide 7 in the FX publication, we included 6 STACK wells that on average have higher 30-, 60- and 90-day production rates in our 2014 wells and more than 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the 30- and 60-day average rates; and 765 barrels of oil equivalent per day for an average 90-day rate. Overall percentage on a well head  basis was about 80% over the first 30 days and averaged 74% oil over the first 90 days. The wells validate our type curve increase at year end 2014. These wells were drilled across 3 separate townships, and we continue to see very consistent and repeatable results as we work to HBP our acreage. When you average the 30 STACK wells we have released over the last 2 years, the 30-day average oil percentage is greater than 80%. Again, this is an oil play, and our acreage was purposely assembled in the up-dip portion of the play in what we call, the oil window. This is the area that we targeted, and we're really proud to own it today. As you move South from West towards the traditional Cana play, one would expect the gas cuts to become materially higher. We have about 100 wells planned for the Anadarko Basin for 2015, where we're gathering data very quickly. There are an additional 15 operated wells in the basin that have recently commenced production or in various stages of completion. We look forward to sharing more long-term production history with you around midyear. 
Let me comment on initiatives that has come up in a few of our investor meetings and discussions. Gas oil ratio or GOR. We are seeing very high oil production in the early life of our wells. This production is holding up extremely well in our longest dated wells. Our oldest well was drilled 4 years ago to test the STACK concept. After 4 years, that well is still producing 62% crack oil. In addition, our first -- in addition to the first STACK test, we also had the benefit of more than 2,000 vertical wells drilled and completed over the last half-century. These wells have production from a multitude of shallower horizon, all sourced by the Woodford formation, one of the nation's most prolific source rocks. And this large data set of legacy vertical producers is representative sample across our acreage position and examine the GOR overtime. Although the oil volumes from these vertical wells aren't impressive by today's standards, what was impressive was the consistency of the GOR over the life of the wells. 
On Slide 8, at @NFX, we shared our original 6-well sample with you. We used this information to create our type curve assumptions. To date, our 4 oldest wells, which now have at least 2 years of production history have performed in line with our forecast GOR. The GOR is remarkably consistent with our sample of legacy vertical wells and with our early type curve assumptions in STACK. Our model GOR assumptions appear to be very sound. 
Recall that our economic assumptions for the STACK play assume an average oil yield of about 40% over the life of the well. That's a 3-strain production, representing 40% oil, 30% NGLs, that would be 70% total liquids over the life of the well, the balance being 30% natural gas. 
You know that the GOR will increase over time, and we feel that our forecast are in line with our expectations and performance observed to date. We believe that Newfield controls the best acreage in the play. As you move West, again, we expect the play to, ultimately, transition to dry gas original lease capture was focused on the oil window. But make no mistake. Plays on our STACK acreage are oil plays. Slide 9 shows that the initial oil and STACK are very high. Over the first 5 years, we estimate we will produce about 60% of the total recoverable oil and nearly 80% in the first 10 years. A high initial oil rates in the early of these wells, materially enhance our returns even at the budgeted $60 3-year average oil outlook. 
Slide 10 shows the first year economics of the STACK well computed in a 3-stream basis. Our production is reported as  well head production or 2-stream, oil and natural gas. But it's important that you understand the economic uplift created by 3-stream processing. Operating teams in the Anadarko Basin are doing a fantastic job today, and we are leading the industry. Initial learnings from our SCOOP development have been rapidly applied to STACK. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for about $8.5 million gross, already in line with our full year average forecast. The well costs were down nearly 50% on a cost per lateral foot basis over the last 3 years, and we're excited about where we maybe by year end 2015. 
Drill price lies in development, but we are certain that significant savings can be realized. There's no better comparison than Williston, which is now in full development. Our 10,000-foot lateral wells in the Williston today are being drilled in just 15 days, and common pad locations for an industry-leading low cost of  less than $6 million, including facility cost. Our final point today  plays a significant resource potential in stacking, development horizons and development wells in multiple horizons across our acreage. The STACK play ahs more than 700 feet of oil-saturated column in the Woodford and Meramec shale. Our confidence in well performance was demonstrated at year end, and we increased our STACK type curve by 20% through our current estimate, 950,000 barrels. And to date, we've completed 4 spacing tests in STACK, all with very encouraging early results. As illustrated on Slide 11 in @NFX, we now have tests in the Woodford-Woodford, Meramec-Meramec and Woodford-Meramec as tight as a 880 feet apart horizontally and 175 feet apart vertically. Although it's way too early for definitive conclusions, the average for these 8 wells has performed in line with our 950,000 BOE type curve. And 3 additional operated spacing tests were planned later this year. 
We kept our remarks brief this morning to leave ample time for your questions. I will close simply by saying, Newfield has high-quality options in SCOOP in STACK today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we position the company to compete and win in today's environment and accelerate development in the future. 
To date, we have delivered outstanding operating results, and we intend to deliver on our full year objectives. Thanks for your investment in our company, and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

I think you've 3 or 4 questions in 2, so I on that as well on Friday. I'll try to cover them all. So first on $8.5 million. We're super pleased to be in $8.5 million at the end of the first quarter. Wh",451,"Okay well, so much, good to talk to you this morning. I think you've 3 or 4 questions in 2, so I on that as well on Friday. I'll try to cover them all. So first on $8.5 million. We're super pleased to be in $8.5 million at the end of the first quarter. When you think about the forecast that they put forth at the beginning of the year, we were thinking $8.5 million would be a good average outcome for the year. So I would tell you that we're ahead of schedule. Of the savings that had been realized to date to get to that $8.5 million, it's split about half service costs and half efficiency gains. So the part we really like is the efficiency gains equation because that's the piece that we get to hold onto when market conditions turn and commodity prices rise again. So ahead of expectations year-to-date. I indicated we think that we will have additional gains as the year unfolds. We also's have the benefit -- we had a lot of carryover activity into the quarter that would be included in those cost, and we hope to see a better run rate as we approach midyear. So look forward to us giving you an update midyear, and we'll give you some clarity on what we think the balance of the year is going to be. As far as the STACK play, the Meramec sections stand out at where we're at, let's say, it's 300 to 500 feet thick. Generally, the Woodford sections, 150 to 200 feet thick. We talk about it as being a 700-foot thick oil-saturated section. When we acquired the acreage position, we set out to buy. We didn't buy edges. So as you move away from our acreage position, north, south and east, you do approach edges, but we don't have material hedges, if you will from conventional standpoint within our acreage footprint. That's positive I think that's one of the contributors to the consistent results that we're seeing across the acreage block, and I would bet that at the end of the day that we'll develop horizons that will be somewhere between 100 to 200-foot thick target in furlongs ended regard to targeting within the section, we've not worked out all of the details yet in terms of specific windows, but clearly, the teams got the ability and the land in 10, 20-foot horizons and stay there over the 10,000-foot lateral, but generally what you all think about is how many layers can we develop in the 700-foot section.

To really understand what's going on in SCOOP, the summary of it is. It's just a function that we have more oil and less gas, and therefore, on a BOE basis, it's translating to what appears to be a lower number. If you wanted a little bit more granularity on that, when you actually look at the oil phase that we're pursuing out there, we really only drilled 1 well there and that particular well, it was a slightly longer well, but it was one of the furthest east wells we've drilled. And as we moved east in the play, we pick up higher oil percentage. In this case, we actually had  a 61% oil cut versus the prior year of about 50% or so. If we move into the wet gas, last year, we had a considerable number of wells that were redrilled, and those wells produced about 26% oil cut. This year, the wells that we drilled, the 5 that we reported, were at 30%  and that's really a portion of choke management. What the teams have developed, and we've been talking about this for quite a while, reducing our drawdowns and holding these wells back a little bit earlier on, and we're finding one and some of the additional benefits, not only in increasing our EUR is the fact we're actually getting a higher liquids cut in the separator as a result of that.

We're off to a very good start in 2015, and we are on course to deliver on our business plan. The parties in this plan are very clear. First, our plan aligns our investments levels with our expected cash flows today and ensures we maintain financial strength and liquidity. We right-sized our investment levels and shifted the lion's share of our capitals in the Anadarko Basin, where are seeing very strong and improving rates of return. We executed 3 very important financial transactions during the quarter. That put us in a very strong position today.
We issued equity and paid off our credit facility, issued new tenure senior notes in an attractive 5 3/8%. And in April 2015, we retired a commensurate amount of debt due in 2020. And we upsized our credit facility by $400 million to $1.8 billion, and extended its term by 2 years to 2020. These transactions were carefully considered, and we see them as the right steps in today's outlook for lower oil prices.
Second, we are focused on drilling in STACK to hold our large acreage position by production. Our confidence in the scale and economic success of STACK continues to grow with each well. You'll hear more in today's call to support our encouragement around the Anadarko Basin and its potential to drive our corporate growth well into the future.
And lastly, we're now positioned to ramp up activities in SCOOP and STACK at the right time. We recently announced the combination of our Rockies and onshore Gulf Coast business units into 1 operating region, allowing us to expedite the shift of both human and capital resources into the Anadarko Basin as well as reduce future G&A cost and realize greater efficiencies.
Be assured, as we continue to see improving margins, we will again focus on even stronger levels of liquids production and cash flow growth. We have the people in place today to execute our future plans.
Before I provide an overview of the progress we are making in the Anadarko Basin, I'll turn the call over to Larry Massaro to provide a quick summary of our first quarter operating and financial results."

As we close out the first quarter, we are executing extremely well. Our 2015 operating plan is intact, and we are on course to deliver our key objectives, which combine growth with an improving cost structure. We entered this year quickly slowing what was a $1.7 billion investment rate, with rigs operating across 4 basins. We quickly reduced our budget to $1.2 billion and aligned it with expected cash flows. This reallocation reduced activity in South Texas and the Rockies, while shifting capital to our highest return plays in the Anadarko Basin.
On the cash flow statement, it appeared that we invested about $500 million in the quarter. About 20% of this was simply cash payments from 2014 capital investments. We actually invested about $400 million in the first quarter as we wound down drilling programs and completed an inventory of wells that carried across year end. We expect that our fourth quarter 2015 investment level will slow to about $250 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect the run 1 rig in the Williston Basin and 10 rigs in the Anadarko Basin.
Our production in the first quarter topped the midpoint of our guidance by 300,000 barrels, totaling 12.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production was 11.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 21%.
More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 26% year-over-year. In our guidance, note that our second quarter domestic production is expected to grow 5% over the quarter. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $255 million or about $1.76 per share, topping consensus estimates.
Net income for the quarter, excluding several onetime items detailed in our earnings release, was $0.02 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full-cost company, this charge was certain expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-K. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. We expect another ceiling test write-down in the second quarter as $90 oil prices in 2014 are replaced with significantly lower 2015 prices in the 12-month trailing average.
Our plan for 2015. Projects improving cash operating cost throughout the year. We are taking the right steps today to lower our cost structure and improve margins across the company. Our first quarter domestic lease operating expense per barrel equivalent dropped more than 15% over the prior year. Our G&A expense will benefit from our recent reorganization and headcount reductions. Excluding the onetime costs associated with these actions, we estimate that our G&A expense will fall by about 15% or more than $40 million in 2016 and beyond. Our interest expense will also benefit by $10 million per year due to lower rates on our recently issued senior notes. These are significant positive changes to our cost structure in future periods. As Lee mentioned in his opening remarks, the capital market transactions we executed in the first quarter were well-timed, allowing us to navigate uncertain market conditions.
At the end of the first quarter, we had nothing drawn on our revolver. With about $2 billion of liquidity, our capital structure is the best it has been in more than a decade. The focus this year will remain: profitable growth, continued cost structure improvement, getting the STACK HBP and ready to deliver strong future growth as we prepare for full field development and maintaining balance sheet integrity.
I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our Anadarko Basin."

I'd like to spend the remainder of today's call on the Anadarko Basin. More specifically, share some additional information with you on why we are gaining more confidence and displays the ability to deliver corporate growth for years to come. We're on track to deliver 45% production growth from the Anadarko Basin in 2015. We expect that our first quarter average net rate, 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, will grow to an average of 57,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, and we expect to exit the year at more than 68,000 BOE per day. The slight drop in our first quarter daily average is simply related to the timing of pad completions and plant shut-ins for offsetting completions. Be assured, we're on track to deliver our growth projections in 2015.
While excited about this growth, we're even more excited about our increasing rates of return, the improving productivity of our wells and the data we were obtaining from a large number of STACK wells that had now been online for 2 years or more.
Let me provide a few distinct examples to help you better understand our excitement and growing confidence levels in the value of STACK. Our well results continue to get better.
On Slide 7 in the @FX publication, we included 6 STACK wells, that on average, have higher 30-, 60- and 90-day production rates than our 2014 wells had more than 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the 30- and 60-day average rates and 765 barrels of oil equivalent per day for an average 90-day rate. The oil percentage on a well head basis was about 80% over the first 30 days and averaged 74% oil over the first 90 days. The wells validate our type-curve increase at year-end 2014. These wells were drilled across 3 separate townships, and we continue to see very consistent and repeatable results as we work to HBP our acreage. When you average the 30 STACK wells we have released over the last 2 years, the 30-day average oil percentage is greater than 80%. Again, this is an oil play, and our acreage was purposely assembled in the up-dip portion of the play in what we call the oil window. This is the area that we targeted, and we're really proud to own it today.
As you move south and west towards the traditional Cana play, one would expect the gas cuts to become materially higher. We have about 100 wells planned for the Anadarko Basin in 2015, where we're gathering data very quickly. There are an additional 15 operated wells in the basin that have recently commenced production or in various stages of completion. We look forward to sharing more long-term production history with you around midyear.
Let me comment on our initiatives that has come up in a few of our investor meetings and discussions. Gas oil ratio or GOR. We're seeing very high oil production in the early life of our wells, and this production is holding up extremely well in our longest dated wells. Our oldest well was drilled 4 years ago to test the STACK concept. After 4 years, that well is still producing 62% flank oil.
In addition, our first -- in addition to the first STACK test, we also had the benefit of more than 2,000 vertical wells drilled and completed over the last half-century. These wells had combing of production from a multitude of shallower horizons, all sourced by the Woodford formation, one of the nation's most prolific source rocks. From this large data set of legacy vertical producers, we took a representative sample across our acreage position and examined the GOR over time. Although the oil volumes from these vertical wells weren't impressive by today's standards, what was impressive was the consistency of the GOR over the life of the wells.
On Slide 8, in @NFX, we shared our original 6-well sample with you. We used this information to create our type curve assumptions. To date, our 4 oldest wells, which now have at least 2 years of production history, have performed in line with our forecast GOR. The GOR is remarkably consistent with our sample of legacy vertical wells and with our early type curve assumptions in STACK. Our model GOR assumptions appear to be very sound.
Recall that our economic assumptions for the STACK play assume an average oil yield of about 40% over the life of the well. That's a 3-strain production, representing 40% oil, 30% NGLs, that'd be a 70% total liquids over the life of the well, the balance being 30% natural gas.
We know that the GOR will increase over time, and we feel that our forecast are in line with our expectations and performance observed to date. We believe that Newfield controls the best acreage in the play. And as you move west, again we expect the play to ultimately transition to dry gas original, our original lease capture was focused on the oil window.
So make no mistake. The plays on our STACK acreage are oil plays. Slide 9 shows that the initial oil kins and STACK are very high. Over the first 5 years, we estimate we will produce about 60% of the total recoverable oil and nearly 80% in the first 10 years. The high initial oil rates in the early life of these wells materially enhance our returns, even at the budgeted $60 3-year average oil outlook.
Slide 10 shows the first year economics of the STACK well computed on a 3-stream basis. Our production is reported as well head production or 2-stream, oil and natural gas. But it's important that you understand the economic uplift created by 3-stream processing. Operating teams in the Anadarko Basin are doing a fantastic job today, and we are leading the industry. The initial learnings from our SCOOP development had been rapidly applied to STACK. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for about $8.5 million gross, already in line with our full year average forecast. Our well costs are down nearly 50% on a cost-per-lateral foot basis over the last 3 years, and we're excited about where we may be by year-end 2015.
The real price lies in development mode, where we are certain that significant savings can be realized. There's no better comparison to Williston, which is now in full development. Our 10,000-foot lateral wells in the Williston are today being drilled in just 15 days from common pad locations for an industry-leading low cost of less than $6 million, including facility cost.
My final point today relates to the significant resource potential in stacking, development horizons and development wells in multiple horizons across our acreage. The STACK play has more than 700 feet of oil-saturated column in the Woodford and Meramec shales. Our confidence in well performance was demonstrated at year end when we increased our STACK type curve by 20% through our current estimate of 950,000 barrels. To date, we have completed 4 spacing tests in STACK, all with very encouraging early results.
As illustrated on Slide 11 in @NFX, we now have tests in the Woodford-Woodford, Meramec-Meramec and Woodford-Meramec, as tight as a 880 feet apart horizontally and 175 feet apart vertically. Although it's way too early for definitive conclusions, the average for these 8 wells has performed in line with our 950,000 BOE type curve, and 3 additional operated spacing tests are planned later this year.
We kept our remarks brief this morning to leave ample time for your questions. I will close simply by saying Newfield has high-quality options in SCOOP in STACK today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we position the company to compete and win in today's environment and accelerate development in the future.
To date, we have delivered outstanding operating results, and we intend to deliver on our full year objectives.

I think you've got 3 or 4 questions in 2, so I complement you on that as well. I'll try to cover them all. So first one on $8.5 million. We're super pleased to be at $8.5 million at the end of the first quarter. When you think about the forecast that we put forth at the beginning of the year, we were thinking $8.5 million would be a good average outcome for the year. So I would tell you that we're ahead of schedule. Of the savings that had been realized to date to get to that $8.5 million, it split about half service cost and half efficiency gains. So the part we really like is the efficiency gain side of the equation, because that's the piece that we get to hold on to when market conditions turn and commodity prices rise again. So ahead of expectations year-to-date. I indicated we think that we'll have additional gains as the year unfolds. We also have the benefit of -- we had a lot of carryover activity into the quarter, that would be included in those cost. And we hope to see a better run rate as we approach midyear. So look forward to us giving you an update midyear, and we'll give you some clarity on what we think the balance of the year is going to be. As far as the STACK play, the Meramec sections, depending on where you're at, let's say, it's 300 to 500 feet thick. Generally, the Woodford section's 150, 200 feet thick. We talked about it as being a 700-foot thick oil-saturated section. When we acquired the acreage position, we set out to buy it. We didn't buy edges. So as you move away from our acreage position, north, south and east, you do approach edges. But we don't have material edges, if you will, from a conventional standpoint within our acreage footprint, so that's positive. I think that's one of the contributors to the consistent results that we're seeing across the acreage block. And I would bet in the end of the day that we'll develop horizons that will be somewhere between 100- to 200-foot thick target intervals. And with regard to targeting within the section, we've not worked out all of the details yet in terms of specific windows. But clearly, the team's got the ability to land in 10-, 20-foot horizons and stay there over the 10,000-foot lateral. But generally, how I think about it is how many layers can we develop in the 700-foot section. We've got to drill additional spacing test to get more definitive data there to give you an answer on that."

I think the 2015 plan is shaping up well at this stage, and we like where we sit. It was a great deal of activity in the SCOOP. Today, down in the south, it's both operated and nonoperated. What you can't see and maybe don't fully appreciate at all, the little logistical challenges when everybody is getting in, starting to develop out their drilling spacing units. So there are periods that you have to plan for shut-ins and other activities, along with the normal sequencing with regard to pad drilling. So we've got 2 other variables there that, in a perfect world, you wouldn't have to deal with. So we're shutting our wells in when offset operators are completing theirs. Their shutting their's in when we're completing ours. And that's part of everybody that's playing down there is production forecast at this point. So I'd tell you that's something we do take into account. I think the second quarter does give you some indications. We see a nice uptick in production. And certainly, you've got a commitment.

We think things could develop where when we can actually accelerate the HBP, which would allow us to accelerate development. And certainly, the payoff for our investors is getting to the development stage in the play. So that's #1 on our list. Clearly coring up our lease positions -- I mean throughout our history, we've had to do that. I think it makes sense. It's something that we want to do. We think we've identified the core of the play. We know where we want to be in that regard, and we're going to continue to stay focused on that. As for deals, we continue to look. But I'd tell you, given the slight rise in the commodity prices, I think that in today's world, many of the sellers have what we believe are very unrealistic expectations. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that maybe even sky-high expectations. So in that regard, we'll stay in the game. But Newfield's not going to make an investment that doesn't make sense."

To really understand what's going on in SCOOP, the summary of it is it's just a function that we have more oil and less gas. And therefore on a BOE basis, it's translating to what appears to be a lower number. If you wanted a little bit more granularity on that, when you actually look at the oil phase that we're pursuing out there, we really only drilled 1 well there. And that particular well, it was a slightly longer well, but it was one of the furthest east wells we've drilled. And as we moved east in the play, we pick up a higher oil percentage. In this case, we actually had a 61% oil cut versus the prior year, had about 50% or so. When you move into the wet gas, last year, we had a considerable number of wells that were redrilled, and those wells produced at about 26% oil cut. This year, the wells that we drilled, the 5 that we reported, were at 30% oil cut. And that's really a function of choke management. What the teams have developed, and we've been talking about this for quite a while, reducing our drawdowns and holding these wells back a little bit earlier on. And we're finding one and some of the additional benefits, not only in increasing our EUR, is the fact we're actually getting a higher liquids cut in the separator as a result of that.

Our COO, Gary Packer, and the remainder of our executive team will also be available to answer your detailed questions at the end of today's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]
Before handing the call over to Lee, let me make a couple of comments. We issued a detailed @NFX publication last night, along with our earnings release, and we will reference some of these slides this morning.
As you know, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website, along with the earnings release, the financial tables and our non-GAAP reconciliations. As always, today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and these are based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer for you is located in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-K.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby."

We're off to a very good start in 2015, and we are on course to deliver on our business plan. The priorities in this plan are very clear. First, our plan aligns our investment levels with our expected cash flows today and ensures we maintain financial strength and liquidity. We right-sized our investment levels and shifted the lion's share of our capital to the Anadarko Basin, where are seeing very strong and improving rates of return. We executed 3 very important financial transactions during the quarter that put us in a very strong position today.
We issued equity and paid off our credit facility, issued new 10-year senior notes at an attractive 5 3/8%. And in April 2015, we retired a commensurate amount of debt due in 2020. And we upsized our credit facility by $400 million to $1.8 billion, and extended its term by 2 years to 2020. These transactions were carefully considered, and we see them as the right steps in today's outlook for lower oil prices.
Second, we are focused on drilling in STACK to hold our large acreage position by production. Our confidence in the scale and economic success of STACK continues to grow with each well. You'll hear more in today's call to support our encouragement around the Anadarko Basin and its potential to drive our corporate growth well into the future.
And lastly, we're now positioned to ramp up activities in SCOOP and STACK at the right time. We recently announced the combination of our Rockies and onshore Gulf Coast business units into 1 operating region, allowing us to expedite the shift of both human and capital resources into the Anadarko Basin as well as reduce future G&A cost and realize greater efficiencies.
Be assured, as we continue to see improving margins, we will again focus on even stronger levels of liquids production and cash flow growth. We have the people in place today to execute our future plans.
Before I provide an overview of the progress we are making in the Anadarko Basin, I'll turn the call over to Larry Massaro to provide a quick summary of our first quarter operating and financial results."

Our 2015 operating plan is intact, and we are on course to deliver our key objectives, which combine growth with an improving cost structure. We",608,"Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone.
As we close out the first quarter, we are executing extremely well. Our 2015 operating plan is intact, and we are on course to deliver our key objectives, which combine growth with an improving cost structure. We entered this year quickly slowing what was a $1.7 billion investment rate, with rigs operating across 4 basins. We quickly reduced our budget to $1.2 billion and aligned it with expected cash flows. This reallocation reduced activity in South Texas and the Rockies, while shifting capital to our highest-return plays in the Anadarko Basin.
On the cash flow statement, it appeared that we invested about $500 million in the quarter. About 20% of this was simply cash payments from 2014 capital investments. We actually invested about $400 million in the first quarter as we wound down drilling programs and completed an inventory of wells that carried across year-end. We expect that our fourth quarter 2015 investment level will slow to about $250 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect to run 1 rig in the Williston Basin and 10 rigs in the Anadarko Basin.
Our production in the first quarter topped the midpoint of our guidance by 300,000 barrels, totaling 12.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production was 11.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 21%.
More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 26% year-over-year. In our guidance, note that our second quarter domestic production is expected to grow 5% over the quarter. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $255 million or about $1.76 per share, topping consensus estimates.
Net income for the quarter, excluding several onetime items detailed in our earnings release, was $0.02 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full-cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-K. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. We expect another ceiling test write-down in the second quarter as $90 oil prices in 2014 are replaced with significantly lower 2015 prices in the 12-month trailing average.
Our plan for 2015. Projects improving cash operating cost throughout the year. We are taking the right steps today to lower our cost structure and improve margins across the company. Our first quarter domestic lease operating expense per barrel equivalent dropped more than 15% over the prior year. Our G&A expense will benefit from our recent reorganization and headcount reductions. Excluding the onetime costs associated with these actions, we estimate that our G&A expense will fall by about 15%, or more than $40 million, in 2016 and beyond. Our interest expense will also benefit by $10 million per year due to lower rates on our recently issued senior notes. These are significant positive changes to our cost structure in future periods. As Lee mentioned in his opening remarks, the capital market transactions we executed in the first quarter were well timed, allowing us to navigate uncertain market conditions.
At the end of the first quarter, we had nothing drawn on our revolver. With about $2 billion of liquidity, our capital structure is the best it has been in more than a decade. The focus this year will remain profitable growth, continued cost structure improvement, getting the STACK HBP-ed and ready to deliver strong future growth as we prepare for full field development and maintaining balance sheet integrity.
I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our Anadarko Basin."

I'd like to spend the remainder of today's call on the Anadarko Basin. More specifically, share some additional information with you on why we are gaining more confidence in this play's ability to deliver corporate growth for years to come. We're on track to deliver 45% production growth from the Anadarko Basin in 2015. We expect that our first quarter average net rate, 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, will grow to an average of 57,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, and we expect to exit the year at more than 68,000 BOE per day. The slight drop in our first quarter daily average is simply related to the timing of pad completions and plant shut-ins for offsetting completions. Be assured, we're on track to deliver our growth projections in 2015.
While excited about this growth, we're even more excited about our increasing rates of return, the improving productivity of our wells and the data we were obtaining from a large number of STACK wells that have now been online for 2 years or more.
Let me provide a few distinct examples to help you better understand our excitement and growing confidence levels in the value of STACK. Our well results continue to get better.
On Slide 7 in the @FX publication, we included 6 STACK wells, that on average, have higher 30-, 60- and 90-day production rates than our 2014 wells at more than 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the 30- and 60-day average rates and 765 barrels of oil equivalent per day for our average 90-day rate. The oil percentage on a well-head basis was about 80% over the first 30 days and averaged 74% oil over the first 90 days. The wells validate our type-curve increase at year-end 2014. These wells were drilled across 3 separate townships, and we continue to see very consistent and repeatable results as we work to HBP our acreage. When you average the 30 STACK wells we have released over the last 2 years, the 30-day average oil percentage is greater than 80%. Again, this is an oil play, and our acreage was purposely assembled in the up-dip portion of the play in what we call the oil window. This is the area that we targeted, and we're really proud to own it today.
As you move south and west towards the traditional Cana play, one would expect the gas cuts to become materially higher. We have about 100 wells planned for the Anadarko Basin in 2015, where we're gathering data very quickly. There are an additional 15 operated wells in the basin that have recently commenced production or are in various stages of completion. We look forward to sharing more long-term production history with you around midyear.
Let me comment on our initiatives that have come up in a few of our investor meetings and discussions. Gas-to-oil ratio or GOR. We're seeing very high oil production in the early life of our wells, and this production is holding up extremely well in our longest-dated wells. Our oldest well was drilled 4 years ago to test the STACK concept. After 4 years, that well is still producing 62% black oil.
In addition, our first -- in addition to the first STACK test, we also had the benefit of more than 2,000 vertical wells drilled and completed over the last half-century. These wells had co-mingled production from a multitude of shallower horizons, all sourced by the Woodford formation, one of the nation's most prolific source rocks. From this large data set of legacy vertical producers, we took a representative sample across our acreage position and examined the GOR over time. Although the oil volumes from these vertical wells weren't impressive by today's standards, what was impressive was the consistency of the GOR over the life of the wells.
On Slide 8, in @NFX, we shared our original 6-well sample with you. We used this information to create our type-curve assumptions. To date, our 4 oldest wells, which now have at least 2 years of production history, have performed in line with our forecast GOR. The GOR is remarkably consistent with our sample of legacy vertical wells and with our early type-curve assumptions in STACK. Our model GOR assumptions appear to be very sound.
Recall that our economic assumptions for the STACK play assume an average oil yield of about 40% over the life of the well. That's a 3-stream production, representing 40% oil, 30% NGLs, that'd be 70% total liquids over the life of the well; the balance being 30% natural gas.
We know that the GOR will increase over time, and we feel that our forecasts are in line with our expectations and performance observed to date. We believe that Newfield controls the best acreage in the play. And as you move west, again, we expect the play to ultimately transition to dry gas. Our original lease capture was focused on the oil window.
So make no mistake. The plays on our STACK acreage are oil plays. Slide 9 shows that the initial oil cumes in STACK are very high. Over the first 5 years, we estimate we will produce about 60% of the total recoverable oil and nearly 80% in the first 10 years. The high initial oil rates in the early life of these wells materially enhance our returns, even at the budgeted $60 3-year average oil outlook.
Slide 10 shows the first-year economics of the STACK well computed on a 3-stream basis. Our production is reported as well-head production or 2-stream: oil and natural gas. But it's important that you understand the economic uplift created by 3-stream processing. Operating teams in the Anadarko Basin are doing a fantastic job today, and we are leading the industry. The initial learnings from our SCOOP development have been rapidly applied to STACK. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for about $8.5 million gross, already in line with our full year average forecast. Our well costs are down nearly 50% on a cost-per-lateral-foot basis over the last 3 years, and we're excited about where we may be by year-end 2015.
The real prize lies in development mode, where we are certain that significant savings can be realized. There's no better comparison than Williston, which is now in full development. Our 10,000-foot lateral wells in the Williston are today being drilled in just 15 days from common pad locations for an industry-leading low cost of less than $6 million, including facility cost.
My final point today relates to the significant resource potential in stacking development horizons -- in development wells in multiple horizons across our acreage. The STACK play has more than 700 feet of oil-saturated column in the Woodford and Meramec shales. Our confidence in well performance was demonstrated at year-end, when we increased our STACK type curve by 20% to our current estimate of 950,000 barrels. To date, we have completed 4 spacing tests in STACK, all with very encouraging early results.
As illustrated on Slide 11 in @NFX, we now have tests in the Woodford-Woodford, Meramec-Meramec and Woodford-Meramec, as tight as a 880 feet apart horizontally and 175 feet apart vertically. Although it's way too early for definitive conclusions, the average for these 8 wells has performed in line with our 950,000 BOE type curve, and 3 additional operated spacing tests are planned for later this year.
We kept our remarks brief this morning to leave ample time for your questions. I will close simply by saying Newfield has high-quality options in SCOOP and STACK today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we position the company to compete and win in today's environment and accelerate development in the future.
To date, we have delivered outstanding operating results, and we intend to deliver on our full year objectives.
Thanks for your investment in our company. We look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

I think you've got 3 or 4 questions in too, so I complement you on that as well. I'll try to cover them all. So first one on $8.5 million. We're super pleased to be at $8.5 million at the end of the first quarter. When you think about the forecast that we put forth at the beginning of the year, we were thinking $8.5 million would be a good average outcome for the year. So I would tell you that we're ahead of schedule. Of the savings that had been realized to date to get to that $8.5 million, it's split about half service cost and half efficiency gains. So the part we really like is the efficiency gain side of the equation, because that's the piece that we get to hold on to when market conditions turn and commodity prices rise again. So ahead of expectations year-to-date. I indicated we think that we'll have additional gains as the year unfolds. We also have the benefit of -- we had a lot of carryover activity into the quarter, that would be included in those costs. And we hope to see a better run rate as we approach midyear. So look forward to us giving you an update midyear, and we'll give you some clarity on what we think the balance of the year is going to be. As far as the STACK play, the Meramec sections, depending on where you're at, let's say, it's 300 to 500 feet thick. Generally, the Woodford section's 150, 200 feet thick. We talked about it as being a 700-foot thick oil-saturated section. When we acquired the acreage position, we set out to buy it. We didn't buy edges. So as you move away from our acreage position, north, south and east, you do approach edges. But we don't have material edges, if you will, from a conventional standpoint within our acreage footprint, so that's positive. I think that's one of the contributors to the consistent results that we're seeing across the acreage block. And I would bet in the end of the day that we'll develop horizons that will be somewhere between 100- to 200-foot thick target intervals. And with regard to targeting within the section, we've not worked out all of the details yet in terms of specific windows. But clearly, the team's got the ability to land in 10- to 20-foot horizons and stay there over the 10,000-foot lateral. But generally, how you want to think about it is how many layers can we develop in the 700-foot section? We've got to drill additional spacing tests to get more definitive data there to give you an answer on that."

We know where we want to be in that regard, and we're going to continue to stay focused on that. As for deals, we continue to look. But I'd tell you, given the slight rise in the commodity prices, I think that in today's world, many of the sellers have what we believe are very unrealistic expectations. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that maybe even sky-high expectations. So in that regard, we'll stay in the game. But Newfield's not going to make an investment that doesn't make sense."

To really understand what's going on in SCOOP, the summary of it is it's just a function that we have more oil and less gas. And therefore on a BOE basis, it's translating to what appears to be a lower number. If you wanted a little bit more granularity on that, when you actually look at the oil phase that we're pursuing out there, we really only drilled 1 well there. And that particular well, it was a slightly longer well, but it was one of the furthest east wells we've drilled. And as we moved east in the play, we pick up a higher oil percentage. In this case, we actually had a 61% oil cut versus the prior year had about 50% or so. When you move into the wet gas, last year, we had a considerable number of wells that were redrilled, and those wells produced at about 26% oil cut. This year, the wells that we drilled, the 5 that we reported, were at 30% oil cut. And that's really a function of choke management. What the teams have developed, and we've been talking about this for quite a while, reducing our drawdowns and holding these wells back a little bit earlier on. And we're finding, one, that some of the additional benefits, not only in increasing our EUR, is the fact we're actually getting a higher liquids cut in the separator as a result of that. So really compliment them for continuing to look at their operating practices, and it's really going to get translated to the bottom line."

We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon along with our 10-K. By now, I hope you've read through the information, which included our fourth quarter earnings and operations results, our year-end 2014 proved reserves, our 2015 capital budget along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year and a detailed @NFX publication which includes lots of new information on our results to date and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.
Since late last year, we have been laser focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 are very clear. 
First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. But we've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year and focused our dollars on our highest return area, the Anadarko Basin.
Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We've worked to production delineate more than 300 square miles, and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent, and we are delivering 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.
Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin, which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin, and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is a leader in the area, and we are building scale in a region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.
And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long-term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.
Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. In 2014, we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index, and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group. 
The Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig rates and service costs reset to align with a new and lower near-term oil price outlook. The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the plays' potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come. We push well costs lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. 
In today's @NFX publication, you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK wells on a per foot basis for about half what we drilled and completed these wells for in 2012. In today's @NFX, you will see that our recent well results are outstanding. We are seeing significantly lower well cost, and we increased our STACK-type curve by 20%, or about 150,000 barrels from the 800,000 barrel figure to a 950,000 barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage. 
Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year, and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics. 
Across the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year-end proved reserves adjusted for asset sales. This translates to an R/P of greater than 250%. And those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel, and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.
At year-end 2014, our proved reserves were 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. And keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in nonstrategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.
Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.
We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. Our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets, and in late 2014 brought our Pearl field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015. Pearl is now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from 3 wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.
As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014, improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage, going into 2015. 
And lastly, we advanced the elimination of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory. Among the many STACK plays in the Uinta Basin, we saw some very encouraging flow rates from the Wasatch and Uteland Butte. And today, we disclosed our first well from a new play called the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts in the STACK geologic horizons in the Anadarko Basin and in the Uinta, but will be tested on the road ahead.
Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our most recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our domestic business. We lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million or about $0.38 per share on revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million. 
So now to the 2015 outlook. Although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically, however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer, mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company to once again focus on higher growth when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels. 
The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production, and we can defer development without losing opportunities. The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large, high-quality asset that can deliver solid returns even at today's commodity prices.
We moved decisively in early 2014 and strengthened our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart with a current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015 and around $350 million in 2016.
Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. Our 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long-term rig or service contracts outside of the Anadarko Basin. Today, we are working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align costs with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today, and we are focused on materially reducing these costs across our operating regions. 
Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We have high graded our investments into the Anadarko Basin, and new are taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses. Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We have seen drilling and completions costs reduced by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date, and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year-end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year-to-date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full year G&A. We have vigorous new initiatives underway across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment. Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth.
Our 2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10% adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32% including China and 18% domestically. Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter '14 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack, and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections. 
As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our nonoperating drilling activity is expected to remain high during the course of the year. 
Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We are drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015. That's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year, and we are not yet in development mode.
We are drilling wells cheaper, and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well costs for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well costs have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.
Drilling to date has production delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. 
We recently increased EURs for our STACK-type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and costs average 30% to 40%. As service cost continue to drop, our returns should further improve. We show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX publication.
In less than 4 years, we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. We expect that our Anadarko Basin program will grow more than 40% in 2015, and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day. The high grading of our 2015 investments required near-term reductions in activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. 
Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014 and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from 4 rigs in 2014 to 1 rig in 2015. Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP, and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service costs align. 
The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta Basin, where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity. Our Greater Monument Butte Unit is a conventional waterflood characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near-term focus is on reducing our field level operating costs and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the Central Basin region of the Uinta, and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX. You will see that these wells have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well costs, and we achieved some significant advancements in 2014.
Progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth with the basin growing about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning of year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production, and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.
Salt Lake City area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf, and we affirm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. The maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were to elect to limit our future drilling, the annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. 
Today, we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates of return at the corporate level.
Uinta Basin is a very large oil resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower costs, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work in tandem, and we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future. 
As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. Newfield has high quality options today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. Newfield delivered outstanding operating results in 2014, and we continued a streak of solid execution across our company. Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are: to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue to improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find innovative ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio. 
Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts a deep inventory locations that are held by production and will be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound and will ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.

With regard to infills and density pilots, our team has continued to work, focused on HBP to drill wells, straddling lease lines. We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play, and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and the returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on. I'm excited about getting to that development phase, but we've got plenty of experience in multiple plays today with regard to spacing, so I think we've got a pretty good idea what that plan will look like forward.

But you'll see that we have drilled wells where they overlay one another and we've drilled wells that are outside of the Woodford and only in the Meramec. So you can get some feel for that, looking at the distribution of wells that have been drilled. As if you put a tape down and say, what's 300 square miles look like? It'll cover most of that area up there. And I think the split out on the wells to date, just to give you a feel, so it's not skewed. We've got about 40% of the wells that have been drilled.

We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon along with our 10-K. By now, I hope you've read through the information, which included our fourth quarter earnings and operations results, our year-end 2014 proved reserves, our 2015 capital budget along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year and a detailed @NFX publication which includes lots of new information on our results to date and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.
Since late last year, we have been laser focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 are very clear. 
First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. But we've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year and focused our dollars on our highest return area, the Anadarko Basin.
Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We've worked to production delineate more than 300 square miles, and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent, and we are delivering 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.
Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin, which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin, and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is a leader in the area, and we are building scale in a region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.
And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long-term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.
Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. In 2014, we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index, and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group. 
The Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig rates and service costs reset to align with a new and lower near-term oil price outlook. The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the plays' potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come. We push well costs lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. 
In today's @NFX publication, you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK wells on a per foot basis for about half what we drilled and completed these wells for in 2012. In today's @NFX, you will see that our recent well results are outstanding. We are seeing significantly lower well cost, and we increased our STACK-type curve by 20%, or about 150,000 barrels from the 800,000 barrel figure to a 950,000 barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage. 
Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year, and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics. 
Across the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year-end proved reserves adjusted for asset sales. This translates to an R/P of greater than 250%. And those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel, and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.
At year-end 2014, our proved reserves were 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. And keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in nonstrategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.
Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.
We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. Our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets, and in late 2014 brought our Pearl field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015. Pearl is now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from 3 wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.
As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014, improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage, going into 2015. 
And lastly, we advanced the elimination of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory. Among the many STACK plays in the Uinta Basin, we saw some very encouraging flow rates from the Wasatch and Uteland Butte. And today, we disclosed our first well from a new play called the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts in the STACK geologic horizons in the Anadarko Basin and in the Uinta, but will be tested on the road ahead.
Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our most recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our domestic business. We lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million or about $0.38 per share on revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million. 
So now to the 2015 outlook. Although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically, however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer, mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company to once again focus on higher growth when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels. 
The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production, and we can defer development without losing opportunities. The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large, high-quality asset that can deliver solid returns even at today's commodity prices.
We moved decisively in early 2014 and strengthened our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart with a current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015 and around $350 million in 2016.
Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. Our 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long-term rig or service contracts outside of the Anadarko Basin. Today, we are working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align costs with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today, and we are focused on materially reducing these costs across our operating regions. 
Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We have high graded our investments into the Anadarko Basin, and we are taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses. Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We have seen drilling and completions costs reduced by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date, and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year-end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year-to-date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full year G&A. We have vigorous new initiatives underway across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment. Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth.
Our 2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent. This equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10% adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32% including China and 18% domestically. Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter '14 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack, and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections. 
As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our nonoperating drilling activity is expected to remain high during the course of the year. 
Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We are drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015. That's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year, and we are not yet in development mode.
We are drilling wells cheaper, and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well costs for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well costs have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.
Drilling to date has production delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. 
We recently increased EURs for our STACK-type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and costs average 30% to 40%. As service cost continue to drop, our returns should further improve. We show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX publication.
In less than 4 years, we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. We expect that our Anadarko Basin program will grow more than 40% in 2015, and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day. The high grading of our 2015 investments required near-term reductions in activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. 
Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014 and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from 4 rigs in 2014 to 1 rig in 2015. Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP, and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service costs align. 
The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta Basin, where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity. Our Greater Monument Butte Unit is a conventional waterflood characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near-term focus is on reducing our field level operating costs and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the Central Basin region of the Uinta, and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX. You will see that these wells have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well costs, and we achieved some significant advancements in 2014.
Progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth with the basin growing about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning of year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production, and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.
Salt Lake City area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf, and we affirm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. The maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were to elect to limit our future drilling, the annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. 
Today, we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates of return at the corporate level.
Uinta Basin is a very large oil resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower costs, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work in tandem, and we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future. 
As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. Newfield has high quality options today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. Newfield delivered outstanding operating results in 2014, and we continued a streak of solid execution across our company. Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are: to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue to improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find innovative ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio. 
Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts a deep inventory locations that are held by production and will be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound and will ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.

Our team has worked incredibly hard to reposition the company and this is not the result of waking up one morning and having good things happen. It's a lot of good hard work by a talented team that I'm fortunate to work with and lead, so thank you for your comments. With regard to infills and density pilots, our team has continued to work, focused on HBP to drill wells, straddling lease lines. We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play, and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and the returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on. I'm excited about getting to that development phase, but we've got plenty of experience in multiple plays today with regard to spacing, so I think we've got a pretty good idea what that plan will look like forward. But we'll continue to work it in with regard to HBP-ing the acreage and over the course of this year and moving into next year, we'll keep you guys apprised of the results. But I think you can look at that map on @NFX and you can see the distribution of wells. I think the team delivered exactly what we told you we were going to do in 2014. And again, our confidence level is very, very high in those plays today."

Clearly, as we continue to generate results and hopefully prices improve, we'll get to a point where we generate incremental cash flow, but we're not going to move away from that balance. I mean we've been chasing balance now for the last 3 years. The market conditions have forced balance. We'll work our way forward in a very prudent manner. Higher prices, higher cash flow, we've got plenty of high return opportunities to invest in, will translate to more activity. Conversely, if we settled into a lower price environment for longer, I think I said earlier that we can navigate several years into the future and await that day when better returns come. Now I'm hoping for the earlier return to a more buoyant oil price, but we're covering the bases and doing the right thing today for tomorrow."

The first part, as far as how much do we need to see to have confidence in the forecast. I'll remind you and I think it's in the @NFX, the first year of drilling out here was late 2011. So we've got developing multi-year production forecasts. We've had really, really strong performance across that period in terms of the actual results versus modeled performance. That would be reservoir simulated model performance. We're upgrading the type curve in today's release, or yesterday's release and today's call, by about 20%. That's a combination of targeting, locating within the section. It's a 700-foot thick overall section and STACK. Top is about 400 or 500 feet is the Meramec and the bottom portion is Woodford. We now have wells throughout that interval. And when you look at the map that's in @NFX, I think you'll be able to conclude that we're delivering good strong results across the horizon and in both intervals. So frankly, as long as the statistical data says that the wells drilled in the play are more alike than different, we'll probably keep it that way. Because it doesn't make any sense for us to have 15 different plays to try to talk to you guys about. We're giving you a type curve that we think represents the play, and I think the results delivered demonstrate that we're doing a good job predicting performance. I expect it'll only get better from here."

We're showing strong results today across the company's portfolio. You'll see in today's @NFX that we met or exceeded our expectations across all of our operating regions. Although the focus today is on the Anadarko Basin, Team Newfield is doing extremely well. We have markedly lower well cost in the Anadarko and Williston Basin, and we expanded the track record of exceeding production expectations in the Eagle Ford, Williston and Uinta Basins. 
Our teams are looking for innovative ways to lower operating expenses and enhance margins across the business, and our efforts are flowing through our bottom line. We are confident that we have the people and assets in place today to merge stronger more profitable once commodity prices stabilize. Make no doubt about it, these are challenging and volatile times in the E&P business. 
After about 5 years of oil prices in the 90s, coming where today, coming we have oil prices in the 50s and implications of a lower for longer price scenario. We are proactively making strategic decisions to manage our business through today's cycle. The business plan differentiates Newfield today as we focus on 2 primary issues. First, ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong and that we have ample liquidity in place to build shareholder value during today's oil price environment, and to emerge stronger when prices recover. Our hedges provide certainty in our cash flows through early 2017. 
Second, we are high-grading our investments. Today, nearly all of our activity is in the Anadarko Basin. There's a healthy tension between our desire to build inventory in the Anadarko Basin and accelerate STACK development and the need to protect liquidity. Today, we increased our capital budget to $1.4 billion, up $200 million, increase relates to adding about 20,000 net acres to expand our positions in the Anadarko Basin. Our decision to accelerate drilling to hold our acreage and move into full field development. Anadarko Basin is economically resilient and our returns are improving. Our drilling additional 15 wells in 2015, we will offset about $40 million in lease renewal expenses and ensure that 100% of our acreage is HBP by the end of next year.
We believe that our business plan carefully balances these important issues. Financial transactions were executed earlier this year to strengthen our balance sheet and ensure that we have ample liquidity to not only weather a prolonged period of lower oil prices, but also to succeed and and value. 
We will maintain a strong balance sheet. We are focused on maintaining our leverage ratios at or near current levels and we would look to sell other noncore assets as required to preserve our strong balance sheet and liquidity.
Exactly 1 year ago today, we were growing more concerned about the trajectory of oil prices and moved aggressively to strengthen our hedge position. Our peers were founded and our hedges have been instrumental in preserving our cash flow. On mark-to-market at the end of July, our hedge position would add about $490 million in revenue in 2015, and an additional $250 million in 2016. This gives us higher certainty in our future cash flow and we view our hedges as a differentiator amongst our peers.
The corporate development team and the strategic planning teams has done an excellent job of mitigating risk in putting our company in a position of relative strength, and I applaud their efforts.
Over the last 5 years, we took dramatic steps to better focus our portfolio in capital investments. Before the oil price decline last year, we had executed about $2.5 billion in nonstrategic asset sales, and used a large portion of the proceeds to capture and accelerate the development of SCOOP and STACK, and this has paid off. We will continue to consider using sale of additional nonstrategic assets to fund our future acceleration plans.
In early 2015, we quickly cut our capital expenditures to borrow more than 70% of our planned investments in the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have an asset today that warrants investment and provides strong returns in today's oil prices. We clearly see today that our returns in Anadarko Basin continuing to improve.
Even with the backdrop of lower oil prices, we believe it makes sense to further consolidate into 1 of industry's best plays and use our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin. Competition for acreage in the STACK region has increased in the face of better drilling results. We are successfully adding late stage leasehold and extensional acreage today. 
With the disconnect between buyer and seller expectations for acquisition opportunities in the region, we view acreage additions as a better value proposition to exploit our distinct operating advantage. Perhaps the drop in oil prices and the realization of oil prices could stay lower for longer will create more reasonable acquisition opportunities for us in the future.
Before we go into the second quarter details, let me quickly summarize what I believe were the key takeaways in today's operations update.
Number one, our well results in STACK are improving. In today's @NFX, we share with you results from an additional 17 STACK wells and continued strong performance from our SCOOP development drilling. To date, we have drilled and completed 46 operated SXL wells in STACK. Two, the rapidly productions delineating our STACK acreage as we push to get it held by production. Wells we have drilled to date are geographically dispersed and we continue to push rigs towards the edges as we align drilling plans with lease requirements. We're encouraged by the consistent and commercial results we are realizing across the acreage.
The acceleration of the STACK allows us to minimize lease renewal cost through higher value drilling investments. The rigs we've added are on a well to well basis, and we have the ability to quickly slow investments if oil prices were to deteriorate our cash flow outlook.
And three, our STACK wells are oil wells. We build our position in STACK in the oil window, and our wells are averaging about 80% black oil in the first 30 days of production. To date, average black oil volumes from our 46 wells are outperforming our tight curve assumptions. 
Slide 11 in at @NFX depicts this outperformance, and supports why our confidence is continuing to grow. Later in our remarks, we'll better explain how the play transitions from wet gas to black oil across the play fairway.
Before, we're testing multiple geologic horizons and this will be a STACK development play. To date, we have successfully tested the Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford are other perspective zones that we plan to test in the coming months. To date, about 70% of our STACK wells have been drilled and completed in the Meramec Shale.
We're rapidly lowering our well cost in the Anadarko Basin, this is particularly impressive in STACK, but we are not yet in full field development. Recent wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days, and our recent wells are averaging about $7.9 million including facilities. We hope to keep a good portion of these savings even in a rising oil price environment. 
Our well cost today are down about $600,000 from our first quarter update. We know that in development mode, we will easily shave another $1 million or more off the completed well cost. By now, as you simply look at what our team is delivering today in the Williston Basin.
And lastly, we're accelerating activity and the timing to full field development. By year-end, about 60% of our acreage in STACK will be held by production and all of our acreage will be HBP by the end of next year. With this increased activity, we now expect that our fourth quarter production from the Anadarko Basin will average about 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net and we expect to deliver strong and economic growth from SCOOP and STACK in 2016. You'll hear more on this topics when Gary provides our operational update a little later. 
I'll now turn the call over to Larry Massaro to summarize our second quarter financial results. Larry?"

Financially, the second quarter was very solid. We're seeing the combined benefits of lower service costs, learning curve improvements and efficiency gains and our own efforts to reduce expenses and improve margins across the business.
Year-to-date, we've invested about $730 million, excluding capitalized interest and internal costs. We expected our investments from the second half of the year will approximate the first half, including about $400 million in the third quarter and $275 million in the fourth quarter. Our capital investment budget for the year is $1.4 billion, up $200 million. The increase is attributable to 20,000 acres in Anadarko Basin, increased drilling activity and faster drilling times.
In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution of strong well performance. Our domestic production in the second quarter came in at the upper end of our guidance, despite losing about 200,000 barrels equivalent related to weather and our midstream provider's curtailment in SCOOP.
Total production in the second quarter was 14.1 million barrels equivalent, of which 51% was oil and 65% was liquids. Our domestic production grew about 7% quarter-over-quarter to 12.4 million barrels equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth to 13%. More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 22% year-over-year.
This trend in our production year-to-date has allowed us to raise our full year guidance to 53.5 million to 55 million barrels equivalent. With all the increase attribute to our domestic operations. 
Our domestic production is now expected to be 48.5 million to 50 million barrels equivalent. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $347 million or $2.14 per share, topping consensus estimates.
Adjusted net income for the quarter excluding several one-time items detailed in our earnings release was $0.46 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility for our debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full cost accounting and significantly lower commodity price in a 12-month trailing average. 
We have taken both prompt and significant steps to improve our cost structure across the company. In the second quarter, our reoccurring lease operating expenses was well below guidance at $4.60 per BOE. Second quarter LOE was lower than our full year run rate due to the timing of expected expenditures. We again lowered our full year LOE expectation of $5.20 per BOE.
As we noted last quarter, our recent restructuring and headcount reductions will reduce future G&A expense by $40 million a year, and our annual interest expense will drop by about $10 million a year due to lower interest rates associated with our debt refinancing earlier this year.
As we referenced, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. As we seek to leverage our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin and our desire to transition to full field development in STACK later next year, we know we must tailor our investment levels to the oil price environment and our cash flow expectations. 
If oil prices stay in a sub-$50 per barrel range, we will likely reduce our 2016 expenditures to maintenance move levels. We estimate that we could maintain our domestic production levels for about $1 billion. Should prices strengthened to $55 to $60 per barrel, we are capable of strong domestic production growth. Supported by improving rates of return with a capital budget similar to 2015 investment levels. Newfield clearly has high-quality options today.
At the end of the second quarter, there was nothing drawn on our revolver and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We are fortunate to be well hedged with cash flow significantly protected into 2017. 
I'll turn the call over to Gary Packer for the operations update."

As you know, we're only allocating drilling capital to 2 areas today: the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. But let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK. In addition to STAC",960,"Thanks, Larry. As you know, we're only allocating drilling capital to 2 areas today: the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. But let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK. In addition to STACK, we continue to see great results from our SCOOP in Springer plays, and look forward to testing other potential geological horizon in the basin over time. 
During the second quarter, we brought online 14 new SCOOP oil wells, including our first SXL well in the Springer Shale. We continue to see good results in the development where we are running 5 rigs today.
Our overall program shifted more heavily to STACK and SCOOP oil, and the results are evident through our high oil cuts. We have 8 rigs running in STACK today. One of our most encouraging data points in today's update relates to our consistency in the STACK wells. 
On Slide 7 in @NFX, we provide 30-day average production rates for 17 new wells stretched across the acreage, which covers more than 300 square miles. We now have 46 SXL wells, of which 32 have been completed in the Meramec Shale.
We are confident that a significant portion of our acreage will be developed with STACK wells in both the Meramec and Woodford. We've drilled 5 pseudo-pilots today to test horizontal and vertical well space, some of which were online for more than 1 year now.
Although early, these pilots are providing encouraging results. Please reference the geologic illustration on Slide 12 in @NFX. To date, we have successfully tested multiple wells in Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. We have more than 700 foot of saturated interval across the large portion of our acreage and we have taken whole course towards the acreage to better understand reservoir quality and reservoir thickness. As expected, our STACK results continued to improve, reflecting the rapid advancements we are making in our drilling and completion operations. Our most recent wells have higher 30 and 60-day rates, not all the wells have 90-day production rates yet. In a wellhead basis, oil percentage from these wells average nearly 80% over the first 30 days. We are not surprised by these high oil cuts. In fact, we intentionally capture the oil window in our initial leasing concept. 
Slide 9 is important to understand as you move from the dry gas Cana Field to the north and east across our acreage, the play transitions from a wet gas to a black oil. Note that the 30-day average oil cuts across the acreage. In addition to our first Meramec well, drilled some 4 years ago now, we also had production data for more than 3,000 vertical wells drilled over the last 50 years. These wells comingle production from a multiple horizontals, all sourced by the Woodford. GOR, or gas-oil ratios, we are seeing today are very consistent with historical production data. Our predrill reservoir modeling and our tight curbs. These are well results from our North STACK acreage help validate our encouragement and our GOR assumptions appear to be very sound.
In the first quarter, we introduced Slide 11, which originally just showed our expected oil accums over the first decade of production. Today, we enhanced disclosure by providing you with the actual production through the 46 SXL wells we have drilled to date. You can see that the wells are highly correlative to our type curve. Furthermore, we today provided actual accums on 21 Meramec wells with tighter frac cluster spacing. Some of these wells have now been online for nearly 1 year. Tighter frac cluster spacing is generating significantly higher oil production has now become our norm. We continue to optimize our completion designs. You can see we are making great strides.
Based on our 950,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve and today's lower cost, our wells are expected to pay out in just 2 years. Our returns are being enhanced by higher oil production early and the significant reductions we're making in well cost. 
These slides, 14 and 15, in @NFX, it's important to understand that more than half of the cost savings we have seen to date are related to efficiencies as demonstrated by reduction in days versus depth, and not simply lower service costs.
Our most recent drill in complete cost in STACK of $7.9 million, down $600,000 from our first quarter average. We frequently participate in wells operated by others and from this data, we know that we're clearly leading the industry in drilling days and cost. Our days to depth are our more recent operated wells have been drilled in as few as 12 base.
The real prize lies in development mode, where we are certain that we will achieve at least another $1 million savings in our completed well cost and our teams are pushing to get us there as soon as possible.
As for other active development plays, let me close with a quick update on the Williston Basin. Our team continues to find innovative ways to improve our margins with faster drilling times, improve efficiencies and optimize completions. Recent SXL wells in the Williston Basin have been drilled in about 14 days, and for an all-in cost with facilities of about $5.5 million. Newfield has a long and proven history of driving learning curves and improving returns in full field development. The Williston is a great example. The -- you can review recent history and see the same trends in the Eagle Ford, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and the SCOOP. Williston is a great proxy for where we will ultimately be heading in our STACK development.
I'll now turn the call back to Lee for closing remarks."

Newfield is showing strong results today across the company's portfolio. You'll see in today's @NFX that we met or exceeded our expectations across all of our operating regions. Although the focus today is on the Anadarko Basin, team Newfield [indiscernible] doing extremely well. We have markedly lowered well costs in the Anadarko and Williston Basins, and we extended the track record of exceeding production expectations in the Eagle Ford, Williston and Uinta Basins.
Our teams are looking for innovative ways to lower operating expenses and enhance margins across the business, and our efforts are flowing through our bottom line. I'm confident we have the people and assets in place today to emerge stronger and more profitable once commodity prices stabilize. But make no doubt about it, these are challenging and volatile times in the E&P business.
After about 5 years of oil prices in the 90s, we're today coming to grips with oil prices in the 50s and implications of a lower prolonged price scenario. We are proactively making strategic decisions to manage our business through today's cycle.
Our business plan differentiates Newfield today as we focused on 2 primary issues: first, ensuring that our balance sheet remained strong and that we have ample liquidity in place to build shareholder value during today's oil price environment; and to emerge stronger when prices recover. Our hedges provide certainty in our cash flows through early 2017.
Second, we are high-grading our investments. Today, nearly all of our activity is in the Anadarko Basin. There is a healthy tension between our desire to build inventory in the Anadarko Basin and accelerate STACK development and the need to protect liquidity. And today, we increased our capital budget to $1.4 billion, up $200 million. The increase relates to adding about 20,000 net acres to expand our positions in the Anadarko Basin, our decision to accelerate drilling to hold our acreage and move into full field development. Anadarko Basin is economically resilient, and our returns are improving.
By drilling an additional 15 wells in 2015, we will offset about $40 million in lease renewal expenses and ensure that 100% of our acreage is HBP by the end of next year. We believe that our business plan carefully balances these important issues.
The financial transactions we executed earlier this year strengthened our balance sheet and ensured that we have ample liquidity to not only weather a prolonged period of lower oil prices, but also to succeed and add value. We will maintain a strong balance sheet. We are focused on maintaining our leverage ratios at or near current levels, and we would look to sell other noncore assets as required to preserve our strong balance sheet and liquidity.
Exactly 1 year ago today, we were growing more concerned about the trajectory of oil prices and moved aggressively to strengthen our hedge position. Our fears were unfounded, and our hedges have been instrumental in preserving our cash flow. On mark-to-market at the end of July, our hedge position would add about $490 million in revenue in 2015 and an additional $250 million in 2016. This gives us higher certainty in our future cash flow, and we view our hedges as a differentiator amongst our peers.
Our corporate development team and the strategic planning teams have done an excellent job of mitigating risk and putting our company in a position of relative strength, and I applaud their efforts.
Over the last 5 years, we took dramatic steps to better focus our portfolio in capital investments. Before the oil price declined last year, we had executed about $2.5 billion in nonstrategic asset sales and used a large portion of the proceeds to capture and accelerate the development of SCOOP and STACK, and this has paid off. We will continue to consider using sale of additional nonstrategic assets to fund our future acceleration plans.
In early 2015, we quickly cut our capital expenditures to funneled [ph] more than 70% of our planned investments going to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have an asset today that warrants investment and provides strong returns at today's oil prices. You'll clearly see today that our returns in Anadarko Basin continues to improve.
Even with the backdrop of low oil prices, we believe it makes sense to further consolidate into one of the industry's best plays and use our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin. Competition for acreage in the STACK region has increased in the face of better drilling results. We are successfully adding late-stage leasehold and extensional acreage today.
With the disconnect between buyer and seller expectations for acquisition opportunities in the region, we view acreage additions as a better value proposition to exploit our distinct operating advantage. Perhaps the drop in oil prices and the realization that oil prices could stay lower for longer will create more reasonable acquisition opportunities for us in the future.
Before we go into the second quarter details, let me quickly summarize what I believe were the key takeaways in today's operations update.
Number one, our well results in STACK are improving. In today's @NFX, we share with you results from an additional 17 STACK wells and continued strong performance from our SCOOP development drilling. To date, we have drilled and completed 46 operated SXL wells in STACK. Number two, we are rapidly production-delineating our STACK acreage as we push to get it held by production. The wells we have drilled to date are geographically dispersed, and we continue to push rigs towards the edges as we align drilling plans with lease requirements. We're encouraged by the consistent and commercial results we are realizing across the acreage.
The acceleration in STACK allows us to minimize lease renewal cost through higher value drilling investments. The rigs we've added are on a well-to-well basis, and we have the ability to quickly slow investments if oil prices were to deteriorate our cash flow outlook.
Number three, our STACK wells are oil wells. We build our position in STACK in the oil window, and our wells are averaging about 80% black oil in the first 30 days of production. To date, average black oil volumes from our 46 wells are outperforming our tight curve assumptions.
Slide 11 in @NFX depicts this outperformance and supports why our confidence is continuing to grow. Later in our remarks, we'll better explain how the play transitions from wet gas to black oil across the play fairway.
Before, we're testing multiple geologic horizons, and this will be a STACK development play. To date, we have successfully tested the Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. There are other prospective zones that we plan to test in the coming months. To date, about 70% of our STACK wells have been drilled and completed in the Meramec Shale.
We're rapidly lowering our well cost in the Anadarko Basin. This is particularly impressive in STACK, but we are not yet in full field development. Recent wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days, and our recent wells are averaging about $7.9 million including facilities. We hope to keep a good portion of these savings even in a rising oil price environment.
Our well costs today are down about $600,000 from our first quarter update. And we know that in development mode, we will easily shave another $1 million or more off the completed well cost. By now, as you simply look at what our team is building today in the Williston Basin.
And lastly, we're accelerating activity and the timing to full field development. By year-end, about 60% of our acreage in STACK will be held by production, and all of our acreage will be HBP by the end of next year. With this increased activity, we now expect that our fourth quarter production from the Anadarko Basin will average about 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, and we expect to deliver strong and economic growth from SCOOP and STACK in 2016. You'll hear more on these topics when Gary provides our operational update a little later.
I'll now turn the call over to Larry Massaro to summarize our second quarter financial results. Larry?"
32137,305717858,849618,"Newfield Exploration Co., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Ovintiv Exploration Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. Financially, the second quarter was very solid.

Financially, the second quarter was very solid. We're seeing the combined benefits of lower service costs, learning curve improvements and efficiency gains and our own efforts to reduce expenses and improve margins across the business.
Year-to-date, we've invested about $730 million, excluding capitalized interest and internal costs. We expected that our investments from the second half of the year will approximate to first half, including about $400 million in the third quarter and $275 million in the fourth quarter. Our capital investment budget for the year is $1.4 billion, up $200 million. The increase is attributable to the 20,000 new acres in the Anadarko Basin, increased drilling activity and faster drilling times.
In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and strong well performance. Our domestic production in the second quarter came in at the upper end of our guidance, despite losing about 200,000 barrels equivalent related to weather and our midstream provider's curtailment in SCOOP.
Total production in the second quarter was 14.1 million barrels equivalent, of which 51% was oil and 65% was liquids. Our domestic production grew about 7% quarter-over-quarter to 12.4 million barrels equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 13%. More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 22% year-over-year.
The strength in our production year-to-date has allowed us to raise our full year guidance to 53.5 million to 55 million barrels equivalent, with all the increase attributed to our domestic operations. Our domestic production is now expected to be 48.5 million to 50 million barrels equivalent.
Discretionary cash flow from operations was $347 million or $2.14 per share, topping consensus estimates.
Adjusted net income for the quarter, excluding several one-time items detailed in our earnings release, was $0.46 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full cost accounting and significantly lower commodity price in the 12-month trailing average.
We have taken both prompt and significant steps to improve our cost structure across the company. In the second quarter, our reoccurring lease operating expenses was well below guidance at $4.60 per BOE. Second quarter LOE was lower than our full year run rate due to the timing of expected expenditures. We again lowered our full year LOE expectation to $5.20 per BOE.
As we noted last quarter, our recent restructuring and headcount reductions will reduce future G&A expense by $40 million a year, and our annual interest expense would drop by about $10 million a year due to lower interest rates associated with our debt refinancing earlier this year.
As we referenced, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. As we seek to leverage our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin and our desire to transition to full field development in STACK later next year, we know we must tailor our investment levels to the oil price environment and our cash flow expectations. 
If oil prices stay in a sub-$50 per barrel range, we would likely reduce our 2016 expenditures to maintenance mode levels. We estimate that we could maintain our domestic production levels for about $1 billion. Should prices strengthen to $55 to $60 per barrel, we are capable of strong domestic production growth, supported by improving rates of return with a capital budget similar to 2015 investment levels. Newfield clearly has high-quality options today.
At the end of the second quarter, there was nothing drawn on our revolver, and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We are fortunate to be well hedged with cash flow significantly protected into 2017. 
I'll turn the call over to Gary Packer for the operations update."

As you know, we're only allocating drilling capital to 2 areas today, the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. So let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK.In addition to STAC",964,"Thanks, Larry. As you know, we're only allocating drilling capital to 2 areas today, the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. So let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK.
In addition to STACK, we continue to see great results from our SCOOP and Springer plays and look forward to testing other potential geologic horizon in the basin over time.
During the second quarter, we brought online 14 new SCOOP oil wells, including our first SXL well in the Springer Shale. We continue to see good results in the development where we are running 5 rigs today.
Our overall program shifted more heavily to STACK and SCOOP oil, and the results are evident through our high oil cuts. We have 8 rigs running in STACK today. One of our most encouraging data points in today's update relates to our consistency in the STACK wells.
On Slide 7 in @NFX, we provide 30-day average production rates for 17 new wells stretched across the acreage, which covers more than 300 square miles. We now have 46 SXL wells, of which 32 have been completed in the Meramec Shale. We are confident that a significant portion of our acreage will be developed with STACK wells in both the Meramec and the Woodford. We have drilled 5 pseudo-pilots to date to test horizontal and vertical well spacing, some of which have been online for more than 1 year now. Although early, these pilots are providing encouraging results.
Please reference the geologic illustration on Slide 12 in @NFX. To date, we have successfully tested multiple wells in Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. We have more than 700 foot of saturated interval across the large portion of our acreage, and we have taken whole course towards the acreage to better understand reservoir quality and reservoir thickness. As expected, our STACK results continue to improve, reflecting the rapid advancements we are making in our drilling and completion operations. Our most recent wells have higher 30- and 60-day rates and not all the wells have 90-day production rates yet.
On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from these wells averaged nearly 80% over the first 30 days. We are not surprised by these high oil cuts. In fact, we intentionally captured the oil window with our initial leasing concept.
Slide 9 is important to understand. As you move from the dry gas Cana Field to the north and east across our acreage, the play transitions from a wet gas to a black oil. Note the 30-day average oil cuts across the acreage.
In addition to our first Meramec well, drilled some 4 years ago now, we also had production data for more than 3,000 vertical wells drilled over the last 50 years. These wells comingle production from a multiple zones, all sourced by the Woodford.
The GOR, or gas-oil ratios, we are seeing today are very consistent with historical production data, our predrill reservoir modeling and our tight curves. Recent well results from our North STACK acreage help validate our encouragement, and our GOR assumptions appear to be very sound.
In the first quarter, we introduced Slide 11, which originally just showed our expected oil cumes over the first decade of production. Today, we enhanced disclosure by providing you with the actual production from the 46 SXL wells we have drilled to date. You can see that the wells are highly correlative to our type curve. Furthermore, we today provided actual cumes on 21 Meramec wells with tighter frac cluster spacing. Some of these wells have now been online for nearly 1 year. Tighter frac cluster spacing is generating significantly higher oil production and has now become our norm. We continue to optimize our completion designs. You can see we are making great strides.
Based on our 950,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve and today's lower cost, our wells are expected to pay out in just 2 years. Our returns are being enhanced by higher oil production early and the significant reductions we're making in well cost.
See slides 14 and 15 in @NFX. It's important to understand that more than half of the cost savings we have seen to date are related to efficiencies as demonstrated by reductions in days versus depth and not simply lower service costs.
Our most recent drill in complete cost in STACKwas  $7.9 million, down $600,000 from our first quarter average. We frequently participate in wells operated by others, and from this data, we know that we're clearly leading the industry in drilling days and cost. Our days to depth on our most recent operated wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days.
The real prize lies in development mode, where we are certain that we will achieve at least another $1 million savings in our completed well cost, and our teams are pushing to get us there as soon as possible.
As for other active development plays, let me close with a quick update on the Williston Basin. Our team continues to find innovative ways to improve our margins through faster drilling times, improved efficiencies and optimized completions. Recent SXL wells in the Williston Basin have been drilled in about 14 days and for an all-in cost with facilities of about $5.5 million.
Newfield has a long and proven history of driving learning curves and improving returns in full field development. The Williston is a great example. You can review recent history and see the same trends in the Eagle Ford, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and in SCOOP. The Williston is a great proxy for where we will ultimately be heading in our STACK development.
I'll now turn the call back to Lee for closing remarks."

So we'll continue to work through that progression.

Newfield is delivering strong results today across the company's portfolio. You'll see in today's @NFX that we met or exceeded our expectations across all of our operating regions. Although the focus today is on the Anadarko Basin, team Newfield is executing extremely well. We have markedly lowered well costs in the Anadarko and Williston Basins, and we extended the track record of exceeding production expectations in the Eagle Ford, Williston and Uinta Basins.
Our teams are looking for innovative ways to lower operating expenses and enhance margins across the business, and their efforts are flowing through our bottom line. I'm confident that we have the people and assets in place today to emerge stronger and more profitable once commodity prices stabilize. But make no doubt about it, these are challenging and volatile times in the E&P business.
After about 5 years of oil prices in the 90s, we're today coming to grips with oil prices in the 50s and implications of a lower-for-longer price scenario. We are proactively making strategic decisions to manage our business through today's cycle.
Our business plan differentiates Newfield today as we focus on 2 primary issues: first, ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong and that we have ample liquidity in place to build shareholder value during today's oil price environment; and to emerge stronger when prices recover. Our hedges provide certainty in our cash flows through early 2017.
Second, we are high-grading our investments. Today, nearly all of our activity is in the Anadarko Basin. There is a healthy tension between our desire to build inventory in the Anadarko Basin and accelerate STACK development and the need to protect liquidity. Today, we increased our capital budget to $1.4 billion, up $200 million. The increase relates to adding about 20,000 net acres to extend our positions in the Anadarko Basin, our decision to accelerate drilling to hold our acreage and move into full field development. Anadarko Basin is economically resilient, and our returns are improving.
By drilling an additional 15 wells in 2015, we will offset about $40 million in lease renewal expenses and ensure that 100% of our acreage is HBP by the end of next year. We believe that our business plan carefully balances these important issues.
Financial transactions we executed earlier this year strengthened our balance sheet and ensured that we have ample liquidity to not only weather a prolonged period of lower oil prices, but also to succeed and add value. We will maintain a strong balance sheet. We are focused on maintaining our leverage ratios at or near current levels, and we would look to sell other noncore assets as required to preserve our strong balance sheet and liquidity.
Exactly 1 year ago today, we were growing more concerned about the trajectory of oil prices and moved aggressively to strengthen our hedge position. Our fears were founded, and our hedges have been instrumental in preserving our cash flow. On mark-to-market at the end of July, our hedge position would add about $490 million in revenue in 2015 and an additional $250 million in 2016. This gives us higher certainty in our future cash flow, and we view our hedges as a differentiator amongst our peers.
Our corporate development team and strategic planning teams have done an excellent job of mitigating risk and putting our company in a position of relative strength, and I applaud their efforts.
Over the last 5 years, we took dramatic steps to better focus our portfolio in capital investments. Before the oil price decline last year, we had executed about $2.5 billion in nonstrategic asset sales and used a large portion of the proceeds to capture and accelerate the development of SCOOP and STACK, and this has paid off. We will continue to consider using sale of additional nonstrategic assets to fund our future acceleration plans.
In early 2015, we quickly cut our capital expenditures and funneled more than 70% of our planned investments into the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have an asset today that warrants investment and provides strong returns at today's oil prices. You'll clearly see today that our returns in the Anadarko Basin continue to improve.
Even with the backdrop of low oil prices, we believe it makes sense to further consolidate into one of the industry's best plays and use our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin. Competition for acreage in the STACK region has increased in the face of better drilling results. We are successfully adding late-stage leasehold and extensional acreage today.
With the disconnect between buyer and seller expectations for acquisition opportunities in the region, we view acreage additions as a better value proposition to exploit our distinct operating advantage. Perhaps the drop in oil prices and the realization that oil prices could stay lower for longer will create more reasonable acquisition opportunities for us in the future.
Before we go into the second quarter details, let me quickly summarize what I believe are the key takeaways in today's operations update.
Number one, our well results in STACK are improving. In today's @NFX, we share with you results from an additional 17 STACK wells and continued strong performance from our SCOOP development drilling. To date, we have drilled and completed 46 operated SXL wells in STACK.
Number two, we are rapidly production-delineating our STACK acreage as we push to get it held by production. The wells we have drilled to date are geographically dispersed, and we continue to push rigs towards the edges as we align drilling plans with lease requirements. We are encouraged by the consistent and commercial results we are realizing across the acreage.
The acceleration in STACK allows us to minimize lease renewal cost through higher value drilling investments. The rigs we've added are on a well-to-well basis, and we have the ability to quickly slow investments if oil prices further to deteriorate our cash flow outlook.
Number three, our STACK wells are oil wells. We build our position in STACK in the oil window, and our wells are averaging about 80% black oil in the first 30 days of production. To date, average black oil volumes from our 46 wells are outperforming our type curve assumptions.
Slide 11 in @NFX depicts this outperformance and supports why our confidence is continuing to grow. Later in our remarks, we'll better explain how the play transitions from wet gas to black oil across the play fairway.
Number four, we are testing multiple geologic horizons, and this will be a STACK development play. To date, we have successfully tested the Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. There are other prospective zones that we plan to test in the coming months. To date, about 70% of our STACK wells have been drilled and completed in the Meramec Shale.
We're rapidly lowering our well cost in the Anadarko Basin. This is particularly impressive in STACK, where we are not yet in full field development. Recent wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days, and our recent wells are averaging about $7.9 million including facilities. We hope to keep a good portion of these savings even in a rising oil price environment.
Our well costs today are down about $600,000 from our first quarter update. And we know that in development mode, we will easily shave another $1 million or more off the completed well cost. By analogy, simply look at what our team is delivering today in the Williston Basin.
And lastly, we're accelerating activity and the timing to full field development. By year-end, about 60% of our acreage in STACK will be held by production, and all of our acreage will be HBP by the end of next year. With this increased activity, we now expect that our fourth quarter production from the Anadarko Basin will average about 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, and we expect to deliver strong and economic growth from SCOOP and STACK in 2016. You'll hear more on these topics when Gary provides our operational update a little later.
I'll now turn the call over to Larry Massaro to summarize our second quarter financial results. Larry?"

Financially, the second quarter was very solid.

Financially, the second quarter was very solid. We're seeing the combined benefits of lower service costs, learning curve improvements and efficiency gains and our own efforts to reduce expenses and improve margins across the business.
Year-to-date, we've invested about $730 million, excluding capitalized interest and internal costs. We expected that our investments in the second half of the year will approximate to first half, including about $400 million in the third quarter and $275 million in the fourth quarter. Our capital investment budget for the year is $1.4 billion, up $200 million. The increase is attributable to 20,000 new acres in the Anadarko Basin, increased drilling activity and faster drilling times.
In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and strong well performance. Our domestic production in the second quarter came in at the upper end of our guidance, despite losing about 200,000 barrels equivalent related to weather and our midstream provider's curtailment in SCOOP.
Total production in the second quarter was 14.1 million barrels equivalent, of which 51% was oil and 65% was liquids. Our domestic production grew about 7% quarter-over-quarter to 12.4 million barrels equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 13%. More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 22% year-over-year.
The strength in our production year-to-date has allowed us to raise our full year guidance to 53.5 million to 55 million barrels equivalent, with all of the increase attributed to our domestic operations. Our domestic production is now expected to be 48.5 million to 50 million barrels equivalent.
Discretionary cash flow from operations was $347 million or $2.14 per share, topping consensus estimates.
Adjusted net income for the quarter, excluding several one-time items detailed in our earnings release, was $0.46 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full cost accounting and significantly lower commodity price in the 12-month trailing average.
We have taken both prompt and significant steps to improve our cost structure across the company. In the second quarter, our reoccurring lease operating expenses was well below guidance at $4.60 per BOE. Second quarter LOE was lower than our full year run rate due to the timing of expected expenditures. We again lowered our full year LOE expectation to $5.20 per BOE.
As we noted last quarter, our recent restructuring and headcount reductions will reduce future G&A expense by $40 million a year, and our annual interest expense would drop by about $10 million a year due to lower interest rates associated with our debt refinancing earlier this year.
As Lee referenced, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. As we seek to leverage our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin and our desire to transition to full field development in STACK later next year, we know we must tailor our investment levels to the oil price environment and our cash flow expectations. 
If oil prices stay in a sub-$50 per barrel range, we would likely reduce our 2016 expenditures to maintenance mode levels. We estimate that we could maintain our domestic production levels for about $1 billion. Should prices strengthen to $55 to $60 per barrel, we are capable of strong domestic production growth, supported by improving rates of return with a capital budget similar to 2015 investment levels. Newfield clearly has high-quality options today.
At the end of the second quarter, there was nothing drawn on our revolver, and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We are fortunate to be well hedged with cash flow significantly protected into 2017. 
I'll turn the call over to Gary Packer for the operations update."

As you know, we are only allocating drilling capital to 2 areas today, the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. So let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK.In addition to STA",968,"Thanks, Larry. As you know, we are only allocating drilling capital to 2 areas today, the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. So let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK.
In addition to STACK, we continue to see great results from our SCOOP and Springer plays and look forward to testing other potential geologic horizon in the basin over time.
During the second quarter, we brought online 14 new SCOOP oil wells, including our first SXL well in the Springer Shale. We continue to see good results in the development, where we are running 5 rigs today.
Our overall program has shifted more heavily to STACK and SCOOP oil, and the results are evident through our high oil cuts. We have 8 rigs running in STACK today. One of our most encouraging data points in today's update relates to our consistency in the STACK wells.
On Slide 7 in @NFX, we provide 30-day average production rates for 17 new wells stretched across the acreage, which covers more than 300 square miles. We now have 46 SXL wells, of which 32 have been completed in the Meramec Shale. We are confident that a significant portion of our acreage will be developed with STACK wells in both the Meramec and the Woodford. We have drilled 5 pseudo-pilots to date to test horizontal and vertical well spacing, some of which have been online for more than 1 year now. Although early, these pilots are providing encouraging results.
Please reference the geologic illustration on Slide 12 in @NFX. To date, we have successfully tested multiple wells in Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. We have more than 700 foot of saturated interval across the large portion of our acreage, and we have taken whole course towards the acreage to better understand reservoir quality and reservoir thickness. As expected, our STACK results continue to improve, reflecting the rapid advancements we are making in our drilling and completion operations. Our most recent wells have higher 30- and 60-day rates. Not all the wells have 90-day production rates yet.
On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from these wells averaged nearly 80% over the first 30 days. We are not surprised by these high oil cuts. In fact, we intentionally captured the oil window with our initial leasing concept.
Slide 9 is important to understand. As you move from the dry gas Cana field to the north and east across our acreage, the play transitions from a wet gas to a black oil. Note that the 30-day average oil cuts across the acreage.
In addition to our first Meramec well, drilled some 4 years ago now, we also had production data for more than 3,000 vertical wells drilled over the last 50 years. These wells comingle production from a multiple zones, all sourced by the Woodford.
The GOR, or gas-oil ratios, we are seeing today are very consistent with historical production data, our predrill reservoir modeling and our type curves. Recent well results from our north STACK acreage help validate our encouragement, and our GOR assumptions appear to be very sound.
In the first quarter, we introduced Slide 11, which originally just showed our expected oil cumes over the first decade of production. Today, we enhance disclosure by providing you with the actual production from the 46 SXL wells we have drilled to date. You can see that the wells are highly correlative to our type curve. Furthermore, we today provided actual cumes on 21 Meramec wells with tighter frac cluster spacing. Some of these wells have now been online for nearly 1 year. Tighter frac cluster spacing is generating significantly higher oil production and has now become our norm. We continue to optimize our completion designs. You can see we are making great strides.
Based on our 950,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve and today's lower cost, our wells are expected to pay out in just 2 years. Our returns are being enhanced by higher oil production early and the significant reductions we are making in well cost.
See slides 14 and 15 in @NFX. It's important to understand that more than half of the cost savings we have seen to date are related to efficiencies as demonstrated by reductions in days versus depth and not simply lower service cost.
Our most recent drill in complete cost in STACK was  $7.9 million, down $600,000 from our first quarter average. We frequently participate in wells operated by others, and from this data, we know that we are clearly leading the industry in drilling days and cost. Our days to depth on our most recent operated wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days.
The real prize lies in development mode, where we are certain that we will achieve at least another $1 million savings in our completed well cost, and our teams are pushing to get us there as soon as possible.
As for other active development plays, let me close with a quick update on the Williston Basin. Our team continues to find innovative ways to improve our margins through faster drilling times, improved efficiencies and optimized completions. Recent SXL wells in the Williston Basin have been drilled in about 14 days and for an all-in cost with facilities of about $5.5 million.
Newfield has a long and proven history of driving learning curves and improving returns in full field development. Williston is a great example but you can review recent history and see the same trends in the Eagle Ford, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and in SCOOP. Williston is a great proxy for where we will ultimately be heading in our STACK development.
I'll now turn the call back to Lee for closing remarks."

But I think we've been crystal clear, at least I hope we've been, I'll try to make it crystal clear in response to your question, that for nonstrategic assets, it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when.

We have no pressing need to sell it, but certainly, at the right place and time, we would sell nonstrategic assets to further accelerate activity in Anadarko.

You can go back and look at the add-in effects and see the progression year-by-year. So these are the best kind of gains largely. They're the gains from exceptional teamwork and exceptional talent, driving down the learning curve.

We've tested multiple levels within the Upper Meramec, multiple levels within the Lower Meramec, and we've tested the Woodford. So we've got 3 horizons that are all working very, very nicely.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for dialing in for our Third Quarter Conference Call. Your investment in our company is very much appreciated and look forward to providing you with a solid operation an update today as well as taking your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. It's hard to believe that 2015 is drawing to  a close. Despite the challenges presented by low commodity prices, Newfield has worked to differentiate itself from the pack through solid execution, quality assets and a sound business plan. We're executing very well across the organization today. Although the lion's share of capital is being invested in the Anadarko Basin, we continue to deliver best-in-class wells in the Williston Basin and we're actively working to improve our base production levels and reduce our cost structure across the enterprise, we truly have on all hands on deck mentality today and we're aligned to deliver on our key goals. Just as important as the production is the progress we've made to lower our cost and expenses. Notice that our third quarter cash operating expenses were significantly lower than guidance. We're building on these efficiencies as we prepare to enter 2016 and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to pursuit of margin expansion. We're successfully our company to be profitable in a lower commodity price world. Newfield's differentiated in several distinct ways today. First, we are focused. over that Friday's, we have sold nonstrategic assets, reinvested proceeds into our plays of the future. We have aligned -- realigned our organizational structure to reduce G&A expenses while deploying talent to out our highest return plays, SCOOP and STACK. Second, we have demonstrated ability to effectively manage the inherent risk in the E&P business. We took proactive steps last year to ensure cash flow by hedging a significant portion of our production into 2017. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through key capital market transactions earlier this year. Our strong financial footing has been prior month the building shareholder value in today's oil price environment. We intend to emerge as a better, stronger and more profitable company when commodity prices recover. And lastly, we are very fortunate to have an asset that can deliver both strong returns and growth in a low oil price environment. The Anadarko Basin offers strong returns today, and we know that development economics will be significantly better tomorrow. We are highly encouraged with the results we're seeing today in the Anadarko Basin. There is a comprehensive update in today's @NFX publication. You will see that our teams continue to advance learning's to deliver superior well results, optimize completions and improve returns. It's important to note the for the first time, our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin has now eclipsed the combined production from the remainder of our domestic assets. This is quite a milestone considering that the SCOOP and STACK plays literally started from scratch just 4 years ago. Due to the strong growth in the Anadarko Basin and our efforts to maximize base production across the company, we today raised our full year expectations for 2015 production, and we will enter 2016 with strong operational momentum. In STACK, we have now really drilled nearly 70 wells and have seen strong well results across our acreage. With each well, we increased gain confidence in the play, although the primary focus of our STACK-driven program is the HBPR acreage, we are learning about Williston Basin, both on the surface and sub-surface, and we will be ready to enter full field development in 2017. Our growing Anadarko Basin assets provide us with a deep inventory of high return drilling locations that will lead Newfield's growth and profitability for many years to come. Other critical 2015 initiatives relate to our efforts to improve margins across the company. We have worked to significantly improve our cost structure. These gains have many contributors, including high-grade capital investments; reduced service cost; innovative efforts to lower LOE; redeployment of our people; and the rightsizing of our workforce. Our estimated 2015 lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis are expected to be nearly 25% below 2014 levels. We're expecting that LOE will be down an additional 5% to 10% from current levels in 2016. Our 2015 estimated net G&A expense will be down about $25 million over 2014 levels, adjusted for onetime reorganization costs. Our 2016 G&A expense is expected to be down $40 million from this year's level.
In addition, our future realized prices are expected to improve in STACK through better oil price differentials it was in great demand for our STACK barrels today due to both API gravity, crude quality and geographic location.
Before covering our financial results for the third quarter, let me make a few preliminary comments about 2016 and how we are seeing our business plan taking shape. We're running multiple scenarios in preparation for 2016. Although fluid, I can share with you some of the bookends around our analysis. First, we're working toward a capital budget that substantially balances with our expectations for cash flow, inclusive of hedge revenues. As we said repeatedly, our primary focus today is on maintaining liquidity and a strong balance sheet. We expect to enter 2016 with ample capacity under our $1.8 billion credit facility. This is an investment-grade facility with no redetermination concerns. It's term was extended only of this year up to 2020. We estimate that our maintenance capital funding level is around $900 million, nearly $800 million would be associated with drilling and completions and the remainder will be allocated to infrastructure, leasehold and land renewals. At today's strip prices, our 2016 hedges should add about $260 million in revenues. 
This year Anadarko Basin volumes will be up nearly 50% over 2014 levels. We enter 2016 with momentum and expect that the continuing growth of SCOOP and STACK in 2016 will more than offset the natural declines in our other domestic areas that are not receiving capital investments today. Our production throughout 2016 is expected to be relatively flat throughout the course of the year should we undertake maintenance capital investment levels. This will put us in a great position to accelerate, and again, focus on strong growth once the commodity prices provide the appropriate capitalist. We plan this for our final 2016 capital budgeting and guidance along with our fourth quarter and year-end earnings in February of 2016. We are confident in our plan's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, generate lower operating cost, improve our returns in advance STACK to a full field development in 2017. 
Let me quickly cover our financial results for the third quarter. Increasing volumes, coupled with improved costs in the unit production basis define the quarter's highlights. Margin improvements were evident in our cash operating cost. On a unit of production basis, LOE was 15% below our guidance for the quarter and nearly 25% below the comparable period in 2014. G&A expense, excluding onetime costs associated with our reduction in force, and restructuring cost was about $3 million less than guidance. Our capital investment budget for the year remains approximately $1.4 billion and includes capital invested year-to-date to acquire additional land and leasehold in the Anadarko Basin. For the first 9 months of this year, we sold $77 million of nonstrategic assets as we continue to refine our portfolio and high-grade investments. Year-to-date we've invested about $1.1 billion, excluding capitalized interest and internal cost. There's a helpful table on Page 4 add @NFX that outlets capital investments by quarter, which includes our change in accruals. In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections to slide execution and improving well performance. Our domestic production in the third quarter exceeded our guidance mid-point by 400,000 barrels led by the Anadarko Basin. For the third quarter, our production in the Anadarko Basin came in about 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our forecast, split equally among our 3 primary commodity products. Total production in the third quarter was 14.3 million of oil equivalent, of which is 63% was liquids. Our consolidated oral production during the quarter, was 42% higher than the same period of 2014 adjusted for asset sales.
Domestic production was up 10% year-over-year adjusted for asset sales. Domestic production grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. We lifted about 1.4 million barrels of China during the quarter, surpassing our guidance by the about 125,000 barrels. Due to our production outperformance year-to-date, we are again, raising our annual forecast. Our full-year company guidance is now 55.3 million to 55.8 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production is now expected to be 50.0 million to 50.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $280 million or $1.72 per share. Discretionary cash flows were a couple of pennies light to consensus, primarily due to divesting and payouts of previously expense cash settled restricted stock in the third quarter as well as severance and other reorganization costs. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes several onetime items detailed in our release was $0.21 per share. The most significant item was a noncash drilling test why that related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full cost company, discharge have certain expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full cost accounting and significantly lower commodity prices in 12-month trailing average. Let's move onto our operations update. I'll spend the rest of the day in the Anadarko Basin. We're excited about our recent results, which demonstrate material gains in several important areas. First, improving well performance. You can see from today's results that our production from the Anadarko Basin is tracking well above expectations. Today, we raised expectations for our fourth quarter average daily rate from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our beginning of year estimate and 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day come higher than our estimate last quarter. Second, we're seeing continued gains in drilling efficiencies, which are leaning towards lower low-cost. In our STACK play, well cost of the date of the year was $8.5 million. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.5 million or less. Our days to depth are averaging about 16 days and our best-in-class wells start are drilled in 12 days. Third, we're effectively optimizing completions. We're making material advancements in our completions and early results are very promising. And lastly, we're planning for future development. We have a marketing agreements now in plays for both Oil and Gas take away in STACK, and we are developing an extensive network to allow for the distribution, recycling and reuse of our frac flow back this will be advantageous as we enter full field development. Let's talk about each of these again, so starting with the improved well performance. In @NFX, we released results from 22 new SXL wells. We now have 68 wells in our STACK data set and the results have been very consistent across an area that covers more than 1,500 square miles and spans more than 50 miles from corner to corner. In fact, there's a tighter correlation in our STACK results in any of the resource plays we've been associated with today. Our most recent so hundred 30 and 60 the rates and not all the wells yet reached 90 day production rates. Average a 30-day rates from our 22 new wells exceeded last quarter's wells, but 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from our new wells average nearly 80% over the first 30 days of production.By the end of this year, but expect to have drilled about 100 STACK wells. This is a very significant data set and is providing us with high confidence in our future forecast. SCOOP is in full development and pad drilling is generating strong returns. Our recent Williams 5 well pack came on at about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross of which 70% was oil in a 2 stream basis. We had to additional SCOOP pads, and that will begin production shortly and help push our average net production for the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. We continue to lower well cost in STACK through innovative bit designs, mud-in-motor optimizations and the targeting of the most effective drilling zones within the Merrimack and Woodford. Today well cost are about $7.5 million, but more importantly, we can see the path to significantly lower low-cost once we move pad drilling in full field development. We estimate that more than half of the cost-savings seen to date is related to efficiencies and few would optimizations and not simply a result of lower service cost. From our participation in outside operator wells, we know we are leading industry in drilling bass and cost. Perhaps, our most significant others today are coming through recent completion optimizations. Recall that our first 26 STACK wells had identical completions. We felt early that it was critical to have a large consistent samples that across our encourage footprint. In 2015, we began to optimize completions in both SCOOP and STACK adjusting different variables to fund the optimal well for full field development. Recent variables explore the use of zipper fracs, diverting agents, high concentrations of fluids and Provence and slip water fracs. We're very encouraged by the early performance results from these optimizations. With and the larger sample in time, we will know the magnitude of the impact of our EURs and rates of return. Stay tuned, we'll have more to share with you in the way of data that varies soon. We recently cited new agreements that will help ensure we have good markets possible differential for our growing STACK production. As today, our STACK oil is tracked to Cushing, Oklahoma. Under our new agreements, will begin piping about 1/3 of our STACK production in January of 2016 and by the end of the second quarter, 100% of our STACK well be piped into Cushing. We've seen in a growing appetite for our STACK barrel, which is a 42 to 43-degree API a barrel. We will soon have the ability to batch oil to ensure the best price. We expect the differential to NYMEX WTI will decrease from about $4.50 per barrel today to about $2.50 per barrel early next year. As you can tell our remarks today, and we are very encouraged with the continuing progress in the Anadarko Basin. And we'll be happy to discussed additional details during our Q&A. So in closing I'd like to say Newfield is a very good plays today, but we didn't arrive here by chance. We took the steps 12 to 18 months ago and hatched forward all sales to ensure our castle. We have sized an extended our credit facility through 2020, ensuring our liquidity position, eliminating redetermination risk. And we sold $2.5 billion in assets at yesterday's commodity prices. These strategic decisions were timely and help with Newfield in an advantage position to date, despite a vary challenging microenvironment. We are fortunate that we can provide our shareholders with both volumes and value. Growth in shareholder value creation are not mutually exclusive regardless of where we find ourselves in the inevitable commodity price cycles.

The closest we've been able to get, 880 feet, I believe in the reason for that is when you drill across the slide, state couple more books, that's as close that we can get.

It's hard to believe that 2015 is drawing to a close. Despite the challenges presented by low commodity prices, Newfield has worked to differentiate itself from the pack through solid execution, quality assets and a sound business plan. We're executing very well across the organization today. Although the lion's share of the capital is being invested in the Anadarko Basin, we continue to deliver best-in-class wells in the Williston Basin, and we're actively working to improve our base production levels and reduce our cost structure across the enterprise. We truly have an all hands on deck mentality today and we're aligned to deliver on our key goals. Just as important as today's production beat is the progress we've made to lower our cost and expenses. Notice that our third quarter cash operating expenses were significantly lower than guidance. We're building on these efficiencies as we prepare to enter 2016 and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to the pursuit of margin expansion. We're successfully retooling our company to be profitable in a lower commodity price world. Newfield's differentiated in several distinct ways today. First, we are focused. Over that last 5 years, we've sold nonstrategic assets, reinvested proceeds into our plays of the future. We have aligned -- realigned our organizational structure to reduce G&A expenses while deploying talent to our highest return plays, SCOOP and STACK. Second, we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage the inherent risk in the E&P business. We took proactive steps last year to ensure our cash flow by hedging a significant portion of our production into 2017. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through key capital market transactions earlier this year. Our strong financial footing has been paramount to building shareholder value in today's oil price environment. We intend to emerge as a better, stronger and more profitable company when commodity prices recover. And lastly, we are very fortunate to have an asset that can deliver both strong returns and growth in a low oil price environment. The Anadarko Basin offers strong returns today, and we know that development economics will be significantly better tomorrow. We are highly encouraged with the results we're seeing today in the Anadarko Basin. There is a comprehensive update in today's @NFX publication. You will see that our teams continue to advance learnings to deliver superior well results, optimize completions and improve returns. It's important to note the for the first time, our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin has now eclipsed the combined production from the remainder of our domestic assets. This is quite a milestone considering that the SCOOP and STACK plays literally started from scratch just 4 years ago. Due to the strong growth in the Anadarko Basin and our efforts to maximize base production across the company, we, today, raised our full year expectations for 2015 production, and we will enter 2016 with strong operational momentum. In STACK, we have now drilled nearly 70 wells and have seen strong well results across our acreage. With each well, we again increased confidence in the play, although the primary focus of our STACK drilling program is the HBP our acreage, we are learning about well spacing, both on the surface and sub-surface, and we will be ready to enter full field development in 2017. Our growing Anadarko Basin assets provide us with a deep inventory of high return drilling locations that will lead Newfield's growth and profitability for many years to come. Other critical 2015 initiatives relate to our efforts to improve margins across the company. We have worked to significantly improve our cost structure. These gains have many contributors, including high-graded capital investments; reduced service cost; innovative efforts to lower LOE; redeployment of our people; and the rightsizing of our workforce. Our estimated 2015 lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis are expected to be nearly 25% below 2014 levels. We're expecting that LOE will be down an additional 5% to 10% from current levels in 2016. Our 2015 estimated net G&A expense will be down about $25 million over 2014 levels, adjusted for onetime reorganization costs. Our 2016 G&A expense is expected to be down $40 million from this year's level.
In addition, our future realized prices are expected to improve in STACK through better oil price differentials. We're seeing great demand for our STACK barrels today due to both API gravity, crude quality and geographic location.
Before covering our financial results for the third quarter, let me make a few preliminary comments about 2016 and how we are seeing our business plan taking shape. We're running multiple scenarios in preparation for 2016. Although fluid, I can share with you some of the bookends around our analysis. First, we're working toward a capital budget that substantially balances with our expectations for cash flow, inclusive of hedge revenues. As we've said repeatedly, our primary focus today is on maintaining liquidity and a strong balance sheet. We expect to enter 2016 with ample capacity under our $1.8 billion credit facility. This is an investment-grade facility with no redetermination concerns. It's term was extended earlier this year out to 2020. We estimate that our maintenance capital funding level is around $900 million, nearly $800 million would be associated with drilling and completions and the remainder will be allocated to infrastructure, leasehold and land renewals. At today's strip prices, our 2016 hedges should add about $260 million in revenues.
This year, Anadarko Basin volumes will be up nearly 50% over 2014 levels. We enter 2016 with momentum and expect that the continuing growth of SCOOP and STACK in 2016 will more than offset the natural declines in our other domestic areas that are not receiving capital investments today. Our production throughout 2016 is expected to be relatively flat throughout the course of the year should we undertake maintenance capital investment levels. This will put us in a great position to accelerate, and again, focus on strong growth once the commodity prices provide the appropriate catalyst. We plan to issue our final 2016 capital budget and guidance along with our fourth quarter and year-end earnings in February of 2016. We are confident in our plan's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, generate lower operating cost, improve our returns and advance STACK toward full field development in 2017.
Let me quickly recover our financial results for the third quarter. Increasing volumes, coupled with improved costs in the unit production basis define the quarter's highlights. Margin improvements were evident in our cash operating cost. On a unit of production basis, LOE was 15% below our guidance for the quarter and nearly 25% below the comparable period in 2014. G&A expense, excluding onetime costs associated with our reduction in force, and restructuring cost was about $3 million less than guidance. Our capital investment budget for the year remains approximately $1.4 billion and includes capital invested year-to-date to acquire additional land and leasehold in the Anadarko Basin. For the first 9 months of this year, we sold $77 million of nonstrategic assets as we continue to refine our portfolio and high-grade investments. Year-to-date we've invested about $1.1 billion, excluding capitalized interest and internal cost. There's a helpful table on Page 4 in @NFX that outlets capital investments by quarter, which includes our change in accruals. In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and improving well performance. Our domestic production in the third quarter exceeded our guidance midpoint by 400,000 barrels led by the Anadarko Basin. For the third quarter, our production in the Anadarko Basin came in about 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our forecast, split equally among our 3 primary commodity products. Total production in the third quarter was 14.3 million of oil equivalent, of which is 63% was liquids. Our consolidated oral production during the quarter was 42% higher than the same period as 2014, adjusted for asset sales.
Domestic production was up 10% year-over-year, adjusted for asset sales. Domestic production grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. We lifted about 1.4 million barrels of China during the quarter, surpassing our guidance by the about 125,000 barrels. Due to our production outperformance year-to-date, we are, again, raising our annual forecast. Our full year company guidance is now 55.3 million to 55.8 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production is now expected to be 50.0 million to 50.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $280 million or $1.72 per share. Discretionary cash flows were a couple of pennies light to consensus, primarily due to divesting or payout of previously expensed cash settled restricted stock in the third quarter as well as severance and other reorganization costs. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes several onetime items detailed in our release was $0.21 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test right now related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full cost accounting and significantly lower commodity prices in a 12-month trailing average. Let's move onto our operations update. I'll spend the rest of today on the Anadarko Basin. We're excited about our recent results, which demonstrate material gains in several important areas. First, improving well performance. You can see from today's results that our production from the Anadarko Basin is tracking well above expectations. Today, we raised expectations for our fourth quarter average daily rate from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our beginning of year estimate and 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than our estimate last quarter. Second, we're seeing continued gains in drilling efficiencies, which are leading towards lower well cost. In our STACK play, our estimate of well cost at the beginning of the year was $8.5 million. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.5 million or less. Our days to depth are averaging about 16 days and our best-in-class wells start are drilled in 12 days. Third, we're effectively optimizing completions. We're making material advancements in our completions and early results are very promising. And lastly, we're planning for future development. We have a marketing agreements now in plays for both oil and gas takeaway in STACK, and we are developing an extensive network to allow for the distribution, recycling and reuse of our frac flowback water. This will be advantageous as we enter full field development. 
Let's talk about each of these gains starting with the improved well performance. In @NFX, we released results from 22 new SXL wells. We now have 68 wells in our STACK data set and the results have been very consistent across an area that covers more than 1,500 square miles and spans more than 50 miles from corner to corner. In fact, there's a tighter correlation in our STACK results than any of the resource plays we've been associated with today. Our most recent well's in higher 30- and 60-day rates and not all of the wells have yet reached 90-day production rates. Average a 30-day rates from our 22 new wells exceeded last quarter's wells by 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from our new wells average nearly 80% over the first 30 days of production.By the end of this year, we expect to have drilled about 100 STACK wells. This is a very significant data set and is providing us with high confidence in our future forecast. SCOOP is in full development and pad drilling is generating strong returns. Our recent Williams 5-well pad came on at about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross of which 70% was oil on a 2-stream basis. We had 2 additional SCOOP pads that will begin production shortly and help push our average net production from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. We continue to lower well cost in STACK through innovative bit designs, mud and motor optimizations and the targeting of the most effective drilling zones within the Meramec and Woodford. Today, well cost are about $7.5 million, but more importantly, we can see the path to significantly lower well cost once we move to pad drilling in full field development. We estimate that more than half of the cost savings seen to-date is related to efficiencies and fuel optimizations and not simply a result of lower service cost. From our participation in outside operator wells, we know we are leading industry in drilling days and cost. Perhaps, our most significant developments today are coming through recent completion optimizations. Recall that our first 26 STACK wells had identical completions. We felt early that it was critical to have a large consistent sample set across our acreage footprint. In 2015, we began to optimize completions in both SCOOP and STACK, adjusting different variables to fund the optimal well for full field development. Recent variables explore the use of zipper fracs, diverting agents, high concentrations of fluids and proppants and slip water fracs. We're very encouraged by the early performance results from these optimizations. Within a larger sample set in time, we will know the magnitude of the impact on our EURs and rates of return. Stay tuned, we'll have more to share with you in the way of data very soon. 
We recently signed new agreements that will help ensure that we have good markets in the possible differentials for our growing STACK production. As today, our STACK oil is trucked to Cushing, Oklahoma. Under our new agreements, we will begin piping about 1/3 of our STACK production in January of 2016 and by the end of the second quarter, 100% of our STACK oil be piped into Cushing. We've seen a growing appetite for our STACK barrel, which is a 42 to 45-degree API barrel. We will soon have the ability to batch oil to ensure the best price. We expect our differential to NYMEX WTI will decrease from about $4.50 per barrel today to about $2.50 per barrel early next year. As you can tell, our remarks today, we are very encouraged with the continuing progress that we're making in the Anadarko Basin. And we'll be happy to discussed additional details during our Q&A. 
So in closing, I'd like to say Newfield is in a very good plays today. We didn't arrive here by chance. We took the right steps 12 to 18 months ago and hedged forward all sales to ensure our cash flow. We upsized and extended our credit facility through 2020, ensuring our liquidity position and eliminating redetermination risk, and we sold $2.5 billion in assets at yesterday's commodity prices. These strategic decisions were timely and help with Newfield in an advantage position today despite a vary challenging microenvironment. We are fortunate that we can provide our shareholders with both volumes and value. Growth in shareholder value creation are not mutually exclusive regardless of where we find ourselves in the inevitable commodity price cycles.

I think it's important when you look at the Anadarko Basin and SCOOP and STACK, and I'll get to that specific question in a moment, so remember that we're drilling across various positions within phase envelopes. So you're going to see a natural variation across the play. We've got plenty of data. We know where we are in the phase envelopes, so we know what the expectations are, but from quarter-to-quarter or data set to data set, you'll have pad wells coming into play. And as we move towards the development, you'll have both the noise that comes in from OBO activity as well, but small variations, a few percentage points, one way or the other, are nothing could be concerned about. So what I would tell you, in the SCOOP wells, and we have the 5-well pad that was referenced, we're very, very pleased with the results and they're in line with our expectations in the play. And the same is true with regard to STACK. I can't think of the last time we had any surprises with regard to face composition and production types in this play. We got plenty of data, and it's pretty well-defined at this stage."

We've not seen any negative interference effects or degradation. So another thing to be very pleased with. The closest we've been able to get, 880 feet, I believe, and the reason for that is when you drill across lease lines, State of Oklahoma rules, that's as close as we can get. So practically speaking, that's about 6 wells per horizon, if you wanted to think about it at that level. I think we feel pretty comfortable with the results we're seeing there. We'll have to wait for the mood to shift into development to drill multi-well pilots, and I'm sure we'll test spacing tighter than that once we get there.

So we're working on the development well designs today. We want compact, tight, complex fraction networks, and that's really what the focus is. I would take you back, I don't know if we've talked, Dan, but I'm sure you've heard Steve and others and some of the materials we've put out. I love looking at what the team's accomplished in the Williston Basin. And we're drilling and completing 21,000, 22,000-foot wells there today for $5 million, including facilities. And those wells are virtually identical to the types of wells that we'll be drilling in STACK. So we get to development mode, I wouldn't bet against Newfield."

It's hard to believe that 2015 is drawing to a close. Despite the challenges presented by low commodity prices, Newfield has worked to differentiate itself from the pack through solid execution, quality assets and a sound business plan. We're executing very well across the organization today. Although the lion's share of capital is being invested in the Anadarko Basin, we continue to deliver best-in-class wells in the Williston Basin, and we're actively working to improve our base production levels and reduce our cost structure across the enterprise. We truly have an all-hands-on-deck mentality today and we're aligned to deliver on our key goals. Just as important as today's production beat is the progress we've made to lower our cost and expenses. Notice that our third quarter cash operating expenses were significantly lower than guidance. We're building on these efficiencies as we prepare to enter 2016 and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to the pursuit of margin expansion. We're successfully retooling our company to be profitable in a lower commodity price world. Newfield's differentiated in several distinct ways today. First, we are focused. Over the last 5 years, we have sold nonstrategic assets, reinvested proceeds into our plays of the future. We have aligned -- realigned our organizational structure to reduce G&A expenses while deploying talent to our highest-return plays, SCOOP and STACK. Second, we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage the inherent risk in the E&P business. We took proactive steps last year to ensure our cash flow by hedging a significant portion of our production into 2017. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through key capital market transactions earlier this year. Our strong financial footing has been paramount to building shareholder value in today's oil price environment. We intend to emerge as a better, stronger and more profitable company when commodity prices recover. And lastly, we are very fortunate to have an asset that can deliver both strong returns and growth in a low oil price environment. The Anadarko Basin offers strong returns today, and we know that development economics will be significantly better tomorrow. We are highly encouraged with the results we are seeing today in the Anadarko Basin. There is a comprehensive update in today's @NFX publication. You will see that our teams continue to advance learnings to deliver superior well results, optimize completions and improve returns. It's important to note that for the first time, our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin has now eclipsed the combined production from the remainder of our domestic assets. This is quite a milestone considering that the SCOOP and STACK plays literally started from scratch just 4 years ago. Due to the strong growth in the Anadarko Basin and our efforts to maximize base production across the company, we, today, raised our full year expectations for 2015 production, and we will enter 2016 with strong operational momentum. In STACK, we have now drilled nearly 70 wells and have seen strong well results across our acreage. With each well, we gain increased confidence in the play, although the primary focus of our STACK drilling program is the HBP our acreage, we are learning about well spacing, both on the surface and sub-surface, and we will be ready to enter full field development in 2017. Our growing Anadarko Basin assets provide us with a deep inventory of high-return drilling locations that will lead Newfield's growth and profitability for many years to come. Other critical 2015 initiatives relate to our efforts to improve margins across the company. We have worked to significantly improve our cost structure. These gains have many contributors, including high-graded capital investments; reduced service costs; innovative efforts to lower LOE; redeployment of our people; and the rightsizing of our workforce. Our estimated 2015 lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis are expected to be nearly 25% below 2014 levels. We're expecting that LOE will be down an additional 5% to 10% from current levels in 2016. Our 2015 estimated net G&A expense will be down about $25 million over 2014 levels, adjusted for onetime reorganization costs. Our 2016 G&A expense is expected to be down $40 million from this year's level.
In addition, our future realized prices are expected to improve in STACK through better oil price differentials. We're seeing great demand for our STACK barrels today due to both API gravity, crude quality and geographic location.
Before covering our financial results for the third quarter, let me make a few preliminary comments about 2016 and how we are seeing our business plan taking shape. We're running multiple scenarios in preparation for 2016. Although fluid, I can share with you some of the bookends around our analysis. First, we're working toward a capital budget that substantially balances with our expectations for cash flow, inclusive of hedge revenues. As we've said repeatedly, our primary focus today is on maintaining liquidity and a strong balance sheet. We expect to enter 2016 with ample capacity under our $1.8 billion credit facility. This is an investment-grade facility with no redetermination concerns. It's term was extended earlier this year out to 2020. We estimate that our maintenance capital funding level is around $900 million, nearly $800 million would be associated with drilling and completions and the remainder would be allocated to infrastructure, leasehold and land renewals. At today's strip prices, our 2016 hedges should add about $260 million in revenues.
This year, Anadarko Basin volumes will be up nearly 50% over 2014 levels. We enter 2016 with momentum and expect that the continuing growth of SCOOP and STACK in 2016 will more than offset the natural declines in our other domestic areas that are not receiving capital investments today. Our production throughout 2016 is expected to be relatively flat throughout the course of the year should we undertake maintenance capital investment levels. This will put us in a great position to accelerate, and again focus on strong growth once the commodity prices provide the appropriate catalysts. We plan to issue our final 2016 capital budget and guidance along with our fourth quarter and year-end earnings in February of 2016. We are confident in our plan's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, generate lower operating cost, improve our returns and advance STACK toward full field development in 2017.
Let me quickly cover our financial results for the third quarter. Increasing volumes, coupled with improved costs in the unit production basis define the quarter's highlights. Margin improvements were evident in our cash operating cost. On a unit of production basis, LOE was 15% below our guidance for the quarter and nearly 25% below the comparable period in 2014. G&A expense, excluding onetime costs associated with our reduction in force, and restructuring cost was about $3 million less than guidance. Our capital investment budget for the year remains approximately $1.4 billion and includes capital invested year-to-date to acquire additional land and leasehold in the Anadarko Basin. Through the first 9 months of this year, we sold $77 million of nonstrategic assets as we continue to refine our portfolio and high-grade investments. Year-to-date we've invested about $1.1 billion, excluding capitalized interest and internal cost. There is a helpful table on Page 4 in @NFX that outlets capital investments by quarter, which includes our change in accruals. In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and improving well performance. Our domestic production in the third quarter exceeded our guidance midpoint by 400,000 barrels led by the Anadarko Basin. For the third quarter, our production in the Anadarko Basin came in about 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our forecast, split equally among our 3 primary commodity products. Total production in the third quarter was 14.3 million of oil equivalent, of which 63% was liquids. Our consolidated oil production during the quarter was 42% higher than the same period as 2014, adjusted for asset sales.
Domestic production was up 10% year-over-year, adjusted for asset sales. Domestic production grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. We lifted about 1.4 million barrels to China during the quarter, surpassing our guidance by the about 125,000 barrels. Due to our production outperformance year-to-date, we are, again, raising our annual forecast. Our full year company guidance is now 55.3 million to 55.8 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production is now expected to be 50.0 million to 50.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $280 million or $1.72 per share. Discretionary cash flows were $0.02 light to consensus, primarily due to divesting or payout of previously expensed cash settled restricted stock in the third quarter as well as severance and other reorganization costs. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes several onetime items detailed in our release, was $0.21 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test right now related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full-cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full-cost accounting and significantly lower commodity prices in a 12-month trailing average. Let's move on to our operations update. I'll spend the rest of today on the Anadarko Basin. We're excited about our recent results, which demonstrate material gains in several important areas. First, improving well performance. You can see from today's results that our production from the Anadarko Basin is tracking well above expectations. Today, we raised expectations for our fourth quarter average daily rate from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our beginning of year estimate and 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than our estimate last quarter. Second, we're seeing continued gains in drilling efficiencies, which are leading towards lower well cost. In our STACK play, our estimate of well cost at the beginning of the year was $8.5 million. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.5 million or less. Our days to depth are averaging about 16 days and our best-in-class wells are drilled in 12 days. Third, we're effectively optimizing completions. We're making material advancements in our completions, and early results are very promising. And lastly, we're planning for future development. We have a marketing agreements now in place for both oil and gas takeaway in STACK, and we are developing an extensive network to allow for the distribution, recycling and reuse of our frac flowback water. This will be advantageous as we enter full-field development. 
Let's talk about each of these gains starting with the improved well performance. In @NFX, we released results from 22 new SXL wells. We now have 68 wells in our STACK data set and the results have been very consistent across an area that covers more than 1,500 square miles and spans more than 50 miles from corner to corner. In fact, there's a tighter correlation in our STACK results than any of the resource plays we've been associated with to date. Our most recent wells have higher 30- and 60-day rates and not all of the wells have yet reached 90-day production rates. Average a 30-day rates from our 22 new wells exceeded last quarter's wells by 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from our new wells average nearly 80% over the first 30 days of production. By the end of this year, we expect to have drilled about 100 STACK wells. This is a very significant data set and is providing us with high confidence in our future forecast. SCOOP is in full development and pad drilling is generating strong returns. Our recent Williams 5-well pad came on at about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross, of which 70% was oil on a 2-stream basis. We had 2 additional SCOOP pads that will begin production shortly and help push our average net production from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. We continue to lower well costs in STACK through innovative bit designs, mud and motor optimizations and the targeting of the most effective drilling zones within the Meramec and Woodford. Today, well costs are about $7.5 million, but more importantly, we can see the path to significantly lower well costs once we move to pad drilling in full field development. We estimate that more than half of the cost savings seen to date is related to efficiencies and fuel optimizations and not simply a result of lower service cost. From our participation in outside operator wells, we know we are leading industry in drilling days and costs. Perhaps, our most significant developments to date are coming through recent completion optimizations. Recall that our first 26 STACK wells have identical completions. We felt early that it was critical to have a large, consistent sample set across our acreage footprint. In 2015, we began to optimize completions in both SCOOP and STACK, adjusting different variables to find the optimal well for full field development. Recent variables explore the use of zipper fracs, diverting agents, high concentrations of fluids and proppants and slip water fracs. We're very encouraged by the early performance results from these optimizations. Within a larger sample set in time, we will know the magnitude of the impact on our EURs and rates of return. Stay tuned, we'll have more to share with you in the way of data very soon. 
We recently signed new agreements that will help ensure that we have good markets in the possible differentials for our growing STACK production. As today, our STACK oil is trucked to Cushing, Oklahoma. Under our new agreements, we will begin piping about 1/3 of our STACK production in January of 2016 and by the end of the second quarter, 100% of our STACK oil will be piped into Cushing. We've seen a growing appetite for our STACK barrel, which is a 42- to 45-degree API barrel. We will soon have the ability to batch our oil to ensure the best price. We expect our differential to NYMEX WTI will decrease from about $4.50 per barrel today to about $2.50 per barrel early next year. As you can tell in our remarks today, we are very encouraged with the continuing progress that we're making in the Anadarko Basin. And we'll be happy to discussed additional details during our Q&A. 
So in closing, I'd like to say Newfield is in a very good place today. We didn't arrive here by chance. We took the right steps 12 to 18 months ago and hedged forward oil sales to ensure our cash flow. We upsized and extended our credit facility through 2020, ensuring our liquidity position and eliminating redetermination risk, and we sold $2.5 billion in assets at yesterday's commodity prices. These strategic decisions were timely and help with Newfield in an advantaged position today despite a very challenging microenvironment. We are fortunate that we can provide our shareholders with both volumes and value. Growth in shareholder value creation are not mutually exclusive regardless of where we find ourselves in the inevitable commodity price cycles.

I think the results that we've seen from all of the wells that we've released to date have been in line or above the published type curves, so we've been very pleased there. We've not seen any negative interference effects or degradation. So another thing to be very pleased with. The closest we've been able to get is 880 feet, I believe. And the reason for that is when you drill across lease lines, the State of Oklahoma rules, that's as close as we can get. So practically speaking, that's about 6 wells per horizon, if you wanted to think about it at that level. I think we feel pretty comfortable with the results we're seeing there. We'll have to wait for the mood to shift into development to drill multi-well pilots, and I'm sure we'll test spacing tighter than that once we get there. But right now, we're very encouraged with the results. We'll continue to add to the data set. When we get the acreage footprint, HBP, that's going to be a pretty fantastic place to be.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for dialing in to our Third Quarter Conference Call. Your investment in our company is very much appreciated and we look forward to providing you with a solid operational update today, as well as taking your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. 
It's hard to believe that 2015 is drawing to a close. Despite the challenges presented by low commodity prices, Newfield has worked to differentiate itself from the pack through solid execution, quality assets and a sound business plan. We're executing very well across the organization today. Although the lion's share of capital is being invested in the Anadarko Basin, we continue to deliver best-in-class wells in the Williston Basin, and we're actively working to improve our base production levels and reduce our cost structure across the enterprise. We truly have an all-hands-on-deck mentality today and we're aligned to deliver on our key goals. Just as important as today's production beat is the progress we've made to lower our cost and expenses. 
Notice that our third quarter cash operating expenses were significantly lower than guidance. We're building on these efficiencies as we prepare to enter 2016 and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to the pursuit of margin expansion. We're successfully retooling our company to be profitable in a lower commodity price world. Newfield's differentiated in several distinct ways today. First, we are focused. Over the last 5 years, we have sold nonstrategic assets, reinvested proceeds into our plays of the future. We have aligned -- realigned our organizational structure to reduce G&A expenses while deploying talent to our highest-return plays, SCOOP and STACK. 
Second, we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage the inherent risk in the E&P business. We took proactive steps last year to ensure our cash flow by hedging a significant portion of our production into 2017. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through key capital market transactions earlier this year. Our strong financial footing has been paramount to building shareholder value in today's oil price environment. We intend to emerge as a better, stronger and more profitable company when commodity prices recover. And lastly, we are very fortunate to have an asset that can deliver both strong returns and growth in a low oil price environment. 
The Anadarko Basin offers strong returns today, and we know that development economics will be significantly better tomorrow. We are highly encouraged with the results we are seeing today in the Anadarko Basin. There is a comprehensive update in today's @NFX publication. You will see that our teams continue to advance learnings to deliver superior well results, optimize completions and improve returns. It's important to note that for the first time, our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin has now eclipsed the combined production from the remainder of our domestic assets. This is quite a milestone considering that the SCOOP and STACK plays literally started from scratch just 4 years ago. Due to the strong growth in the Anadarko Basin and our efforts to maximize base production across the company, we, today, raised our full year expectations for 2015 production, and we will enter 2016 with strong operational momentum. 
In STACK, we have now drilled nearly 70 wells and have seen strong well results across our acreage. With each well, we gain increased confidence in the play, although the primary focus of our STACK drilling program is the HBP our acreage, we are learning about well spacing, both on the surface and sub-surface, and we will be ready to enter full field development in 2017. Our growing Anadarko Basin assets provide us with a deep inventory of high-return drilling locations that will lead Newfield's growth and profitability for many years to come. Other critical 2015 initiatives relate to our efforts to improve margins across the company. 
We have worked to significantly improve our cost structure. These gains have many contributors, including high-graded capital investments; reduced service costs; innovative efforts to lower LOE; redeployment of our people; and the rightsizing of our workforce. Our estimated 2015 lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis are expected to be nearly 25% below 2014 levels. We're expecting that LOE will be down an additional 5% to 10% from current levels in 2016. Our 2015 estimated net G&A expense will be down about $25 million over 2014 levels, adjusted for onetime reorganization costs. Our 2016 G&A expense is expected to be down $40 million from this year's level.
In addition, our future realized prices are expected to improve in STACK through better oil price differentials. We're seeing great demand for our STACK barrels today due to both API gravity, crude quality and geographic location.
Before covering our financial results for the third quarter, let me make a few preliminary comments about 2016 and how we are seeing our business plan taking shape. We're running multiple scenarios in preparation for 2016. Although fluid, I can share with you some of the bookends around our analysis. First, we're working toward a capital budget that substantially balances with our expectations for cash flow, inclusive of hedge revenues. As we've said repeatedly, our primary focus today is on maintaining liquidity and a strong balance sheet. We expect to enter 2016 with ample capacity under our $1.8 billion credit facility. This is an investment-grade facility with no redetermination concerns. Its term was extended earlier this year out to 2020. We estimate that our maintenance capital funding level is around $900 million, nearly $800 million would be associated with drilling and completions and the remainder would be allocated to infrastructure, leasehold and land renewals. At today's strip prices, our 2016 hedges should add about $260 million in revenues.
This year, Anadarko Basin volumes will be up nearly 50% over 2014 levels. We enter 2016 with momentum and expect that the continuing growth of SCOOP and STACK in 2016 will more than offset the natural declines in our other domestic areas that are not receiving capital investments today. Our production throughout 2016 is expected to be relatively flat throughout the course of the year should we undertake maintenance capital investment levels. This will put us in a great position to accelerate, and again focus on strong growth once the commodity prices provide the appropriate catalysts. We plan to issue our final 2016 capital budget and guidance along with our fourth quarter and year-end earnings in February of 2016. We are confident in our plan's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, generate lower operating cost, improve our returns and advance STACK toward full field development in 2017.
Let me quickly cover our financial results for the third quarter. Increasing volumes, coupled with improved costs in the unit production basis define the quarter's highlights. Margin improvements were evident in our cash operating cost. On a unit of production basis, LOE was 15% below our guidance for the quarter and nearly 25% below the comparable period in 2014. G&A expense, excluding onetime costs associated with our reduction in force, and restructuring cost was about $3 million less than guidance. 
Our capital investment budget for the year remains approximately $1.4 billion and includes capital invested year-to-date to acquire additional land and leasehold in the Anadarko Basin. Through the first 9 months of this year, we sold $77 million of nonstrategic assets as we continue to refine our portfolio and high-grade investments. Year-to-date we've invested about $1.1 billion, excluding capitalized interest and internal cost. There is a helpful table on Page 4 in @NFX that outlets capital investments by quarter, which includes our change in accruals. 
In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and improving well performance. Our domestic production in the third quarter exceeded our guidance midpoint by 400,000 barrels led by the Anadarko Basin. For the third quarter, our production in the Anadarko Basin came in about 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our forecast, split equally among our 3 primary commodity products. Total production in the third quarter was 14.3 million of oil equivalent, of which 63% was liquids. Our consolidated oil production during the quarter was 42% higher than the same period as 2014, adjusted for asset sales.
Domestic production was up 10% year-over-year, adjusted for asset sales. Domestic production grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. We lifted about 1.4 million barrels to China during the quarter, surpassing our guidance by the about 125,000 barrels. Due to our production outperformance year-to-date, we are, again, raising our annual forecast. Our full year company guidance is now 55.3 million to 55.8 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production is now expected to be 50.0 million to 50.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $280 million or $1.72 per share. Discretionary cash flows were a couple of pennies light to consensus, primarily due to divesting or payout of previously expensed cash settled restricted stock in the third quarter as well as severance and other reorganization costs. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes several onetime items detailed in our release, was $0.21 per share. The most significant item was a noncash ceiling test right now related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full-cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a noncash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full-cost accounting and significantly lower commodity prices in a 12-month trailing average. Let's move on to our operations update. I'll spend the rest of today on the Anadarko Basin. 
We're excited about our recent results, which demonstrate material gains in several important areas. First, improving well performance. You can see from today's results that our production from the Anadarko Basin is tracking well above expectations. Today, we raised expectations for our fourth quarter average daily rate from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our beginning of year estimate and 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than our estimate last quarter. Second, we're seeing continued gains in drilling efficiencies, which are leading towards lower well cost. 
In our STACK play, our estimate of well cost at the beginning of the year was $8.5 million. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.5 million or less. Our days to depth are averaging about 16 days and our best-in-class wells are drilled in 12 days. Third, we're effectively optimizing completions. We're making material advancements in our completions, and early results are very promising. And lastly, we're planning for future development. We have a marketing agreements now in place for both oil and gas takeaway in STACK, and we are developing an extensive network to allow for the distribution, recycling and reuse of our frac flowback water. This will be advantageous as we enter full-field development. 
Let's talk about each of these gains starting with the improved well performance. In @NFX, we released results from 22 new SXL wells. We now have 68 wells in our STACK data set and the results have been very consistent across an area that covers more than 1,500 square miles and spans more than 50 miles from corner to corner. In fact, there's a tighter correlation in our STACK results than any of the resource plays we've been associated with to date. Our most recent wells have higher 30- and 60-day rates and not all of the wells have yet reached 90-day production rates. 
Average a 30-day rates from our 22 new wells exceeded last quarter's wells by 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from our new wells average nearly 80% over the first 30 days of production. By the end of this year, we expect to have drilled about 100 STACK wells. This is a very significant data set and is providing us with high confidence in our future forecast. SCOOP is in full development and pad drilling is generating strong returns. Our recent Williams 5-well pad came on at about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross, of which 70% was oil on a 2-stream basis. 
We had 2 additional SCOOP pads that will begin production shortly and help push our average net production from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. We continue to lower well costs in STACK through innovative bit designs, mud and motor optimizations and the targeting of the most effective drilling zones within the Meramec and Woodford. Today, well costs are about $7.5 million, but more importantly, we can see the path to significantly lower well costs once we move to pad drilling in full field development. We estimate that more than half of the cost savings seen to date is related to efficiencies and fuel optimizations and not simply a result of lower service cost. 
From our participation in outside operator wells, we know we are leading industry in drilling days and costs. Perhaps, our most significant developments to date are coming through recent completion optimizations. Recall that our first 26 STACK wells have identical completions. We felt early that it was critical to have a large, consistent sample set across our acreage footprint. 
In 2015, we began to optimize completions in both SCOOP and STACK, adjusting different variables to find the optimal well for full field development. Recent variables explore the use of zipper fracs, diverting agents, high concentrations of fluids and proppants and slip water fracs. We're very encouraged by the early performance results from these optimizations. Within a larger sample set in time, we will know the magnitude of the impact on our EURs and rates of return. Stay tuned, we'll have more to share with you in the way of data very soon. 
We recently signed new agreements that will help ensure that we have good markets in the possible differentials for our growing STACK production. As today, our STACK oil is trucked to Cushing, Oklahoma. Under our new agreements, we will begin piping about 1/3 of our STACK production in January of 2016 and by the end of the second quarter, 100% of our STACK oil will be piped into Cushing. We've seen a growing appetite for our STACK barrel, which is a 42- to 45-degree API barrel. We will soon have the ability to batch our oil to ensure the best price. We expect our differential to NYMEX WTI will decrease from about $4.50 per barrel today to about $2.50 per barrel early next year. As you can tell in our remarks today, we are very encouraged with the continuing progress that we're making in the Anadarko Basin. And we'll be happy to discussed additional details during our Q&A. 
So in closing, I'd like to say Newfield is in a very good place today. We didn't arrive here by chance. We took the right steps 12 to 18 months ago and hedged forward oil sales to ensure our cash flow. We upsized and extended our credit facility through 2020, ensuring our liquidity position and eliminating redetermination risk, and we sold $2.5 billion in assets at yesterday's commodity prices. These strategic decisions were timely and help with Newfield in an advantaged position today despite a very challenging microenvironment. We are fortunate that we can provide our shareholders with both volumes and value. Growth in shareholder value creation are not mutually exclusive regardless of where we find ourselves in the inevitable commodity price cycles. Thanks for your investment in our company, and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

We'll have to wait for the mood to shift into development to drill multi-well pilots, and I'm sure we'll test spacing tighter than that once we get there. But right now, we're very encouraged with the results. We'll continue to add to the data set. When we get the acreage footprint, HBP, that's going to be a pretty fantastic place to be. Because we will have all of that spacing and well-performance data before we ever actually get into the development mode, that's a luxury we haven't had in any of the previous plays."

I would expect to see continued improvements, as we said earlier. I think the key to remember is our team starts at time 0 in these plays, not to chase press releases and big IPs, but to design the development well. So we're working on the development well designs today. We want compact, tight, complex fraction networks, and that's really what the focus is. I would take you back, I don't know if we've talked, Dan, but I'm sure you've heard Steve and others and some of the materials we've put out. I love looking at what the team's accomplished in the Williston Basin. And we're drilling and completing 21,000-, 22,000-foot wells there today for $5 million, including facilities. And those wells are virtually identical to the types of wells that we'll be drilling in STACK. So we get to development mode, I wouldn't bet against team Newfield."
