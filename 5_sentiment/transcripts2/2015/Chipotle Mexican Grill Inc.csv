I'm extremely pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.1% and the opening of 60 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. For the full year, we generated revenue of $4.1 billion on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.8% and opening of 192 new restaurants. 
While these results would be strong for a company of any size, I think they are particularly impressive considering how we now have nearly 1,800 restaurants, averaging nearly $2.5 million each. Quite simply, I do not think that we would be able to deliver these results without such compelling and relevant vision. We have made it our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food and we have created an extraordinary food and people culture  in a very strong unit economic model that is allowing us to do that. 
Recently, we've seen strong evidence that our commitment to sourcing sustainably raised ingredients is resonating with many consumers. In January, we decided to spend one of our pork suppliers after a routine audit revealed that they were not following all of our animal welfare protocols. Choosing to suspend this supplier meant that we would not be able to supply our neatest to about 1/3 of our 4 restaurants. 
While we could've chosen to replace this supply with pork from conventionally raised pigs, we decided not to because most conventionally raised pigs are subjected to conditions that we find unacceptable. Conventionally raised pigs are typically raised indoors with no outdoor or access to bedding, and are typically given antibiotics non-therapeutically to stimulate growth and to prevent illness from spending due to harsh, crowded, living conditions. These conventional practices are unacceptable to us and we refuse to serve pork from animals raised in that manner.
Since we made this decision, the majority of the sentiment from our customers has been very supportive in email and Web comments, along with social media posts. Customers are applauding our commitment to our vision, thanking us for standing on principle, commending us for taking action against the inhumane treatment of animals and congratulating us for standing by our business values. We certainly appreciate what we are hearing from our customers and are grateful for their continued loyalty. 
We're also pleased to see this response as it shows that our vision and our commitment to sourcing responsibly raised ingredients, including respecting animal welfare are resonated with people in a very real and powerful way. People care about where their food comes from and how it is raised. And we are proud about the tremendous progress we have made over the years. Last year, we served more than 165 million pounds of responsibly raised meat, more than a 20% increase from 2013. All of our responsibly raised meats come from animals that are raised in more humane ways and without the use of antibiotics or added hormones. Meat from animals raised to these higher welfare standards still accounts for the small percentage of the total meat production in this country, yet we continue to find ways to increase our supply year after year. 
Because meat raised in this way is such a small portion of the overall supply system, we will see disruptions from time to time. These disruptions just reinforced the strength and strengthen our commitment to continue to look for ways to increase the supply that is available to us whether from existing suppliers who can grow with us, exploring additional cuts to add to our supply wealth, enhancing the quality of flavor, we're finding new suppliers that meet our high standards. 
Our commitment to sourcing food that is raised responsibly is not limited to pork, chicken and beef. During the year, we continue our use of no till and organically grown beans and we equipped our 2014 goal of serving 20 million pounds of locally grown produce. In a food system that is so heavily dominated by relatively -- a few large producers, it's extraordinary progress and our teams have encountered and overcome numerous hurdles to reach each of these milestones. I'm certain that we will continue to face challenges in this area, but our commitment remains as strong as ever and we will find ways to keep making progress simple because we believe that serving food from these great ingredients is the right thing to do.
While the customer response to how we handle our pork situation is encouraging, it's not the only sign that more and more people are becoming more curious and more discerning about where their food comes from. For example, our vision is really resonating with teens, millennials and generation X. According to industry research, Chipotle is one of the most popular restaurant chains among teens and has been growing in popularity among this demographics. This report from 2014, ranks Chipotle as the third most popular brand among teens up from #8 in 2013. Gen X consumers were 33% more likely than average to choose Chipotle with millennials, Chipotle was even more popular. With customers in this group, 75% more likely than average to choose Chipotle over other restaurants. 
We believe that our popularity among these younger consumers is tied to our vision and the growing interest in issues related to food and how it is raised. Our own research shows that these issues are clearly becoming more relevant and important when customers choose where they will dine. Based on our ongoing tracking research, 87% of fast casual diners say they prefer to eat foods that are grown locally, up from 70% in 2011. 86 believe ingredients raised or grown in a more responsible way taste better. That's up from 76% in 2011. 73% feel it's important to buy organic for certain food items, up from 61% in 2011 and 69% try to eat meat that has been raised responsibly and that's up 53% in 2011.
From the very first Chipotle restaurant nearly 22 years ago, we have charted our own path for how a restaurant company should be run in every single way. We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants rather than franchise and still grow at a rapid rate, but you can spend more on ingredients not less, still serve high quality food at reasonable prices and have industry-leading margins and returns. That you can build teams of top performers, empower them to deliver high standards while still maintaining an efficient labor model and that you can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well rather than trying to be all things to all people or engaging in the kind of marketing gimmicks that have become the hallmarks of traditional fast food and still continue to attract new customers and profitably grow the business over the long-term. 
We believe this is the new fast food model. But this model is not limited to just burritos and tacos. And as you know, we are in the early stages of developing 2 new concepts: ShopHouse Southeast Asian kitchen and Pizzeria Locale that embrace the principles that have made Chipotle successful over the years. We believe offering these cuisines following the Chipotle model is a great way to offer variety to our customers, elevating the dining experience for pizza and Asian cuisine, just as we have done in Chipotle. And we believe this is a much better way to create additional, compelling shareholder value as compared to the traditional restaurant model of letting the menu with so many items that it's impossible to serve anything that is extraordinary. 
During the quarter, we opened a new ShopHouse in Washington, D.C.'s union station, the ninth ShopHouse so far and in January, we finalized a deal to open the first Pizzeria Locale outside of Denver, this one in Kansas City's Waldo neighborhood. While we are pursuing additional sites for each of these concepts, I will remind you that most of our growth for the foreseeable future will continue to be driven by opening Chipotle restaurants in the United States.
Chipotle has created the new fast food model and it's the underlying principles of that model that continue to drive our financial success. Increasingly, our vision of changing the way people think about and eat fast food is resonating with consumers, many of whom want a better, more responsible alternative to traditional fast food.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our ongoing ability to deliver impressive financial results arises from a special culture that we have built at Chipotle that has led to the development of strong leaders. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and to develop those people to be at their best. Because of this, we were able to do things most of our competitors can't do. For instance, other restaurants rely heavily on automated systems to reduce the amount of training and skill that is necessary to do their work in an effort to simplify training and make operations full proof. On the other hand, at Chipotle, we hire energetic and ambitious people who have a desire to learn classic cooking skills, how to be a successful leader and the business acumen necessary to run a highly successful business. But we ask even more of our people. We asked them to elevate the people around them and we judge all of our leaders based on how positively they do that. By rewarding this behavior, we elevate the dining experience our customers enjoy each time they visit, which leads to excellent operations.
One of their rewards for this kind of enlightened leadership is the rapid promotion of our talented leaders in the positions within the restaurant where they can have a greater effect on more of our crew people. Over 90% of our general managers come from crew positions, so people are really starting to understand the kind of opportunity that awaits them at Chipotle. The extraordinary culture that we've created with the restaurateur program as a cornerstone is one of the areas where we're unique within the restaurant industry. It's one of the key drivers of our business and this culture is growing stronger. 
We have made important investments over the past years or so to further strengthen this culture and our ability to develop restaurateurs at a faster rate and across more restaurants. First, we have reduced the field leadership ratios from a high of around 15 restaurants per field leader just a few years ago to about 8 restaurants per field leader today. Secondly, we created the restaurateur diagnostic and plan tool, which helps our field leaders properly diagnose inadequacies and weaknesses in the culture of each restaurant they supervise. Also, this tool generates a clear and actionable plan, which helps the GM address the underlying causes that are prevented that strong team from becoming a restaurateur. 
The combination of these 2 investments is just now beginning to pay off. While we promoted a similar number of Restaurateurs during the past 2 years, we're currently approaching the largest backlog of GMs ready to be interviewed to become a Restaurateur that we ever had at one-time. This gives me great confidence that 2015 will be a breakout year for us in terms of Restaurateur development, which means that even more of our restaurant will be better than they are today with better throughput, better food and a better overall customer experience. 
I'm confident about this because our Restaurateur show us time and time again that the special cultures they create lead to better restaurants in every way. Better field leadership ratios alone might not accelerate Restaurateur development. Those are development and plan to in place and better ratios that allow our field leaders to dive deep into and better understand each restaurants culture, we feel they're in a position to accelerate the proliferation of this powerful culture quickly into more restaurants. So I'm excited to see the dividends from this combined investment pay off this year and in the coming years.
One of the benefits of having great teams and great cultures is the ability to deliver superior throughput. When done well, throughput isn't simply about moving people through the restaurants as quickly as possible. Instead, it's about outstanding customer service with clear, authentic communication with customers as they efficiently move down our serving line. During the quarter, we continued to make progress in terms of throughput on top of the outstanding throughput we drove in the fourth quarter of 2013. We increased our average peak lunch hour transactions by 3 and out of the average of 5 more transactions during the peak dinner our. We attribute this to our continued emphasis from the 4 pillars and the effectiveness of our auditing of and reporting to our field teams, who get frequency back on how well they're executing these 4 pillars. 
Since beginning the 4 pillars reporting effort, we have seen significant improvement and we recently expanded our reporting to include peak dinner hours in addition to peak lunch hours. With this expenditure, before we continue to get better executing the 4 pillars at both lunch and dinner, which we expect will pay off as we head into our busiest season in just a few months. Finally, I'd like to provide an update on development. During the quarter, we opened 60 new restaurants, bringing our total to 192 restaurants opened during the year, coming in at the higher end of our guided range of 180 to 195. 
Nearly 80% of these new restaurants opened in proven or established markets, while the remainder opened in developing or new markets. This makes allowed us to expand our footprint in markets where we have strong presence and strong teams while also introducing our unique dining experience to customers in new markets. For 2015, we expect to open 190 to 205 new restaurants with a similar distribution between proven, established, developing and new markets and a small number of grocery restaurants as well. Overall, we're seeing more competition for sites given the relative health of the economy, but Chipotle remains a very desirable tenant and so we continue to have success in attaining great real estate locations.
In 2014, our total average development cost including international, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale locations was about $849,000, net of landlord reimbursements. The increase in our development cost this year was driven by opening more freestanding restaurants along with higher cost locations in the Northeast. In improving commercial real estate and construction market has also contributed to the increase in development costs. 
In 2015, we expect our average restaurant development cost to decrease based on opening more traditional end cap and inline restaurants, which are generally easy to build and cost less than the freestanding restaurants. I'm more confident now that we have the right pieces in place, a strong food culture, a strong and empowering people culture and an industry-leading unit economic model to continue on our path to change the way people think about and eat fast food. I know that our success in doing that will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,280444611,753910,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Monty. We're extremely proud of the results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014, as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service while preparing and serving a delicious meal",2158,"Thanks, Monty. We're extremely proud of the results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014, as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service while preparing and serving a delicious meal made from Responsibly Raised ingredients to each and every customer. In the fourth quarter, we compared against 2013's highest quarterly comp at 9.3% and we were delighted to be able to serve many more customers and deliver fourth quarter comp of 16.1% on top of that 9.3% comp in 2013. The 16.1% comp helped drive our total quarterly revenue to $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% and our full year revenue totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 27.8% on our full year comp of 16.8. These increased sales are driven primarily by increased customer visits along with an average check increase of 8.3%. The increase in average check was primarily driven by the menu price increase we took midyear of 6.3% and to a lesser extent by continued growth in catering and improved size. 
We're maintaining our full year 2015 same-store sales guidance in the low to mid single-digit range. While we're bullish about the strong sales trends and the growing consumer awareness and appreciation for our sustainably raised ingredients, in 2015, we will compare against the toughest comps we've ever had as a public company. We expect our comps will be the highest in the first quarter and become more difficult as we begin to lap the menu price increase starting in the second quarter, and then begin to flatten out as we compare to the 19.8% comp in Q3 and a 16.1% in the fourth quarter. As a result of the strong comp, our average sales volume per restaurant that have been opened for at least 12 months is now $2,472,000, the highest we've ever achieved. This average volume along with our industry-leading restaurant level margins help us deliver among the highest restaurant level returns in the industry and nearly doubled a very attractive returns we earned when we first became a public company. 
Our new restaurants also continue to perform exceptionally well opening above our communicated sales range of $1.7 million to $1.8 million. and in fact, we now expect our new restaurants to open in the range of $1.8 million to $1.9 million and grow from this initial opening level. We opened 60 new restaurants in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date openings to 192, which is at the high-end of our guidance range for 2014 and we ended the year with 1,783 restaurants including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S. 9 ShopHouses and 2 Pizzeria Locales. As Monty mentioned earlier, we plan to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015, which we expect will be reasonably level loaded throughout the year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. Restaurant level margins increased in the quarter by 100 basis points to 26.6%. Margins were impacted by strong transaction trends and a menu price increase in the middle of last year. Diluted EPS was $14.13 for the full year of 2014, an increase of 35% over 2013. EPS growth outpaced our sales growth as the higher comps included the menu price increase, allowed us to leverage labor and occupancy lines at the restaurant level. Margins for the year increased 60 basis points to 27.2% in 2014. The full year margin impacting food and underlying food inflation of about 7.5% and because we increased price around midyear, our effective price increase for the full year was only about 3.8%, which did not fully cover all of this food inflation. 
Food cost were 35% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from 2013 and sequentially higher by 70 basis points from the third quarter. While avocado cost declined in the quarter as we shifted away from buying California avocados, that benefit was more than offset by higher beef and dairy costs during the quarter. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2016 due to a continued supply constraints, and avocado prices are expected to be slightly higher in 2015 as increased demand is projected to exceed the higher yields we expect from California and Mexico during the year. We expect dairy prices to come down during Q1 from record highs we achieved and sour cream from late 2014 and remain at normalized levels throughout the remainder of 2015. 
We also expect about a $2 million charge in the first quarter on our, related to the suspension of one of our pork suppliers. As Steve mentioned, the decision to stop serving this pork was driven by our commitment to the principles underlying food and integrity including animal welfare protocols and the response from our loyal customers has been very supportive. So all things considered, we expect our food cost in 2015 to remain at about the 35% level we saw in the fourth quarter as the continued pressure in the prices of beef and avocado will be roughly offset by lower prices for dairy with full year food cost remain in that 35% range. 
We don't have any plans from across the board menu price increase in 2015 since we just increased prices and because we're currently earning at or near record margins and returns. In addition, it's important to us that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers as this is the corridor to our ability to change the way people think about and eat fast food. But had we known early last year that beef prices would continue to rise, we may have increased the price [indiscernible] more than we did. We did increase the price of these 2 items much higher than any other entrée, in an effort to charge a fair going price for our take and. And we expected to see some trade-off from stake and, as a result of the higher relative price, but we saw virtually no trade down. 
The continue drive in beef prices have resulted in the upcharge for these entrees not covering the higher ingredient costs. So we're hoping and considering a targeted price increase later in 2015 on our steak and perhaps Barbara Cola to help cover the rising cost of beef. Because steak and Barbara Cola accounts for less than 1/3 of the entrées we sell, we expect an increase we might consider to have a relatively modest impact on our overall results. But our Food with Integrity mission depends on our ability to charge a fair price for the ingredients we serve and we're not quite doing that with our beef right now. So while we're open to the possibility, we've not made a decision to raise beef prices at this time and we'll keep you updated if and when we decide to do so. 
Labor cost were 22% of sales, 22.2% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from 2013. And for the full year, labor costs were down 100 basis points from 2013. This decrease were mainly due to leveraged from the higher full year comp included in the menu price increase, partially offset by increased wage inflation and higher manager and crew staffing. But Chipotle has always offered a simple streamlined health insurance option to all of our hourly employees. In January 1, 2015, we begun to offer medical coverage that qualifies under the Affordable Care Act to full-time hourly employees that is those employees working 30 or more hours per week and with at least 12 months of service. Over 10,000 hourly employees were eligible for this plan based on service length and actual hours worked, and more than 1,000 employees have enrolled so far. The enrollment number is likely to increase going forward as additional employees will qualify each month as they hit the full-time status and as they hit their 1-year anniversary. And based on the over 1,000 enrolled so far, our estimate of expected -- and the estimate of expected additional enrollees going forward, we expect the additional cost of this health insurance in 2015 to be in the $4 million to $8 million range and all of that will hit our labor line. 
Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter, which is down 80 basis points from 2013 due to leverage from the higher comp in the quarter and slightly lower marketing cost. For the full year, other operating cost were 10.6% or down 20 basis points in 2013. Marketing was 1% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our market expenses dropped sequentially by 30 basis points as our skillfully made advertising campaign and hit for most markets in October. For the full year marketing was 1.4% of sales in 2014 in line with 2013 and we expect it to increase slightly to around 1.5% to 1.6% in 2015. 
G&A was 5.7% in the quarter, 90 basis points lower than 2013 due primarily to the timing of the accrual for our annual brooms program and the increased acceleration of stock compensation expense and at the first 3 quarters of the year, as another one of our officers achieved retiree status. For the full year, G&A was 6.7% or 40 basis points higher than 2013, primarily driven by higher noncash, noneconomic stock comp and from our biennial All Managers' Conference held in September where nearly 3,000 Chipotle employees and suppliers were in attendance. The noncash, noneconomic stock comp expense was $15 million in the quarter and $98 million for the full year, which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to options granted in 2014 being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement, which accelerates the noncash charges. These items accounted for about 50 basis points of the increase in G&A, so without these items, underlying G&A would've been lower for the full year 2014. In 2015, we will hold our biennial Field Leadership Conference in the third quarter and we expect that will cost around $2 million. The competition committee of our board is actively evaluating our executive comp for 2015 and so until that is finalized and approved, we're unable to project and communicate the stock comp expense expected for 2015. Our comp committee expects to finalize the plan in the next week or so and we'll communicate the impact when we're able to.
Our 2014 effective tax rate was 37.6% and this is lower than the rate projected at Q3 because of an adjustment and our state tax rate due to a change in estimate of the usable employer credits and the renewal of the work opportunity and R&D credit in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the renewal is only approved for 2014, so without the state tax adjustment and without the work opportunity in R&D credit, we expect our 2015 tax rate to return to about 39%. If these federal credits are renewed, the effective tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points in 2015. 
During the quarter, we purchased about [ph] $25 million worth of our stock with over 37,500 shares at an average share price of $650. For the year, we purchased about $88 million worth of stock and over 153,000 shares at an average share price of $572. At the end of 2014, we still had about $102 million remaining and our previously announced share buyback program and we're announcing today that our board is authorizing an additional share repurchase program of another $100 million. Overall, since 2008, we've invested more than $700 million to purchase more than 4.2 million shares at an average price of $166 per share. 
Capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursements totaled about $240 million in 2014 primarily related to new restaurants along with continued reinvestment existing restaurant and other company initiatives, including a significant upgrade of our restaurant network infrastructure. For 2015, we anticipate CapEx will be around $220 million, the majority of which related to new restaurant construction. In 2014, we increased our total cash and investments by $362 million to $1,250,000 -- $1,250,000,000 even after the funding -- funded the opening of 192 restaurant and repurchasing $88 million of stock through our share buyback agreements, and we still have no debt on our balance sheet. 
We continue to believe that investing in our high return and new restaurants remains the best use of our cash and we're confident that the growth options we're developing today including ShopHouse, Chipotle and international markets and Pizzeria Locale, will provide value enhancing growth opportunities in the future and in the meantime, we'll continue to invest in our high returning domestic restaurant and we'll opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.

And that at the time, came close to or was in the ballpark of covering our additional ingredient cost for surveying a steak burrito, for example. Well, now it's causes an extra $1 or so to serve steak versus chicken. And so we're actually not covering that upcharge, and so it's that situation that causes us to think that we're subsidizing steak and Barbara cola with other items on the menu and that doesn't make sense to us. So recognizing that kind of shortfall, we're at least considering raising prices on right now our steak and our Barbara cola. We don't expect to do anything before midyear, John. We don't want to have a second increase even though it would be just on a few menu items. We'd rather not do that with any 12-month period. We don't want to double up on price increases. We think in order for us to remain accessible, we want to hold off as long as we can, so we'll look and see, watch what happens to beef prices throughout the next quarter or 2, and then around the middle of the year, we'll decide where it makes sense to go ahead and do some kind of a targeted price increase as I just described. In terms of the impact, John, if we did a $0.30 or $0.04 impact or increase, that would be a roughly a 5% or so increase as the order of magnitude, steak and, since they account for less than 1/3 of our menu, that would be somewhere between maybe 100 to 150 basis points menu price increase across all of our menu. So it's not a huge impact to our overall menu, not a huge impact for our margins, but it just kind of gets our individual margins for the entrées that we serve a little bit more in line."

And so we think there might have been a temporary weather impact during November, now we typically don't ever say that our comp was negatively affected by weather because usually when the weather improves or returns to more normal weather, our customers come back and it kind of makes up for it, so I don't know that there was a net impact of weather during the quarter, but we did see that our comps did dip in November and then rebounded back in December. And then into January so far, we're seeing similar sales and transaction trends not necessarily the same comp, in fact not the same comp because as we move to the first quarter, we're now comparing against a 13 -- I think a 13.3 or 13.4, so obviously that comparison is a tougher comparison, but in terms of just absolute transaction and dollar levels and in January we're seeing similar trends to what we saw in the fourth quarter."

But first of all in terms of raising the menu prices, we just don't put a very high importance on our food cost percent as a percent of sales. What we've always focused more on is what is our overall margin and when we apply that margin to our sales, what is our unit economic return, which these sales and these margins or the investment that we've got, we're talking about a 70% or so return on investment, which is roughly double what other successful change are delivering. And so we don't feel this urge with these margins and these returns to increase price just because our food cost happen to be higher. Frankly, our food cost are going to be 40%, but we generate an 80% return, so our margins would be higher and our returns would be higher. Would that be something that investors would accept? I think the answer would be yes, so our focus is less on individual line items and more on our margins and our returns. The second reason why we're not in a hurry and have never been in a hurry to raise prices is part of our vision is to remain accessible. So it's important that we want to source these high end premium ingredients, sustainably raised ingredients, but we want to be affordable. We want people to feel like they can come to Chipotle as often as they want, once a week, multiple times a week, and so we would rather err on side of being more patient and not rushing to raise prices every time some of our ingredient cost move up, so that as many people as possible can enjoy Chipotle. And I think over time, that strategy has worked well for us. And in terms of the other one, it was on competitor impact. We generally don't see any sustained impact. When we have a competitor open up right next to us, we might see a week, 1 week, maybe 10 days or something where we see sales will drop a little bit. There might be this curiosity where some of our customers may peek in and may grab a meal at another fast casual competitor, but those sales come right back. So we've not ever seen any restaurant open up near us where they've taken sales away from us and any kind of sustained basis."

I mean our people, we feel very good about our people culture. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the ratio of the number of restaurants per field leader is much lower than it's been in, in the last several years and we think that gives us a great opportunity to develop more Restaurateurs and even when we're not developing Restaurateurs, we're developing a lot of our GMs to get much, much closer to that level. So we feel like that our worst run restaurants if you want to call them that are much, much better and they were getting a lot more, they're getting close to that Restaurateur level. So we feel really good about that, but likewise, in talking to our real estate teams, they feel really good about what's out there in the real estate world, granted some of the prices are going up because a lot of other concepts are also expanding and growing more quickly due to a better economy, but also by the same token, Chipotle is a really, really well known name and lenders are trying to get us into their centers because they believe that we provide a real boos to the excitement of their center. And so we find that we're able to get more than our fair share of deals, but on both the people side and on the real estate side, we have very high standards and we want to make sure that we have loads of Restaurateurs and excellent general managers and really good field leaders to open up new restaurants and so we're always watching that carefully and not wanting to overstress the cultural side of what we do. But likewise, on the real estate side, we want to open aggressively, but also in a measured way where we're being careful to make sure that we're selecting great, great real estate and while we are able to go into more secondary sorts of locations than we were say 10, 11, 12, 13 years ago, with much more success, we still want to do that in a balanced way. So yes, we agree we can over time grow faster, but we don't find it super important to rush anything in that regard. What's most important to us is to continue to do a great job in the real estate and a great job with our managers and run terrific restaurants such that the demands for what we're doing continues to outstrip the supply, such that when we open new restaurant, we have this really great success with our new restaurant openings, which I think you heard in Jack's remarks that we're looking at sort of 1.8 million to 1.9 million for those new restaurants openings and are a great return pretty much out-of-the-box, which very quickly catches up over the next few years with these very high average unit volumes that we now have, which are somewhere in the $2.47 million range per restaurant, so by continuing to create demand, we continue to have a huge opportunity out in front of us and that allows us to feel really good about our future and our growth."

But really what's most important for us is to continue to implement the 4 pillars, the throughput because right now, our average restaurant in the country does something about 1/3 of the transactions during lunch as our fastest restaurant in the country does and so the #1 opportunity for us along the main service line is that we can go much, much, much faster and we continue, like I said in my remarks, we have gotten quicker even though the fourth quarter, we're at a pace where with -- while it's as quick as our busiest season, it's close to and faster than our busiest season used to be throughput. But we continue make these throughput gains, but we think that there's so much low hanging fruits still in terms of speeding up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks that adding a second line would be more disruptive to our operation and to the design of our restaurants that wouldn't be helpful to the unit economic model at this point. That being said, we do have to keep in mind in almost all of our restaurants a second-make line that we have historically referred to as the fast line where we can serve catering orders or out-of-store orders, iPhone orders and such that keeps those orders, many of which are larger orders off our main service line. Early in my comments, it's now I mentioned that we have tried the 2-line method. We have a restaurant in France, at, which is a business center right near Paris where we do have -- it works with 1 really long line, but people come and go in 2 directions, so it is 2 service lines with 2 separate areas, 2 separate cash registers and so forth. It works and it works just fine. Like I said, it was just not the strategy we need to implement right now and in that location, we had a situation where we had a lot of additional square feet where we could put that into place without losing our other aspects of the operation. So at this point, we're going to continue to focus on the main service line, implementing the 4 pillars of throughput and driving great throughput so that we can have a nice, tidy, efficient unit economic model."

And so our belief has always been that we have a vision to change food culture, the fast food culture in this country and if we're successful with that, we just believe that we can add lots and lots of value and we've done that. We've done that, I think even more than a lot of people including ourselves thought more possible 8 years ago when we first went public and so we think that our vision is working or it's becoming a reality. People more than ever care about where their food comes from, recognize that Chipotle is offering something that many of the restaurant companies don't or are unable to offer and so we've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price, knowing that the stock price will takes care of itself if we're successful. Then back to the, why not just do kind of an every year thing, it's not linear. Inflation, food inflation is not linear and so we don't think our price increases should be linear and in addition to that, even if you did have regular inflationary pressure, we're constantly investing in our food and so we might have significant investments that we want to make 1 year and in the early days when we were first introducing rates move to our market, that would dictate the timing of when we would go ahead and raise prices. And so we don't think that the way our cost either because of food integrity or because of inflation is ever going to be kind of a linear 1% to 2% or 3% per year and so we don't think the pricing should be linear as well, so that would be the way I would describe it."

The reason that we believe development cost are going to come down is, one thing is just in 2014, we had an unusually high number of free standards. Sometimes we sort of take what we can get, that's not necessarily a result of a strategic objective to open more of them. We just happen to find more of them in 2014 that met our screens and look like exciting pieces of real estate that we should build Chipotle restaurants in. In 2015, it's looking like that a lot more of our mix is going to the end cap locations, which tend to do wondrously well, but also tend to cost less to build. More of our bread-and-butter, you might say. So also we think we can get development cost down because we're working very hard from a design standpoint to implement some of our new better design methodologies, but to do it in a more efficient way and to gain some economies of scale in what we're doing. So we're approaching the development cost puzzle from a number of different directions, but strategically, we're not trying to eliminate free standards, we just understand that the end cap locations, we do very, very well with them and in 2015, it looks like more of the pipeline is comprised of them than it was in 2015 -- I mean 2014."

Yes, that would be for the first -- into January, for the first -- the next 4.5 weeks or so into the quarter, similar sales",481,"Yes, first of all on the sequential trends, I think the answer is yes, but let me clarify so that we're talking the same language. Yes, that would be for the first -- into January, for the first -- the next 4.5 weeks or so into the quarter, similar sales and similar transaction seasonally adjusted that we saw in the fourth quarter, that would be at a higher level than last year, so when you say flat, yes, flat sequentially, but not flat compared to last year. In terms of higher throughput, higher throughput really comes into play more so as we move into the spring months. This is seasonally our lower average daily sales period and so throughput is important throughout the year, but it becomes even more important as the weather gets nicer, as more and more people are out and about. Our lines tend to get a little bit longer and if our throughput is excellent at that time, volumes actually won't get longer and so people will walk into Chipotle, be served quickly and so that's what we expect to see a benefit. In essence, Karen, for us to change that trend line, we're going to have to invite more customers in, have faster throughput as I mentioned as we hit more of our seasonally higher sales month and hopefully, we will see a trend change. Very often, we do see a trend change or 2 or 3 during the year. We just haven't happen to see one as we've moved just a few weeks from the fourth quarter and into January so far. And then in terms of the impact on the customer, Chipotle has never really seen a lot of sensitivity in terms of when customers -- when the recession first hit. We weren't the first -- exactly we're one of the last ones to see the impact on our sales and when the recession was ending and we were coming out of the recession, we were the first ones to see a sales increase and we returned to double-digit comps pretty quickly as the recession was ending. And so generally, our customers come to Chipotle, sure, they say its great value when you do research, our customers give us very, very high scores on the great value, but we have very loyal customer such that they don't stop coming to Chipotle when they have a few less hours in their pockets, and then all of a sudden say, I'm going to start going to Chipotle more often because I have a few more dollars. I think the good news here is that people find ways to visit Chipotle and it's not much really affected by whether they've got a few extra bucks in their pocket. Our customer loyalty kind of overcomes these what I would call relatively minor changes in our customers spending ability."

And yet we've had the highest comps I think in the history of the restaurant business during that time. And likewise, we keep trying to improve the quality of our culture, so we have better people serving you. We've been increasing, improving the quality of average raw ingredient, every ingredient we have has been under our scrutiny in order to measure the food tastes as good as it can taste, and we work on throughput to make sure that, that aspect of the customer experience also improves and what we me find is that by focusing on those things that we do really, really well, but yet getting even better at them, we've been able to sustain a much stronger comp than any other restaurant company has done, so while we may look like we're staring down the -- sort of flattening sales and no increased comps, it looked that way 10 years ago, and 9 years ago and 8 years ago and 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 years ago, and I think even a year ago, if you look at what our guidance was for the year, I believe at the very beginning of 2014, we said there would be a low single-digit comp. I think they're flat to low single-digit comp and that looked like what it was going to be at the time. How do we get to a mid-teen, mid to high teen comp? Doing that which we do even better and so it is possible of course, that our comp will flatten out and there won't be a sequential trend changes to the positive, but we hope that our continued focus on trying to do everything we do better will work out just super."

We're aware of it, our teams are aware of it. And so I wouldn't see additional inefficiencies creep in and at some point in the future, I just wouldn't want to pinpoint when.

I'm extremely pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.1% and the opening of 60 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. For the full year, we generated revenue of $4.1 billion on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.8% and the opening of 192 new restaurants. 
While these results would be strong for a company of any size, I think they are particularly impressive considering how we now have nearly 1,800 restaurants, averaging nearly $2.5 million each. Quite simply, I do not think that we would be able to deliver these results without such compelling and relevant vision. We have made it our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food and we have created an extraordinary food and people culture and a very strong unit economic model that is allowing us to do that. 
Recently, we've seen strong evidence that our commitment to sourcing sustainably raised ingredients is resonating with many consumers. In January, we decided to suspend one of our pork suppliers after a routine audit revealed that they were not following all of our animal welfare protocols. Choosing to suspend this supplier meant that we would not be able to supply carnitas to about 1/3 of our restaurants. 
While we could've chosen to replace this supply with pork from conventionally raised pigs, we decided not to because most conventionally raised pigs are subjected to conditions that we find unacceptable. Conventionally raised pigs are typically raised indoors with no outdoor or access to bedding, and are typically given antibiotics non-therapeutically to stimulate growth and to prevent illness from spreading due to harsh, crowded living conditions. These conventional practices are unacceptable to us and we refuse to serve pork from animals raised in that manner.
Since we made this decision, the majority of sentiment from our customers has been very supportive in email and Web comments, along with social media posts. Customers are applauding our commitment to our vision, thanking us for standing on principle, commending us for taking action against the inhumane treatment of animals and congratulating us for standing by our business values. We certainly appreciate what we are hearing from our customers and are grateful for their continued loyalty. 
We're also pleased to see this response as it shows that our vision and our commitment to sourcing responsibly raised ingredients, including respecting animal welfare, are resonated with people in a very real and powerful way. People care about where their food comes from and how it is raised. And we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made over the years. Last year, we served more than 165 million pounds of responsibly raised meat, more than a 20% increase from 2013. All of our responsibly raised meats come from animals that are raised in more humane ways and without the use of antibiotics or added hormones. Meat from animals raised to these higher welfare standards still accounts for a small percentage of the total meat production in this country, yet we continue to find ways to increase our supply year after year. 
Because meat raised in this way is such a small portion of the overall supply system, we will see disruptions from time to time. But these disruptions just reinforce the strength and strengthen our commitment to continue to look for ways to increase the supply that is available to us, whether from existing suppliers who can grow with us, exploring additional cuts to add to our supply wealth, enhancing the quality and flavor, we're finding new suppliers that meet our high standards. 
Our commitment to sourcing food that is raised responsibly is not limited to pork, chicken and beef. During the year, we continue our use of no till and organically grown beans and we equipped our 2014 goal of serving 20 million pounds of locally grown produce. In a food system that is so heavily dominated by relatively a few large producers, it's extraordinary progress and our teams have encountered and overcome numerous hurdles to reach each of these milestones. I'm certain that we will continue to face challenges in this area, but our commitment remains as strong as ever and we will find ways to keep making progress simply because we believe that serving food from these great ingredients is the right thing to do.
While the customer response to how we handle our pork situation is encouraging, it's not the only sign that more and more people are becoming more curious and more discerning about where their food comes from. For example, our vision is really resonating with teens, millennials and generation X. According to industry research, Chipotle is one of the most popular restaurant chains among teens and has been growing in popularity among this demographic. This report from 2014 ranks Chipotle as the third most popular brand among teens, up from #8 in 2013. Gen X consumers were 33% more likely than average to choose Chipotle. With millennials, Chipotle was even more popular, with customers in this group 75% more likely than average to choose Chipotle over other restaurants. 
We believe that our popularity among these younger consumers is tied to our vision and the growing interest in issues related to food and how it is raised. Our own research shows that these issues are clearly becoming more relevant and important when customers choose where they will dine. Based on our ongoing tracking research, 87% of fast casual diners say they prefer to eat foods that are grown locally, up from 70% in 2011. 86% believe ingredients raised or grown in a more responsible way taste better, that's up from 76% in 2011. 73% feel it's important to buy organic for certain food items, up from 61% in 2011. And 69% try to eat meat that has been raised responsibly and that's up 53% in 2011.
From the very first Chipotle restaurant nearly 22 years ago, we have chartered our own path for how a restaurant company should be run in every single way. We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants rather than franchise and still grow at a rapid rate, that you can spend more on ingredients, not less, still serve high-quality food at reasonable prices and have industry-leading margins and returns. That you can build teams of top performers, empower them to deliver high standards while still maintaining an efficient labor model. And that you can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well rather than trying to be all things to all people or engaging in the kind of marketing gimmicks that have become the hallmarks of traditional fast food and still continue to attract new customers and profitably grow the business over the long-term. 
We believe this is the new fast food model. But this model is not limited to just burritos and tacos. And as you know, we are in the early stages of developing 2 new concepts: ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale, that embrace the principles that have made Chipotle successful over the years. We believe offering these cuisines following the Chipotle model is a great way to offer variety to our customers, elevating the dining experience for pizza and Asian cuisine, just as we have done in Chipotle. And we believe this is a much better way to create additional, compelling shareholder value as compared to the traditional restaurant model of letting the menu with so many items that it's impossible to serve anything that is extraordinary. 
During the quarter, we opened a new ShopHouse in Washington, D.C.'s union station, the ninth ShopHouse so far. And in January, we finalized a deal to open the first Pizzeria Locale outside of Denver, this one in Kansas City's Waldo neighborhood. While we are pursuing additional sites for each of these concepts, I will remind you that most of our growth for the foreseeable future will continue to be driven by opening Chipotle restaurants in the United States.
Chipotle has created the new fast food model and it's the underlying principles of that model that continue to drive our financial success. Increasingly, our vision of changing the way people think about and eat fast food is resonating with consumers, many of whom want a better, more responsible alternative to traditional fast food.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our ongoing ability to deliver impressive financial results arises from a special culture that we have built at Chipotle that has led to the development of strong leaders. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and to develop those people to be at their best. Because of this, we were able to do things most of our competitors can't do. For instance, other restaurants rely heavily on automated systems to reduce the amount of training and skill that is necessary to do their work in an effort to simplify training and make operations foolproof. On the other hand, at Chipotle, we hire energetic and ambitious people who have a desire to learn classic cooking skills, how to be a successful leader and the business acumen necessary to run a highly successful business. But we ask even more of our people. We ask them to elevate the people around them and we judge all of our leaders based on how positively they do that. By rewarding this behavior, we elevate the dining experience our customers enjoy each time they visit, which leads to excellent operations.
One of the rewards of this kind of enlightened leadership is the rapid promotion of our talented leaders in the positions within the restaurant where they can have a greater effect on more of our crew people. Over 90% of our general managers come from crew positions, so people are really starting to understand the kind of opportunity that awaits them at Chipotle. The extraordinary culture that we've created with the restaurateur program as a cornerstone is one of the areas where we are unique within the restaurant industry. It's one of the key drivers of our business and this culture is growing stronger. 
We have made important investments over the past year or so to further strengthen this culture and our ability to develop restaurateurs at a faster rate and across more restaurants. First, we have reduced the field leadership ratios from a high of around 15 restaurants per field leader just a few years ago to about 8 restaurants per field leader today. Secondly, we created the restaurateur diagnostic and plan tool, which helps our field leaders properly diagnose inadequacies and weaknesses in the culture of each restaurant they supervise. Also, this tool generates a clear and actionable plan, which helps the GM address the underlying causes that are preventing that restaurant team from becoming a restaurateur. 
The combination of these 2 investments is just now beginning to pay off. While we promoted a similar number of restaurateurs during the past 2 years, we're currently approaching the largest backlog of GMs ready to be interviewed to become a restaurateur that we've ever had at one time. This gives me great confidence that 2015 will be a breakout year for us in terms of restaurateur development, which means that even more of our restaurants will be better than they are today with better throughput, better food and a better overall customer experience. 
I'm confident about this because our restaurateurs show us time and time again that the special cultures they create lead to better restaurants in every way. Better field leadership ratios alone might not accelerate restaurateur development, but with the development and plan tool in place and better ratios that allow our field leaders to dive deep into and better understand each restaurant's culture, we feel that we're in a position to accelerate the proliferation of this powerful culture quickly into more restaurants. So I'm excited to see the dividends from this combined investment pay off this year and in the coming years.
One of the benefits of having great teams and great cultures is the ability to deliver superior throughput. When done well, throughput isn't simply about moving people through the restaurant as quickly as possible, instead, it's about outstanding customer service with clear, authentic communication with customers as they efficiently move down our serving line. During the quarter, we continued to make progress in terms of throughput on top of the outstanding throughput we drove in the fourth quarter of 2013. We increased our average peak lunch hour transactions by 3 and out of the average of 5 more transactions during the peak dinner hour. We attribute this to our continued emphasis from the 4 pillars and the effectiveness of our auditing of and reporting to our field teams, who get frequent feedback on how well they're executing these 4 pillars. 
Since beginning the 4 pillars reporting effort, we have seen significant improvement and we recently expanded our reporting to include peak dinner hours in addition to peak lunch hours. With this expanded reporting, we continue to get better at executing the 4 pillars at both lunch and dinner, which we expect will pay off as we head into our busiest season in just a few months. 
Finally, I'd like to provide an update on development. During the quarter, we opened 60 new restaurants, bringing our total to 192 restaurants opened during the year, coming in at the higher end of our guided range of 180 to 195. 
Nearly 80% of these new restaurants opened in proven or established markets, while the remainder opened in developing or new markets. This mix allowed us to expand our footprint in markets where we have strong presence and strong teams while also introducing our unique dining experience to customers in new markets. 
For 2015, we expect to open 190 to 205 new restaurants with a similar distribution between proven, established, developing and new markets and a small number of real estate restaurants as well. Overall, we're seeing more competition for sites given the relative health of the economy, but Chipotle remains a very desirable tenant and so we continue to have success in obtain great real estate locations.
In 2014, our total average development cost including international, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale locations was about $849,000, net of landlord reimbursements. The increase in our development cost this year was driven by opening more freestanding restaurants, along with higher cost locations in the Northeast. An improving commercial real estate and construction market has also contributed to the increase in development costs. 
In 2015, we expect our average restaurant development cost to decrease based on opening more traditional end cap and inline restaurants, which are generally easier to build and cost less than the freestanding restaurants. I'm more confident than ever that we have the right pieces in place, a strong food culture, a strong and empowering people culture and an industry-leading unit economic model to continue on our path to change the way people think about and eat fast food. I know that our success in doing that will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders.

We're extremely proud of the results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014, as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service while preparing and serving a delicious meal",2157,"Thanks, Monty. We're extremely proud of the results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014, as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service while preparing and serving a delicious meal made from responsibly raised ingredients to each and every customer. 
In the fourth quarter, we compared against 2013's highest quarterly comp at 9.3% and we were delighted to be able to serve many more customers and deliver a fourth quarter comp of 16.1% on top of that 9.3% comp in 2013. The 16.1% comp helped drive our total quarterly revenue to $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% and our full year revenue totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 27.8% on a full year comp of 16.8%. These increased sales are driven primarily by increased customer visits along with an average check increase of 8.3%. The increase in average check was primarily driven by the menu price increase we took midyear of 6.3%, and to a lesser extent, by continued growth in catering and in group size. 
We're maintaining our full year 2015 same-store sales guidance in the low to mid-single-digit range. While we're bullish about the strong sales trends and the growing consumer awareness and appreciation for our sustainably raised ingredients, in 2015, we will compare against the toughest comps we've ever had as a public company. We expect our comps will be the highest in the first quarter and then become more difficult as we begin to lap the menu price increase starting in the second quarter, and then begin to flatten out as we compare it to the 19.8% comp in Q3, and a 16.1% in the fourth quarter. As a result of the strong comp, our average sales volume per restaurants that have been opened for at least 12 months is now $2,472,000, the highest we've ever achieved. This average volume along with our industry-leading restaurant level margins helped us deliver among the highest restaurant level returns in the industry and nearly doubled the very attractive returns we earned when we first became a public company. 
Our new restaurants also continue to perform exceptionally well, opening above our communicated sales range of $1.7 million to $1.8 million. And in fact, we now expect our new restaurants to open in the range of $1.8 million to $1.9 million, and grow from this initial opening level. We opened 60 new restaurants in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date openings to 192, which is at the high end of our guidance range for 2014, and we ended the year with 1,783 restaurants, including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S., 9 ShopHouses and 2 Pizzeria Locales. 
As Monty mentioned earlier, we plan to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015, which we expect will be reasonably level-loaded throughout the year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. Restaurant-level margins increased in the quarter by 100 basis points to 26.6%. Margins were impacted by strong transaction trends and a menu price increase from the middle of last year. Diluted EPS was $14.13 for the full year of 2014, an increase of 35% over 2013. EPS growth outpaced our sales growth as the higher comps, including the menu price increase, allowed us to leverage labor and occupancy lines at the restaurant level. Margins for the year increased 60 basis points to 27.2% in 2014. The full year margin impact included underlying food inflation of about 7.5%, and because we increased price around midyear, our effective price increase for the full year was only about 3.8%, which did not fully cover all of this food inflation. 
Food cost were 35% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from 2013 and sequentially higher by 70 basis points from the third quarter. While avocado cost declined in the quarter as we shifted away from buying California avocados, that benefit was more than offset by higher beef and dairy costs during the quarter. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2016 due to continued supply constraints, and avocado prices are expected to be slightly higher in 2015 as increased demand is projected to exceed the higher yields we expect from California and Mexico during the year. We expect dairy prices to come down during Q1 from record highs we achieved in sour cream from late 2014 and remain at normalized levels throughout the remainder of 2015. 
We also expect about a $2 million charge in the first quarter on our food line related to the suspension of one of our pork suppliers. As Steve mentioned, the decision to stop serving this pork was driven by our commitment to the principles underlying food with integrity including animal welfare protocols, and the response from our loyal customers has been very supportive. So all things considered, we expect our food cost in 2015 to remain at about the 35% level we saw in the fourth quarter, as the continued pressure in the prices of beef and avocado will be roughly offset by lower prices for dairy, with full year food cost remain in that 35% range. 
We don't have any plans for an across-the-board menu price increase in 2015 since we just increased prices and because we're currently earning at or near record margins and returns. In addition, it's important to us that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers as this is the core to our ability to change the way people think about and eat fast food. But had we known early last year that beef prices would continue to rise, we may have increased the prices for our steak and barbacoa more than we did. We did increase the price for these 2 items much higher than any other entrée in an effort to charge a fair going price for our steak and barbacoa. And we expected to see some tradeoff from stake and barbacoa as a result of the higher relative price, but we saw virtually no trade down. 
The continued rise in beef prices has resulted in the upcharge for these entrees not covering the higher ingredient costs. So we're hoping and considering a targeted price increase later in 2015 on our steak and perhaps barbacoa to help cover the rising cost of beef. Because steak and barbacoa accounts for less than 1/3 of the entrées we sell, we expect any increase we might consider to have a relatively modest impact on our overall results. But our food with integrity mission depends on our ability to charge a fair price for the ingredients we serve and we're not quite doing that with our beef right now. So while we're open to the possibility, we've not made a decision to raise beef prices at this time and we'll keep you updated if and when we decide to do so. 
Labor cost were 22% of sales -- 22.2% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from 2013. And for the full year, labor costs were down 100 basis points from 2013. These decreases were mainly due to leverage from the higher full year comp including the menu price increase, partially offset by increased wage inflation and higher manager and crew staffing. 
But Chipotle has always offered a simple streamlined health insurance option to all of our hourly employees. On January 1, 2015, we began to offer medical coverage that qualifies under the Affordable Care Act to full-time hourly employees, that is those employees working 30 or more hours per week and with at least 12 months of service. Over 10,000 hourly employees were eligible for this plan based on service length and actual hours worked, and more than 1,000 employees have enrolled so far. The enrollment number is likely to increase going forward as additional employees will qualify each month as they hit the full-time status and as they hit their 1-year anniversary. And based on the over 1,000 enrolled so far, our estimate of expected -- and the estimate of expected additional enrollees going forward, we expect the additional cost of this health insurance in 2015 to be in the $4 million to $8 million range, and all of that will hit our labor line. 
Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter, which is down 80 basis points from 2013 due to leverage from the higher comp in the quarter and slightly lower marketing cost. For the full year, other operating costs were 10.6% or down 20 basis points from 2013. Marketing was 1% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our marketing expenses dropped sequentially by 30 basis points as our Skillfully Made advertising campaign ended for most markets in October. For the full year, marketing was 1.4% of sales in 2014, in line with 2013, and we expect it to increase slightly to around 1.5% to 1.6% in 2015. 
G&A was 5.7% in the quarter or 90 basis points lower than 2013, due primarily to the timing of the accrual for our annual bonus program and the increased acceleration of stock compensation expense into the first 3 quarters of the year, as another one of our officers achieved retiree status. For the full year, G&A was 6.7% or 40 basis points higher than 2013, primarily driven by higher noncash, noneconomic stock comp and from our biennial All Managers' Conference held in September where nearly 3,000 Chipotle employees and suppliers were in attendance. The noncash, noneconomic stock comp expense was $15 million in the quarter and $98 million for the full year, which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to options granted in 2014 being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement, which accelerates the noncash charges. These items accounted for about 50 basis points of the increase in G&A, so without these items, underlying G&A would've been lower for the full year 2014. 
In 2015, we will hold our biennial Field Leadership Conference in the third quarter and we expect that will cost around $2 million. 
The compensation committee of our board is actively evaluating our executive comp for 2015, and so until that is finalized and approved, we're unable to project and communicate the stock comp expense expected for 2015. Our comp committee expects to finalize the plan in the next week or so and we'll communicate the impact when we're able to.
Our 2014 effective tax rate was 37.6% and this is lower than the rate projected at Q3 because of an adjustment in our state tax rate due to a change in estimate of usable employer credits and the renewal of the work opportunity and R&D credit in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the renewal was only approved for 2014, so without the state tax adjustment and without the work opportunity and R&D credit, we expect our 2015 tax rate to return to about 39%. If these federal credits are renewed, the effective tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points in 2015. 
During the quarter, we purchased about $25 million worth of our stock or over 37,500 shares at an average share price of $650. For the year, we purchased about $88 million worth of stock and over 153,000 shares at an average share price of $572. At the end of 2014, we still had about $102 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback program and we're announcing today that our board is authorizing an additional share repurchase program of another $100 million. Overall, since 2008, we've invested more than $700 million to purchase more than 4.2 million shares at an average price of $166 per share. 
Capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursements totaled about $240 million in 2014, primarily related to new restaurants, along with continued reinvestment in existing restaurant and other company initiatives, including a significant upgrade of our restaurant network infrastructure. For 2015, we anticipate CapEx will be around $220 million, the majority of which relates to new restaurant construction. In 2014, we increased our total cash and investments by $362 million to $1,250,000 -- $1,250,000,000, even after the funding -- funding the opening of 192 restaurant and repurchasing $88 million of stock through our share buyback agreements, and we still have no debt on our balance sheet. 
We continue to believe that investing in our high-returning new restaurants remains the best use of our cash and we're confident that the growth options we're developing today, including ShopHouse, Chipotle and international markets and Pizzeria Locale, will provide value-enhancing growth opportunities in the future. And in the meantime, we'll continue to invest in our high-returning domestic restaurants and we'll opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. 
Thanks for your time today. And at this time, we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines."

Historically, we've had about a $0.30 or $0.35 upcharge for that and we doubled that to about $0.70. And that, at the time, came close to or was in the ballpark of covering our additional ingredient cost for serving a steak burrito, for example. Well, now, it cost us an extra $1 or so to serve steak versus chicken. And so we're actually not covering that upcharge. And so it's that situation that causes us to think that we're subsidizing steak and barbacoa with other items on the menu and that doesn't make sense to us. So recognizing that kind of shortfall, we're at least considering raising prices on, right now, our steak and our barbacoa. We don't expect to do anything before midyear, John. We don't want to have a second increase even though it would be just on a few menu items. We'd rather not do that within a 12-month period. We don't want to double up on price increases. We think, in order for us to remain accessible, we want to hold off as long as we can. So we'll look and see, watch what happens to beef prices throughout the next quarter or 2. And then, around the middle of the year, we'll decide whether it makes sense to go ahead and do some kind of a targeted price increase, as I just described. In terms of the impact, John, if we did a $0.30 or $0.40 impact or increase, that would be roughly a 5% or so increase. As the order of magnitude, steak and barbacoa, since they account for less than 1/3 of our menu, that would be somewhere between maybe 100 to 150 basis point menu price increase across all of our menu. So it's not a huge impact to our overall menu, not a huge impact to our margins, but it just kind of gets our individual margins for the entrées that we serve a little bit more in line."

Yes, David, during the quarter, sales were lower -- our comps were lower in November than they were in the other 2 months. And as we look back at the quarter and as we look back, our sales trends during November, weather was called through much of November, and I think, a lot of restaurant companies all saw the same thing. And so we think there might have been a temporary weather impact during November. Now we typically don't ever say that our comp was negatively affected by weather because, usually, when the weather improves or returns to more normal weather, our customers come back and it kind of makes up for it, so I don't know that there was a net impact of weather during the quarter, but we did see that our comps did dip in November and then rebounded back in December. And then, into January so far, we're seeing similar sales and transaction trends, not necessarily the same comp. In fact, not the same comp because as we move to the first quarter, we're now comparing against a 13 -- I think, a 13.3 or 13.4. So obviously, that comparison is a tougher comparison, but in terms of just absolute transaction and dollar levels in January, we're seeing similar trends to what we saw in the fourth quarter."

And even secondly, just to expect kind of what might be a new economic reality that pricing in general was going up across the economy, whether because of commodities, because of labor, what have you. And if we can just kind of touch on the point that Steve made in his prepared remarks, I think, there's a comment about the number of Chipotle imitators that were kind of coming into the marketplace. You're seeing any kind of competitive impact whatsoever on a local basis. I mean, we certainly can't see it on a international basis in your comps that are giving you at least somewhat of a hesitation of the amount of pricing that the concept can handle."

First of all, in terms of raising menu prices, we just don't put a very high importance on our food cost percent as a percent of sales. What we've always focused more on is what is our overall margin, and when we apply that margin to our sales, what is our unit economic return, which at these sales and these margins, or with the investment that we've got, we're talking about a 70% or so return on investment, which is roughly double what other successful chains are delivering. And so we don't feel this urge with these margins and these returns to increase prices just because our food cost happen to be higher. If I told you our food cost were going to be 40%, but we generate an 80% return, so our margins would be higher and our returns would be higher, would that be something that investors would accept? And I think the answer would be yes. And so our focus is less on individual line items and more on our margins and our returns. The second reason why we're not in a hurry and have never been in a hurry to raise prices is part of our vision is to remain accessible. So it's important that we go out and source these high-end premium ingredients, sustainably raised ingredients, but we want to be affordable. We want people to feel like they can come to Chipotle as often as they want, once a week, multiple times a week, and so we would rather air on side of being more patient and not rushing to raise prices every time some of our ingredient costs move up, so that as many people as possible can enjoy Chipotle. And I think, over time, that strategy has worked well for us. And in terms of the other one, it was on competitor impact. We generally don't see any sustained impact. When we have a competitor open up right next to us, we might see a week, 1 week, maybe 10 days or something where we see sales will drop a little bit. There might be this curiosity where some of our customers may peek in and may grab a meal at another fast casual competitor, but those sales come right back. So we've not ever seen any restaurant open up near us where they've taken sales away from us on any kind of sustained basis."

I mean, I guess, I wouldn't say that real estate or people, I wouldn't really pick one of them as being the greater obstacle right now to continued growth. I mean, our people, we feel very good about our people culture. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the ratio of the number of restaurants per field leader is much lower than it's been in the last several years and we think that gives us a great opportunity to develop more restaurateurs. And even when we're not developing Restaurateurs, we're developing a lot of our GMs to get much, much closer to that level. So we feel like that our worst-run restaurants, if you want to call them that, are much, much better and that we're getting a lot more that they're getting close to that restaurateur level. So we feel really good about that. But likewise, in talking to our real estate teams, they feel really good about what's out there in the real estate world, granted some of the prices are going up because a lot of other concepts are also expanding and growing more quickly due to a better economy. But also by the same token, Chipotle is a really, really well-known name and landlords are excited to get us into their centers because they believe that we provide a real boost to the excitement of their center. And so we find that we're able to get more than our fair share of deals, but on both the people side and on the real estate side, we have very high standards and we want to make sure that we have loads of restaurateurs and excellent general managers and really good field leaders to open up new restaurants and so we're always watching that carefully and not wanting to overstress the cultural side of what we do. But likewise, on the real estate side, we want to open aggressively, but also in a measured way where we're being careful to make sure that we're selecting great, great real estate. And while we are able to go into more secondary sorts of locations than we were, say, 10, 11, 12, 13 years ago with much more success, we still want to do that in a balanced way. So yes, we agree we can, over time, grow faster, but we don't find it super important to rush anything in that regard. What's most important to us is to continue to do a great job with our real estate and a great job with our managers and run terrific restaurants such that the demand for what we're doing continues to outstrip the supply, such that when we open new restaurants, we have this really great success with our new restaurant openings, which, I think, you heard in Jack's remarks that now we're looking at sort of 1.8 million to 1.9 million for those new restaurant openings and a great return pretty much out of the box, which very quickly catches up over the next few years with these very high average unit volumes that we now have, which are somewhere in the $2.47 million range per restaurant. So by continuing to create demand, we continue to have a huge opportunity out in front of us and that allows us to feel really good about our future and our growth."

I don't know whether that's ever an option kind of like a double in drive through for a drive-through concept, but the ability to just have a second line, at least during certain hours of the day to really help the throughput, is that an option?"

Jeff, I think the answer is it is an option and it's an idea that has occurred to us and we even experimented with. But really, what's most important for us is to continue to implement the 4 pillars, the throughput, because right now, our average restaurant in the country does something about 1/3 of the transactions during lunch as our fastest restaurant in the country does. And so the #1 opportunity for us along the main service line is that we can go much, much, much faster and we continue, like I said in my remarks, we have gotten quicker even though in the fourth quarter, we're at a pace where with -- while it's as quick as our busiest season, it's close to and faster than our busiest season used to be at throughput. But we continue to make these throughput gains, but we think that there's so much low-hanging fruits still in terms of speeding up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks that adding a second line would be more disruptive to our operation and to the design of our restaurants that it wouldn't be helpful to the unit economic model at this point. That being said, we do have to keep in mind, in almost all of our restaurants, a second make line that we have historically referred to as the fast line where we can serve catering orders or out-of-store orders, iPhone orders and such that keeps those orders, many of which are larger orders, off our main service line. Early in my comments, just now I mentioned that we have tried the 2-line method. We have a restaurant in France, at la Défense, which is a business center right near Paris, where we do have -- it works 1 really long line, but people come in and go in 2 directions, so it is 2 service lines with 2 separate areas, 2 separate cash registers and so forth. It works and it works just fine. Like I said, it was just not the strategy we need to implement right now. And in that location, we had a situation where we had a lot of additional square feet where we could put that into place without losing other aspects of the operation. So at this point, we're going to continue to focus on the main service line, implementing the 4 pillars of throughput and driving great throughput so that we can have a nice, tidy, efficient unit economic model."

And so our belief has always been that we have a vision to change food culture, the fast food culture in this country. And if we're successful with that, we just believe that we can add lots and lots of value and we've done that. We've done that, I think, even maybe more than a lot of people including ourselves thought were possible 8 years ago when we first went public and so we think that our vision is working or it's becoming a reality. People more than ever care about where their food comes from, recognize that Chipotle is offering something that many of the restaurant companies don't or are unable to offer and so we've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price, knowing that the stock price will take care of itself if we're successful. Then back to the, why not just do kind of an every year thing. It's not linear. Inflation, food inflation is not linear and so we don't think our price increases should be linear. And in addition to that, even if you did have regular inflationary pressure, we're constantly investing in our food and so we might have significant investments that we want to make 1 year. And in the early days, when we were first introducing [indiscernible] needs to our market, that would dictate the timing of when we would go ahead and raise prices. And so we don't think that the way our cost, either because of food integrity or because of inflation, is ever going to be kind of a linear 1% to 2% or 3% per year, and so we don't think the pricing should be linear as well, so that would be the way I would describe it."

The reason that we believe development costs are going to come down is, a few full, one thing is that just in 2014, we had an unusually high number of free standards. Sometimes, we sort of take what we can get, that's not necessarily the result of a strategic objective to open more of them. We just happen to find more of them in 2014 that met our screens and look like exciting pieces of real estate that we should build Chipotle restaurants in. In 2015, it's looking like that a lot more of our mix is going to the end cap locations, which tend to do wondrously well, but also tend to cost less to build. More of our bread-and-butter, you might say. So also, we think we can get development cost down because we're working very hard from a design standpoint to implement some of our new better design methodologies, but to do it in a more efficient way and to gain some economies of scale in what we're doing. So we're approaching the development cost puzzle from a number of different directions. But strategically, we're not trying to eliminate free-standers, we just understand that the end cap locations, that we do very, very well with them. And during 2015, it looks like more of the pipeline is comprised of them than it was in 2015 -- I mean, excuse me, 2014."

Yes, that would be for the first -- in the January, for the first -- the next 4.5 weeks or so into the quarter, similar sales, similar transaction seasonally adjusted that we saw in the fourth quarter, that would be at a higher level than last year or so. When you say flat, yes, flat sequentially, but not flat compared to last year. In terms of higher throughput, higher throughput really comes into play more so as we move into the spring months. This is seasonally our lower average daily sales period and so throughput is important throughout the year, but it becomes even more important as the weather gets nicer, as more and more people are out and about. Our lines tend to get a little bit longer. And if our throughput is excellent at that time, volumes actually won't get longer and so people will walk into Chipotle, be served quickly and so that's when we would expect to see a benefit. In essence, Karen, for us to change that trend line, we're going to have to invite more customers in, have faster throughput, as I mentioned, as we hit more of our seasonally higher sales month. And hopefully, we will see a trend change. Very often, we do see a trend change or 2 or 3 during the year. We just haven't happen to see one as we've moved just a few weeks from the fourth quarter and into January so far. And then, in terms of the impact on the customer, Chipotle has never really seen a lot of sensitivity in terms of when customers -- when the recession first hit, we weren't the first, in fact, we were one of the last ones to see any impact on our sales. And when the recession was ending and we were coming out of the recession, we were the first ones to see a sales increase and we returned to double digit comps pretty quickly as the recession was ending. And so generally, our customers come to Chipotle, sure, they say it's great value. When we do research, our customers give us very, very high scores on the great value, but we have very loyal customers such that they don't stop coming to Chipotle when they have a few less dollars in their pockets, and then all of a sudden say, boy, I'm going to start going to Chipotle more often because I got a few more bucks. I think, the good news here is that people find ways to visit Chipotle and it's not necessarily affected by whether they've got a few extra bucks in their pocket. Our customer loyalty kind of overcomes these what I would call relatively minor changes in our customers' spending ability."

During all those 20 years and particularly during the year since we've been public, we've been hearing a crescendo of people wondering why we don't add additional menu items and change other aspects of what we do, and yet we've had the highest comps, I think, in the history of the restaurant business during that time. And likewise, we keep trying to improve the quality of our culture, so we have better people serving you. We've been increasing or improving the quality of our average raw ingredient, every ingredient we have has been under our scrutiny in order to make sure the food tastes as good as it can taste. And we work on throughput to make sure that, that aspect of the customer experience also improves. And what we me find is that by focusing on those things that we do really, really well, but yet getting even better at them, we've been able to sustain a much stronger comp than any other restaurant company has done. So while it may look like we're staring down the pike at sort of flattening sales and no increased comps, it looked that way 10 years ago, and 9 years ago and 8 years ago and 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 years ago, and I think, even a year ago, if you look at what our guidance was for the year, I believe at the very beginning of 2014, we said that there would be a low single digit comp. And I think, they're flat to low single digit comp. And that looked like what it was going to be at the time. How did we get to a mid-teen, mid to high teen comp? Doing that which we do, even better. And so it is possible, of course, that our comp will flatten out and there won't be a sequential trend changes to the positive, but we hope that our continued focus on trying to do everything we do better will work out just super."

I'm extremely pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout 2014.

I'm extremely pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.1% and the opening of 60 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. For the full year, we generated revenue of $4.1 billion on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.8% and the opening of 192 new restaurants. 
While these results would be strong for a company of any size, I think they are particularly impressive considering how we now have nearly 1,800 restaurants, averaging nearly $2.5 million each. Quite simply, I do not think that we would be able to deliver these results without such compelling and relevant vision. We have made it our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food and we have created an extraordinary food and people culture and a very strong unit economic model that is allowing us to do that. 
Recently, we've seen strong evidence that our commitment to sourcing sustainably raised ingredients is resonating with many consumers. In January, we decided to suspend one of our pork suppliers after a routine audit revealed that they were not following all of our animal welfare protocols. Choosing to suspend this supplier meant that we would not be able to supply carnitas to about 1/3 of our restaurants. 
While we could've chosen to replace this supply with pork from conventionally raised pigs, we decided not to because most conventionally raised pigs are subjected to conditions that we find unacceptable. Conventionally raised pigs are typically raised indoors with no outdoor or access to bedding, and are typically given antibiotics non-therapeutically to stimulate growth and to prevent illness from spreading due to harsh, crowded living conditions. These conventional practices are unacceptable to us and we refuse to serve pork from animals raised in that manner.
Since we made this decision, the majority of sentiment from our customers has been very supportive in email and Web comments, along with social media posts. Customers are applauding our commitment to our vision, thanking us for standing on principle, commending us for taking action against the inhumane treatment of animals and congratulating us for standing by our business values. We certainly appreciate what we are hearing from our customers and are grateful for their continued loyalty. 
We're also pleased to see this response as it shows that our vision and our commitment to sourcing responsibly raised ingredients, including respecting animal welfare, are resonated with people in a very real and powerful way. People care about where their food comes from and how it is raised. And we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made over the years. Last year, we served more than 165 million pounds of responsibly raised meat, more than a 20% increase from 2013. All of our responsibly raised meats come from animals that are raised in more humane ways and without the use of antibiotics or added hormones. Meat from animals raised to these higher welfare standards still accounts for a small percentage of the total meat production in this country, yet we continue to find ways to increase our supply year after year. 
Because meat raised in this way is such a small portion of the overall supply system, we will see disruptions from time to time. But these disruptions just reinforce the strength and strengthen our commitment to continue to look for ways to increase the supply that is available to us, whether from existing suppliers who can grow with us, exploring additional cuts to add to our supply wealth, enhancing the quality and flavor, we're finding new suppliers that meet our high standards. 
Our commitment to sourcing food that is raised responsibly is not limited to pork, chicken and beef. During the year, we continue our use of no till and organically grown beans and we eclipsed our 2014 goal of serving 20 million pounds of locally grown produce. In a food system that is so heavily dominated by relatively a few large producers, it's extraordinary progress and our teams have encountered and overcome numerous hurdles to reach each of these milestones. I'm certain that we will continue to face challenges in this area, but our commitment remains as strong as ever and we will find ways to keep making progress simply because we believe that serving food from these great ingredients is the right thing to do.
While the customer response to how we handle our pork situation is encouraging, it's not the only sign that more and more people are becoming more curious and more discerning about where their food comes from. For example, our vision is really resonating with teens, millennials and generation X. According to industry research, Chipotle is one of the most popular restaurant chains among teens and has been growing in popularity among this demographic. This report from 2014 ranks Chipotle as the third most popular brand among teens, up from #8 in 2013. Gen X consumers were 33% more likely than average to choose Chipotle. With millennials, Chipotle was even more popular, with customers in this group 75% more likely than average to choose Chipotle over other restaurants. 
We believe that our popularity among these younger consumers is tied to our vision and the growing interest in issues related to food and how it is raised. Our own research shows that these issues are clearly becoming more relevant and important when customers choose where they will dine. Based on our ongoing tracking research, 87% of fast casual diners say they prefer to eat foods that are grown locally, up from 70% in 2011. 86% believe ingredients raised or grown in a more responsible way taste better, that's up from 76% in 2011. 73% feel it's important to buy organic for certain food items, up from 61% in 2011. And 69% try to eat meat that has been raised responsibly and that's up 53% in 2011.
From the very first Chipotle restaurant nearly 22 years ago, we have chartered our own path for how a restaurant company should be run in every single way. We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants rather than franchise and still grow at a rapid rate, that you can spend more on ingredients, not less, still serve high-quality food at reasonable prices and have industry-leading margins and returns. That you can build teams of top performers, empower them to deliver high standards while still maintaining an efficient labor model. And that you can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well rather than trying to be all things to all people or engaging in the kind of marketing gimmicks that have become the hallmarks of traditional fast food and still continue to attract new customers and profitably grow the business over the long-term. 
We believe this is the new fast food model. But this model is not limited to just burritos and tacos. And as you know, we are in the early stages of developing 2 new concepts: ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale, that embrace the principles that have made Chipotle successful over the years. We believe offering these cuisines following the Chipotle model is a great way to offer variety to our customers, elevating the dining experience for pizza and Asian cuisine, just as we have done in Chipotle. And we believe this is a much better way to create additional, compelling shareholder value as compared to the traditional restaurant model of letting the menu with so many items that it's impossible to serve anything that is extraordinary. 
During the quarter, we opened a new ShopHouse in Washington, D.C.'s union station, the ninth ShopHouse so far. And in January, we finalized a deal to open the first Pizzeria Locale outside of Denver, this one in Kansas City's Waldo neighborhood. While we are pursuing additional sites for each of these concepts, I will remind you that most of our growth for the foreseeable future will continue to be driven by opening Chipotle restaurants in the United States.
Chipotle has created the new fast food model and it's the underlying principles of that model that continue to drive our financial success. Increasingly, our vision of changing the way people think about and eat fast food is resonating with consumers, many of whom want a better, more responsible alternative to traditional fast food.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our ongoing ability to deliver impressive financial results arises from a special culture that we have built at Chipotle that has led to the development of strong leaders. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and to develop those people to be at their best. Because of this, we were able to do things most of our competitors can't do. For instance, other restaurants rely heavily on automated systems to reduce the amount of training and skill that is necessary to do their work in an effort to simplify training and make operations foolproof. On the other hand, at Chipotle, we hire energetic and ambitious people who have a desire to learn classic cooking skills, how to be a successful leader and the business acumen necessary to run a highly successful business. But we ask even more of our people. We ask them to elevate the people around them and we judge all of our leaders based on how positively they do that. By rewarding this behavior, we elevate the dining experience our customers enjoy each time they visit, which leads to excellent operations.
One of the rewards of this kind of enlightened leadership is the rapid promotion of our talented leaders into positions within the restaurant where they can have a greater effect on more of our crew people. Over 90% of our general managers come from crew positions, so people are really starting to understand the kind of opportunity that awaits them at Chipotle. The extraordinary culture that we've created with the restaurateur program as a cornerstone is one of the areas where we are unique within the restaurant industry. It's one of the key drivers of our business and this culture is growing stronger. 
We have made important investments over the past year or so to further strengthen this culture and our ability to develop restaurateurs at a faster rate and across more restaurants. First, we have reduced the field leadership ratios from a high of around 15 restaurants per field leader just a few years ago to about 8 restaurants per field leader today. Secondly, we created the restaurateur diagnostic and plan tool, which helps our field leaders properly diagnose inadequacies and weaknesses in the culture of each restaurant they supervise. Also, this tool generates a clear and actionable plan, which helps the GM address the underlying causes that are preventing that restaurant team from becoming a restaurateur. 
The combination of these 2 investments is just now beginning to pay off. While we promoted a similar number of restaurateurs during the past 2 years, we're currently approaching the largest backlog of GMs ready to be interviewed to become a restaurateur that we've ever had at one time. This gives me great confidence that 2015 will be a breakout year for us in terms of restaurateur development, which means that even more of our restaurants will be better than they are today with better throughput, better food and a better overall customer experience. 
I'm confident about this because our restaurateurs show us time and time again that the special cultures they create lead to better restaurants in every way. Better field leadership ratios alone might not accelerate restaurateur development, but with the development and plan tool in place and better ratios that allow our field leaders to dive deep into and better understand each restaurant's culture, we feel that we're in a position to accelerate the proliferation of this powerful culture quickly into more restaurants. So I'm excited to see the dividends from this combined investment pay off this year and in the coming years.
One of the benefits of having great teams and great cultures is the ability to deliver superior throughput. When done well, throughput isn't simply about moving people through the restaurant as quickly as possible, instead, it's about outstanding customer service with clear, authentic communication with customers as they efficiently move down our serving line. During the quarter, we continued to make progress in terms of throughput on top of the outstanding throughput we drove in the fourth quarter of 2013. We increased our average peak lunch hour transactions by 3 and added an average of 5 more transactions during the peak dinner hour. We attribute this to our continued emphasis from the 4 pillars and the effectiveness of our auditing of and reporting to our field teams, who get frequent feedback on how well they're executing these 4 pillars. 
Since beginning the 4 pillars reporting effort, we have seen significant improvement and we recently expanded our reporting to include peak dinner hours in addition to peak lunch hours. With this expanded reporting, we continue to get better at executing the 4 pillars at both lunch and dinner, which we expect will pay off as we head into our busiest season in just a few months. 
Finally, I'd like to provide an update on development. During the quarter, we opened 60 new restaurants, bringing our total to 192 restaurants opened during the year, coming in at the higher end of our guided range of 180 to 195. 
Nearly 80% of these new restaurants opened in proven or established markets, while the remainder opened in developing or new markets. This mix allowed us to expand our footprint in markets where we have strong presence and strong teams while also introducing our unique dining experience to customers in new markets. 
For 2015, we expect to open 190 to 205 new restaurants with a similar distribution between proven, established, developing and new markets and a small number of real estate restaurants as well. Overall, we're seeing more competition for sites given the relative health of the economy, but Chipotle remains a very desirable tenant and so we continue to have success in obtain great real estate locations.
In 2014, our total average development cost including international, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale locations was about $849,000, net of landlord reimbursements. The increase in our development cost this year was driven by opening more freestanding restaurants, along with higher cost locations in the Northeast. An improving commercial real estate and construction market has also contributed to the increase in development costs. 
In 2015, we expect our average restaurant development cost to decrease based on opening more traditional end cap and inline restaurants, which are generally easier to build and cost less than the freestanding restaurants. I'm more confident than ever that we have the right pieces in place, a strong food culture, a strong and empowering people culture and an industry-leading unit economic model to continue on our path to change the way people think about and eat fast food. I know that our success in doing that will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,280444611,754027,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Monty. We're extremely proud of the results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014, as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service while preparing and serving a delicious meal",2158,"Thanks, Monty. We're extremely proud of the results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014, as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service while preparing and serving a delicious meal made from responsibly raised ingredients to each and every customer. 
In the fourth quarter, we compared against 2013's highest quarterly comp at 9.3% and we were delighted to be able to serve many more customers and deliver a fourth quarter comp of 16.1% on top of that 9.3% comp in 2013. The 16.1% comp helped drive our total quarterly revenue to $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% and our full year revenue totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 27.8% on a full year comp of 16.8%. These increased sales are driven primarily by increased customer visits along with an average check increase of 8.3%. The increase in average check was primarily driven by the menu price increase we took midyear of 6.3%, and to a lesser extent, by continued growth in catering and in group size. 
We're maintaining our full year 2015 same-store sales guidance in the low to mid-single-digit range. While we're bullish about the strong sales trends and the growing consumer awareness and appreciation for our sustainably raised ingredients, in 2015, we will compare against the toughest comps we've ever had as a public company. We expect our comps will be the highest in the first quarter and then become more difficult as we begin to lap the menu price increase starting in the second quarter, and then begin to flatten out as we compare it to the 19.8% comp in Q3, and a 16.1% in the fourth quarter. As a result of the strong comp, our average sales volume per restaurants that have been opened for at least 12 months is now $2,472,000, the highest we've ever achieved. This average volume along with our industry-leading restaurant level margins helped us deliver among the highest restaurant level returns in the industry and nearly doubled the very attractive returns we earned when we first became a public company. 
Our new restaurants also continue to perform exceptionally well, opening above our communicated sales range of $1.7 million to $1.8 million. And in fact, we now expect our new restaurants to open in the range of $1.8 million to $1.9 million, and grow from this initial opening level. We opened 60 new restaurants in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date openings to 192, which is at the high end of our guidance range for 2014, and we ended the year with 1,783 restaurants, including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S., 9 ShopHouses and 2 Pizzeria Locales. 
As Monty mentioned earlier, we plan to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015, which we expect will be reasonably level-loaded throughout the year. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. Restaurant-level margins increased in the quarter by 100 basis points to 26.6%. Margins were impacted by strong transaction trends and a menu price increase from the middle of last year. Diluted EPS was $14.13 for the full year of 2014, an increase of 35% over 2013. EPS growth outpaced our sales growth as the higher comps, including the menu price increase, allowed us to leverage labor and occupancy lines at the restaurant level. Margins for the year increased 60 basis points to 27.2% in 2014. The full year margin impact included underlying food inflation of about 7.5%, and because we increased price around midyear, our effective price increase for the full year was only about 3.8%, which did not fully cover all of this food inflation. 
Food costs were 35% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from 2013 and sequentially higher by 70 basis points from the third quarter. While avocado cost declined in the quarter as we shifted away from buying California avocados, that benefit was more than offset by higher beef and dairy costs during the quarter. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2016 due to continued supply constraints, and avocado prices are expected to be slightly higher in 2015 as increased demand is projected to exceed the higher yields we expect from California and Mexico during the year. We expect dairy prices to come down during Q1 from record highs for our cheese and sour cream from late 2014 and remain at normalized levels throughout the remainder of 2015. 
We also expect about a $2 million charge in the first quarter on our food line related to the suspension of one of our pork suppliers. As Steve mentioned, the decision to stop serving this pork was driven by our commitment to the principles underlying food with integrity including animal welfare protocols, and the response from our loyal customers has been very supportive. So all things considered, we expect our food costs in 2015 to remain at about the 35% level we saw in the fourth quarter, as the continued pressure in the prices of beef and avocado will be roughly offset by lower prices for dairy, with full year food cost remain in that 35% range. 
We don't have any plans for an across-the-board menu price increase in 2015 since we just increased prices and because we're currently earning at or near record margins and returns. In addition, it's important to us that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers as this is the core to our ability to change the way people think about and eat fast food. But had we known early last year that beef prices would continue to rise, we may have increased the prices for our steak and barbacoa more than we did. We did increase the price for these 2 items much higher than any other entrée in an effort to charge the fair going price for our steak and barbacoa. And we expected to see some tradeoff from stake and barbacoa as a result of the higher relative price, but we saw virtually no trade down. 
The continued rise in beef prices has resulted in the upcharge for these entrees not covering the higher ingredient costs. So we're open to considering a targeted price increase later in 2015 on our steak and perhaps barbacoa to help cover the rising cost of beef. Because steak and barbacoa accounts for less than 1/3 of the entrées we sell, we expect any increase we might consider to have a relatively modest impact on our overall results. But our food with integrity mission depends on our ability to charge a fair price for the ingredients we serve and we're not quite doing that with our beef right now. So while we're open to the possibility, we've not made a decision to raise beef prices at this time and we'll keep you updated if and when we decide to do so. 
Labor costs were 22% of sales -- 22.2% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from 2013. And for the full year, labor costs were down 100 basis points from 2013. These decreases were mainly due to leverage from the higher full year comp including the menu price increase, partially offset by increased wage inflation and higher manager and crew staffing. 
But Chipotle has always offered a simple streamlined health insurance option to all of our hourly employees. On January 1, 2015, we began to offer medical coverage that qualifies under the Affordable Care Act to full-time hourly employees, that is those employees working 30 or more hours per week and with at least 12 months of service. Over 10,000 hourly employees were eligible for this plan based on service length and actual hours worked, and more than 1,000 employees have enrolled so far. The enrollment number is likely to increase going forward as additional employees will qualify each month as they hit the full-time status and as they hit their 1-year anniversary. And based on the over 1,000 enrolled so far, our estimate of expected -- and the estimate of expected additional enrollees going forward, we expect the additional cost of this health insurance in 2015 to be in the $4 million to $8 million range, and all of that will hit our labor line. 
Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter, which is down 80 basis points from 2013 due to leverage from the higher comp in the quarter and slightly lower marketing cost. For the full year, other operating costs were 10.6% or down 20 basis points from 2013. Marketing was 1% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our marketing expenses dropped sequentially by 30 basis points as our Skillfully Made advertising campaign ended for most markets in October. For the full year, marketing was 1.4% of sales in 2014, in line with 2013, and we expect it to increase slightly to around 1.5% to 1.6% in 2015. 
G&A was 5.7% in the quarter or 90 basis points lower than 2013, due primarily to the timing of the accrual for our annual bonus program and the increased acceleration of stock compensation expense into the first 3 quarters of the year, as another one of our officers achieved retiree status. For the full year, G&A was 6.7% or 40 basis points higher than 2013, primarily driven by higher noncash, noneconomic stock comp and from our biennial All Managers' Conference held in September where nearly 3,000 Chipotle employees and suppliers were in attendance. The noncash, noneconomic stock comp expense was $15 million in the quarter and $98 million for the full year, which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to options granted in 2014 being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement, which accelerates the noncash charges. These items accounted for about 50 basis points of the increase in G&A, so without these items, underlying G&A would've been lower for the full year 2014. 
In 2015, we will hold our biennial Field Leadership Conference in the third quarter and we expect that will cost around $2 million. 
The compensation committee of our board is actively evaluating our executive comp for 2015, and so until that is finalized and approved, we're unable to project and communicate the stock comp expense expected for 2015. Our comp committee expects to finalize the plan in the next week or so and we'll communicate the impact when we're able to.
Our 2014 effective tax rate was 37.6% and this is lower than the rate projected at Q3 because of an adjustment in our state tax rate due to a change in estimate of usable employer credits and the renewal of the work opportunity and R&D credit in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the renewal was only approved for 2014, so without the state tax adjustment and without the work opportunity and R&D credit, we expect our 2015 tax rate to return to about 39%. If these federal credits are renewed, the effective tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points in 2015. 
During the quarter, we purchased about $25 million worth of our stock or over 37,500 shares at an average share price of $650. For the year, we purchased about $88 million worth of stock and over 153,000 shares at an average share price of $572. At the end of 2014, we still had about $102 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback program and we're announcing today that our board is authorizing an additional share repurchase program of another $100 million. Overall, since 2008, we've invested more than $700 million to purchase more than 4.2 million shares at an average price of $166 per share. 
Capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursements totaled about $240 million in 2014, primarily related to new restaurants, along with continued reinvestment in existing restaurant and other company initiatives, including a significant upgrade of our restaurant network infrastructure. For 2015, we anticipate CapEx will be around $220 million, the majority of which relates to new restaurant construction. In 2014, we increased our total cash and investments by $362 million to $1,250,000 -- $1,250,000,000, even after the funding -- funding the opening of 192 restaurant and repurchasing $88 million of stock through our share buyback agreements, and we still have no debt on our balance sheet. 
We continue to believe that investing in our high-returning new restaurants remains the best use of our cash and we're confident that the growth options we're developing today, including ShopHouse, Chipotle and international markets and Pizzeria Locale, will provide value-enhancing growth opportunities in the future. And in the meantime, we'll continue to invest in our high-returning domestic restaurants and we'll opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. 
Thanks for your time today. And at this time, we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines."

Historically, we've had about a $0.30 or $0.35 upcharge for that and we doubled that to about $0.70. And that, at the time, came close to or was in the ballpark of covering our additional ingredient cost for serving a steak burrito, for example. Well, now, it cost us an extra $1 or so to serve steak versus chicken. And so we're actually not covering that upcharge. And so it's that situation that causes us to think that we're subsidizing steak and barbacoa with other items on the menu and that doesn't make sense to us. So recognizing that kind of shortfall, we're at least considering raising prices on, right now, our steak and our barbacoa. We don't expect to do anything before midyear, John. We don't want to have a second increase even though it would be just on a few menu items. We'd rather not do that within a 12-month period. We don't want to double up on price increases. We think, in order for us to remain accessible, we want to hold off as long as we can. So we'll look and see, watch what happens to beef prices throughout the next quarter or 2. And then, around the middle of the year, we'll decide whether it makes sense to go ahead and do some kind of a targeted price increase, as I just described. In terms of the impact, John, if we did a $0.30 or $0.40 impact or increase, that would be roughly a 5% or so increase. As a order of magnitude, steak and barbacoa, since they account for less than 1/3 of our menu, that would be somewhere between maybe 100 to 150 basis point menu price increase across all of our menu. So it's not a huge impact to our overall menu, not a huge impact to our margins, but it just kind of gets our individual margins for the entrées that we serve a little bit more in line."

Yes, David, during the quarter, sales were lower -- our comps were lower in November than they were in the other 2 months. And as we look back at the quarter and as we look back, our sales trends during November, weather was called through much of November, and I think, a lot of restaurant companies all saw the same thing. And so we think there might have been a temporary weather impact during November. Now we typically don't ever say that our comp was negatively affected by weather because, usually, when the weather improves or returns to more normal weather, our customers come back and it kind of makes up for it, so I don't know that there was a net impact of weather during the quarter, but we did see that our comps did dip in November and then rebounded back in December. And then, into January so far, we're seeing similar sales and transaction trends, not necessarily the same comp. In fact, not the same comp because as we move to the first quarter, we're now comparing against a 13 -- I think, a 13.3 or 13.4. So obviously, that comparison is a tougher comparison, but in terms of just absolute transaction and dollar levels in January, we're seeing similar trends to what we saw in the fourth quarter."

And if we can just kind of touch on the point that Steve made in his prepared remarks, I think, there's a comment about the number of Chipotle imitators that were kind of coming into the marketplace. You're seeing any kind of competitive impact whatsoever on a local basis. I mean, we certainly can't see it on a national basis in your comps that are giving you at least somewhat of a hesitation of the amount of pricing that the concept can handle."

First of all, in terms of raising menu prices, we just don't put a very high importance on our food cost percent as a percent of sales. What we've always focused more on is what is our overall margin, and when we apply that margin to our sales, what is our unit economic return, which at these sales and these margins, or with the investment that we've got, we're talking about a 70% or so return on investment, which is roughly double what other successful chains are delivering. And so we don't feel this urge with these margins and these returns to increase prices just because our food cost happen to be higher. If I told you our food cost were going to be 40%, but we'd generate an 80% return, so our margins would be higher and our returns would be higher, would that be something that investors would accept? And I think the answer would be yes. And so our focus is less on individual line items and more on our margins and our returns. The second reason why we're not in a hurry and have never been in a hurry to raise prices is part of our vision is to remain accessible. So it's important that we go out and source these high-end premium ingredients, sustainably raised ingredients, but we want to be affordable. We want people to feel like they can come to Chipotle as often as they want, once a week, multiple times a week, and so we would rather air on side of being more patient and not rushing to raise prices every time some of our ingredient costs move up, so that as many people as possible can enjoy Chipotle. And I think, over time, that strategy has worked well for us. And in terms of the other one, it was on competitor impact. We generally don't see any sustained impact. When we have a competitor open up right next to us, we might see a week, 1 week, maybe 10 days or something where we see sales will drop a little bit. There might be this curiosity where some of our customers may peek in and may grab a meal at another fast casual competitor, but those sales come right back. So we've not ever seen any restaurant open up near us where they've taken sales away from us on any kind of sustained basis."

I mean, I guess, I wouldn't say that real estate or people, I wouldn't really pick one of them as being the greater obstacle right now to continued growth. I mean, our people, we feel very good about our people culture. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the ratio of the number of restaurants per field leader is much lower than it's been in the last several years and we think that gives us a great opportunity to develop more restaurateurs. And even when we're not developing Restaurateurs, we're developing a lot of our GMs to get much, much closer to that level. So we feel like that our worst-run restaurants, if you want to call them that, are much, much better and that we're getting a lot more that they're getting close to that restaurateur level. So we feel really good about that. But likewise, in talking to our real estate teams, they feel really good about what's out there in the real estate world, granted some of the prices are going up because a lot of other concepts are also expanding and growing more quickly due to a better economy. But also by the same token, Chipotle is a really, really well-known name and landlords are excited to get us into their centers because they believe that we provide a real boost to the excitement of their center. And so we find that we're able to get more than our fair share of deals, but on both the people side and on the real estate side, we have very high standards and we want to make sure that we have loads of restaurateurs and excellent general managers and really good field leaders to open up new restaurants and so we're always watching that carefully and not wanting to overstress the cultural side of what we do. But likewise, on the real estate side, we want to open aggressively, but also in a measured way where we're being careful to make sure that we're selecting great, great real estate. And while we are able to go into more secondary sorts of locations than we were, say, 10, 11, 12, 13 years ago with much more success, we still want to do that in a balanced way. So yes, we agree we can, over time, grow faster, but we don't find it super important to rush anything in that regard. What's most important to us is to continue to do a great job with our real estate and a great job with our managers and run terrific restaurants such that the demand for what we're doing continues to outstrip the supply, such that when we open new restaurants, we have this really great success with our new restaurant openings, which, I think, you heard in Jack's remarks that now we're looking at sort of $1.8 million to $1.9 million for those new restaurant openings and a great return pretty much out of the box, which very quickly catches up over the next few years with these very high average unit volumes that we now have, which are somewhere in the $2.47 million range per restaurant. So by continuing to create demand, we continue to have a huge opportunity out in front of us and that allows us to feel really good about our future and our growth."

Jeff, I think the answer is it is an option and it's an idea that has occurred to us and we even experimented with. But really, what's most important for us is to continue to implement the 4 pillars, the throughput, because right now, our average restaurant in the country does something about 1/3 of the transactions during lunch as our fastest restaurant in the country does. And so the #1 opportunity for us along the main service line is that we can go much, much, much faster and we continue, like I said in my remarks, we have gotten quicker even though in the fourth quarter, we're at a pace that, while it's as quick as our busiest season, it's close to and faster than our busiest season used to be at throughput. But we continue to make these throughput gains, but we think that there's so much low-hanging fruits still in terms of speeding up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks that adding a second line would be more disruptive to our operation and to the design of our restaurants than it would be helpful to the unit economic model at this point. That being said, we do have to keep in mind, in almost all of our restaurants, a second make line that we have historically referred to as the fax line where we can serve catering orders or out-of-store orders, iPhone orders and such that keeps those orders, many of which are larger orders, off our main service line. Early in my comments, just now I mentioned that we have tried the 2-line method. We had a restaurant in France, at la Défense, which is a business center right near Paris, where we do have -- well, it's 1 really long line, but people come in and go in 2 directions, so it is 2 service lines with 2 separate areas, 2 separate cash registers and so forth. It works and it works just fine. Like I said, it was just not the strategy we need to implement right now. And in that location, we had a situation where we had a lot of additional square feet where we could put that into place without losing other aspects of the operation. So at this point, we're going to continue to focus on the main service line, implementing the 4 pillars of throughput and driving great throughput so that we can have a nice, tidy, efficient unit economic model."

And so our belief has always been that we have a vision to change food culture, the fast food culture in this country. And if we're successful with that, we just believe that we can add lots and lots of value and we've done that. We've done that, I think, even maybe more than a lot of people including ourselves thought were possible 8 years ago when we first went public and so we think that our vision is working or it's becoming a reality. People more than ever care about where their food comes from, recognize that Chipotle is offering something that many other restaurant companies don't or are unable to offer and so we've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price, knowing that the stock price will take care of itself if we're successful. Then back to the, why not just do kind of an every year thing. It's not linear. Inflation, food inflation is not linear and so we don't think our price increases should be linear. And in addition to that, even if you did have regular inflationary pressure, we're constantly investing in our food and so we might have significant investments that we want to make 1 year. And in the early days, when we were first introducing naturally raised meets to our market, that would dictate the timing of when we would go ahead and raise prices. And so we don't think that the way our cost, either because of food with integrity or because of inflation, is ever going to be kind of a linear 1% to 2% or 3% per year, and so we don't think the pricing should be linear as well, so that would be the way I would describe it."

The reason that we believe development costs are going to come down is, a few fold. One thing is that just in 2014, we had an unusually high number of free standards. Sometimes, we sort of take what we can get, that's not necessarily the result of a strategic objective to open more of them. We just happened to find more of them in 2014 that met our screens and look like exciting pieces of real estate that we should build Chipotle restaurants in. In 2015, it's looking like that a lot more of our mix is going to the end cap locations, which tend to do wondrously well, but also tend to cost less to build. More of our bread-and-butter, you might say. So also, we think we can get development costs down because we're working very hard from a design standpoint to implement some of our new better design methodologies, but to do it in a more efficient way and to gain some economies of scale in what we're doing. So we're approaching the development cost puzzle from a number of different directions. But strategically, we're not trying to eliminate free-standers, we just understand that the end cap locations, that we do very, very well with them.

When you say flat, yes, flat sequentially, but not flat compared to last year. In terms of higher throughput, higher throughput really comes into play more so as we move into the spring months. This is seasonally our lower average daily sales period and so throughput is important throughout the year, but it becomes even more important as the weather gets nicer, as more and more people are out and about. Our lines tend to get a little bit longer. And if our throughput is excellent at that time, volumes actually won't get longer and so people will walk into Chipotle, be served quickly and so that's when we would expect to see a benefit. In essence, Karen, for us to change that trend line, we're going to have to invite more customers in, have faster throughput, as I mentioned, as we hit more of our seasonally higher sales month. And hopefully, we will see a trend change. Very often, we do see a trend change or 2 or 3 during the year. We just haven't happened to see one as we've moved just a few weeks from the fourth quarter and into January so far. And then, in terms of the impact on the customer, Chipotle has never really seen a lot of sensitivity in terms of when customers -- when the recession first hit, we weren't the first, in fact, we were one of the last ones to see any impact on our sales. And when the recession was ending and we were coming out of the recession, we were the first ones to see a sales increase and we returned to double digit comps pretty quickly as the recession was ending. And so generally, our customers come to Chipotle, sure, they say it's great value. When we do research, our customers give us very, very high scores on the great value, but we have very loyal customers such that they don't stop coming to Chipotle when they have a few less dollars in their pockets, and they don't all of a sudden say, boy, I'm going to start going to Chipotle more often because I got a few more bucks. I think, the good news here is that people find ways to visit Chipotle and it's not necessarily affected by whether they've got a few extra bucks in their pocket. Our customer loyalty kind of overcomes these what I would call relatively minor changes in our customers' spending ability."

During all those 20 years and particularly during the year since we've been public, we've been hearing a crescendo of people wondering why we don't add additional menu items and change other aspects of what we do, and yet we've had the highest comps, I think, in the history of the restaurant business during that time. And likewise, we keep trying to improve the quality of our culture, so we have better people serving you. We've been increasing or improving the quality of our average raw ingredient, every ingredient we have has been under our scrutiny in order to make sure the food tastes as good as it can taste. Then we worked on throughput to make sure that, that aspect of the customer experience also improves. And what we me find is that by focusing on those things that we do really, really well, but yet getting even better at them, we've been able to sustain a much stronger comp than any other restaurant company has done. So while it may look like we're staring down the pike at sort of flattening sales and no increased comps, it looked that way 10 years ago, and 9 years ago and 8 years ago and 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 years ago, and I think, even a year ago, if you looked at what our guidance was for the year, I believe at the very beginning of 2014, we said that there would be a low single digit comp. And I think, or flat to low single digit comp. And that looked like what it was going to be at the time. How did we get to a mid-teen, mid to high teen comp? Doing that which we do, even better. And so it is possible, of course, that our comp will flatten out and there won't be a sequential trend changes to the positive, but we hope that our continued focus on trying to do everything we do better will work out just super."

We've moved to a whole another sales level here and so the fact that we've had some what I'd call relatively modest labor inefficiencies, somewhere in the maybe 50, 60, 70 basis points kind of range, we're not going to be in a hurry to shake that loose. We're aware of it, our teams are aware of it, and so I wouldn't see additional inefficiencies creep in. And at some point in the future, I just wouldn't want to pinpoint when, we believe we'll get this efficiency back, but I wouldn't see a similar kind of step up for the reasons I just mentioned.

I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. 2014 was an extraordinary year for our business and we're off to a strong start in 2015. During the quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $1.1 billion, an increase of 20% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 10.4% and the opening of 49 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $3.88 per share, an increase of 47%. These results are particularly strong considering that we were up against 13.4% same-store sales growth in Q1 last year and faced with harsh winter conditions in much of the country including many important Chipotle markets. We also saw some challenges related to our decision to stop serving in some of our restaurants. However, the strength of our business has weathered these challenges and merged to set us up for a great year in 2015. 
Our performance is the direct result of our continued focus on the things that really drive our business, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. We have a strong history of establishing very high standards for food we serve. Standards that are very often hard to meet given our requirements for the ingredients we use. We've encountered challenges from time to time since we began our journey to find the very best ingredients we can and we do not anticipate our recent pork supply issue to be our last one. But our track record of driving positive change in these areas is unprecedented and we believe these higher-quality ingredients taste better. 
In January, we suspended one of our pork suppliers after a supply chain audit found that they were not fully compliant with all of our standards. Our protocol requires that pigs are raised with access to the outdoors or deep betting in barns and without the use of antibiotics. These differences are in stark contrast to the way conventional pigs are raised. In many cases, they spend their whole lives indoors on hard-flatted doors with no bedding, which we think is inhumane. When we found that one of our suppliers was falling short on some of our acquirements, we knew that removing this pork from our supply was the right thing to do, but our decision left us without enough pork and the resulting outages affected more than 1/3 of our restaurants. While many of our customers were incredibly proud that we took a stand to do what was right, we also knew that there was risks involved and that we would encounter challenges in replacing this supply. 
There is very little cushion today in the supply system for pork that meets our standards and ultimately, the solution requires increasing the number of pigs that are available. This does not happen quickly. Recognizing this near-term supply constraint, we have been looking hard to find more pork that meets our protocols. Our long-term suppliers have partnered with us to increase their output to Responsibly Raised pork, however, this alone will not be enough to remedy the situation and our shortage will remain at more than 1/3 of our restaurant as we enter the peak spring and summer periods. We have also looked at the possibility of adding new suppliers and have explored options to use other types of pork as a way to get more supply. Each of these potential solutions has their own unique complications. That said, we now believe that we have found a solution with a new supplier to help us fill our gap. Our team is conducting on site business to inspect all facets of the operation and we're encouraged by what we have seen so far. At this point, we plan to begin introducing this new pork in some of our restaurants in the coming months. If all goes as planned, we believe that we will be steadily increasing our supply throughout the third quarter and back in full supply during the fourth quarter.
While the commitments we make and the way we run our business can be difficult, they are also helping to differentiate Chipotle in enabling us to build stronger relationships with our customers, particularly younger customers. New research out during the quarter from investment firms shows that the fast casual sector has surpassed casual dining in terms of frequency of visits with 45% of consumers saying that they spend my money eating out in 2014 up from 37% in 2013, and pointing to gains in popularity among fast casual restaurants. In this study, Chipotle was named as the favored restaurant more than any other with twice as many mentions as the #2 company on the list. Another study shows that millenials, key customers for Chipotle, are eating out at fast casual restaurants more than Generation X or boomers, and that their dissatisfaction with traditional fast food is higher than other generations. We believe that the loyalty we are building with key customer groups is very much a result of our commitment to doing what is right in addition to the excellent customer service that we provide. 
As we move closer to resolving the supply issues that have left a short of, we believe the pieces are in place for us to deliver strong performance throughout the year and to help us continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our ability to deliver excellent results depends on the continued success of the special people culture that we have created at Chipotle. This culture continues to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience while simultaneously allowing us to develop the excellent leaders we will need to accommodate our future growth and help us to maintain our strong unit economic model. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our restaurant teams, adding 42 new Restaurateurs and promoting 11 in the field leadership roles, either a credit team leaders or area managers. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and develop them to reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at the very best, we're able to do things in our restaurants that are other restaurant companies simply cannot do. Not only are our teams running extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food and using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they're also elevating the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an extraordinary dining experience and to deliver such a strong unit economics.
The strength of our culture is evident in many ways, including growing the number of individual success stories as more and more people are climbing the ladder from crew to management, and field leadership position as well. In fact last year alone, we promoted more than 10,500 people who started as crew in the management positions. More than 78% of our Restaurateurs started with this as crew, many having never even worked in a restaurant before. During the quarter, one particular leader really captured our attention. Montel Millet's, who demonstrated his ability to assemble a team of all top performers and then empower them to achieve high standards in this restaurants, became our youngest Restaurateur ever at only 19 years old. Monty came to Chipotle 2 years ago, discouraged by his first job in a fast food restaurant. He wanted to work in an environment where the circumstances are encouraging and where he saw opportunities to advance, learn and grow. He came to our College Park restaurant in Maryland for an interview and was hired on the spot. He had a group of very strong leaders such as Gabby Portio who is now a Restaurateur and Patricia Aguila, a Restaurateur who has been promoted to field leader and is now actually a team leader at Chipotle. His team immediately recognized that despite not having significant experience, Montel embodied the 13 characteristics of a top performer and the drive to empower others around them. 
A year later, he was a service manager working to develop his replacement, so he can move to the apprentice role. In the 19 years, was promoted to General Manager at the new Chipotle restaurant where we opened in Maryland city. From the beginning, Montel set his sights on developing a team of all top performers. He then shared this Restaurateur vision with all of them and connected with each person on his team by getting to know them, sharing his own dreams and desires, and demonstrating to them how he could help them become leaders in their own rights. Montel's story is just one of a number of truly inspiring stories of people who come to Chipotle, motivated by our food culture and the people culture and who share our vision and work hard to achieve it. These stories really illustrate the opportunities we're offering at Chipotle to top performers who are able to deliver fantastic customer experience and elevate the people around them to help them reach their potential.
These opportunities are not only very rewarding to those who take advantage of them, they also provide the people that we will need to lead our continued growth at Chipotle. One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which among other things, generates great throughput. Our team understand that the qualities that make for great throughput are exactly the same qualities that provide the very best customer service, having everything ready in a restaurant before the customers arrives so we're prepared for service particularly in our busiest times, and clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed. 
We continue to increase our average transactions throughout the day including our peak lunch and peak dinner hours. During the quarter, we increased average transactions by 21 across the entire day, a tremendous accomplishment. This continues -- this continued improvement is a product of our outstanding restaurant teams and our ongoing attention to providing better service, but also our continued emphasis on the 4 pillars of throughput, which are using a linebacker and dedicated export at peak times, proper news on clause and having the very best person in each position on the line during our busiest time. Since we started reporting on the progress our restaurants are making in implementing these 4 pillars, we have seen continued improvement in throughput, which we believe will become increasingly important now as we head into our busiest months of the year.
Finally, on the development front, we are well on track to meet our initial guidance to open 190 to 205 new restaurants during this year. During the quarter, we opened 49 new restaurants including 1 new ShopHouse, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,831, including 10 ShopHouses and 2 Pizzeria Locale. We continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline and are increasing our mix of new construction deals. Building restaurants in newly constructed centers is less costly for us, so this increasing new developments should help offset some of the higher development costs that we saw in 2014. We're continuing to evaluate new market opportunities proceeds and anticipate entering new markets for both ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale this year. We previously announced our plans to introduce Pizzeria Locale in Kansas City and also expect to open in a third market, Cincinnati, later this year. 
We're pleased with our results for the quarter and our start to 2015. The strong food culture, unique and empowered people culture, and industry-leading in economics, we're well positioned to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.

The reason for this is simple, very early on, we decided to spend more on our ingredients and less on our marketing. It's always been our belief that better quality food, prepared by hand and served by excellent teams would be the most powerful marketing of all. In fact, we were serving better ingredients including pasturate dairy, local produce and meats without antibiotics or hormones long before there was even significant customer demand for such things. Overtime, this has created powerful differentiation between Chipotle and other fast food brands. This approach has served us well and our ongoing marketing research makes us confident that this is the case. Chipotle has become quite buzzworthy with awareness coming from social media, public relations, advertising and our local and event marketing programs, but with less reliance on traditional advertising in many of our [indiscernible] programs in areas other than advertising generates considerable attention and awareness and as does, the breakthrough nature of our content programs, which have reached well beyond what we would get through traditional advertising. We are also seeing greater interest among customers who are looking to eat healthier and defining healthy around such characteristics such as natural and minimally processed ingredients exactly the same kind of ingredients we use to make our food. We're also see a majority of customers, about 60% are willing to pay more for better food, food that is made without artificial ingredients. All of these findings really support the way we run our business and our marketing and all the traits that are reflected in various aspects of our marketing.
The various -- the vast majority of fast food brands use limited time offers, new menu items and price promotions as their core marketing strategy. These new menu items and offers rarely build long-term loyal customers, instead only provide a spike in sales during their advertising window. In order to maintain traffic, most fast food brands need to add a steady stream of new menu items throughout the year, resulting in bloated menus filled with hundreds of menu items. Not only is this marketing approach incredibly expensive, the cluttered menus can be confusing to customers and difficult for the restaurant crews to execute, but the most significant downside to this approach is that these new menu items are often made from cheap, artificial ingredients and are highly processed. These menus of highly processed items are proving problematic as customers are increasingly concerned with a long list of artificial ingredients found in foods today. There are more than 800 artificial ingredients, preservatives and processing aids used in processed foods. In fact, there are 85 ingredients in a single fast food burrito, served by 1 of our competitors. 
For years, our marketing has superiority of our ingredients including our use of local produce pasteurized dairy and meats without antibiotics and added hormones, but more recently, we have come to expand our marketing messages to highlight the small number of whole, unprocessed ingredients used in our food. In fact, there are only 68 ingredients used to prepare all of the food we serve at Chipotle, the vast majority of which are simple ingredients you could buy at the local market. Only our tortillas contain any preservatives or other additives and we are diligently working to eliminate those. The fact that Chipotle uses better quality ingredients as well known, but the fact that our food contains virtually none of these artificial ingredients that other fast food contains literally -- and other fast food contains literally hundreds of them will further differentiate Chipotle from the competition. That's why we have developed a new marketing platform called collective beauty, which is our internal designation for the program that highlights the simple beauty of the minimal number of whole unprocessed ingredients in our food. The campaign includes several phases and will be rolled out over the coming year. Currently, the campaign is running in print, outdoor and radio across 30 of our top markets. Additionally, we are running more national advertising than ever before leveraging print, streaming radio, search and social. The campaign runs in 2 flights, 1 this spring and another this fall. During the summer break between advertising fights, we'll be launching a large online initiative for collected beauty. 
Beyond this expansion of our marketing strategy, strengthening our e-commerce programs is a top priority for us this year. Over the last year, we worked on a project to incorporate mobile payment in the Chipotle ordering apps. We had hoped that this capability would've been available in the updated app release in December 2014, but we were not happy with how it was working, particularly in light of the continually evolving landscape of mobile payment. Our commitment to support mobile payment has not changed, but our approach has. We are broadening our view of mobile payment to include more than simply paying for restaurant transactions using our app. Our near-term priorities with regard to mobile include the launch of an ordering out for Apple Watch, which will be available Apple 24th, and the exploration of new systems for mobile payment including the use of Apple Pay in our restaurants and our iOS app, and potentially Google Wallet capability within our Android app. We are making progress with all of these initiatives and we'll keep you apprised if these programs evolve. 
Last, we also relaunched our chipotle.com website with better accessibility and functionality for mobile users. Additionally, we have begun delivery of online and mobile orders for individual and small groups in 67 cities using the post delivery app. We selected post made as our official delivery partner in March and now they are currently delivering Chipotle orders in all of the markets where they operate. Finally, with regard to our catering programs, we will begin advertising catering in a number of markets as we come close to graduation season, historically, a busy season for catering packages and expect to see continued momentum in this area during that peak time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."
26446,283618758,791437,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. We're very proud of our results for the quarter as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or 20% increase as compared to last year and EPS was up 47% in the quarter. Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark for",1963,"Thanks, Mark. We're very proud of our results for the quarter as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or 20% increase as compared to last year and EPS was up 47% in the quarter. Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark for the first time and we took a little more than 3 years that our average volumes past $2 million for the first time, meaning that we've been able to increase our average volume by more than $500,000 per restaurant while adding more than 600 new restaurants during the past 3 years. This obviously has had a significant positive effect on unit economics and it means we're serving more -- Chipotle to more and more people in new and existing restaurants as we pursue our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. 
As you know this year, we faced the most difficult comp comparisons we've ever had as a public company, including lapping the menu price increase from Q2 of last year. We're pleased with the 10.4% comp in the quarter on top of the 13.4% comp from last year and we believe the comp was affected by weather especially in parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and regions in the south and by the pork shortage, which Steve talked about. It's difficult to put a precise impact on the combined effect of weather and the park shortage during the quarter, but we believe the comp could have been as much as 100 to 200 basis points higher with normalized weather and had we've been able to serve, in all of our restaurants. And it's not possible to separate the weather impact from the effect of the pork shortage since they have happened at roughly the same time. We normally talked about weather not having a net impact on our sales, as our sales typically come roaring back after the big snowstorm, offsetting the lower sales caused by the storm. But the weather impact this year lasted for many weeks in most markets, so any sales bounce back could not offset the full effect of the bad weather. Our comps were highest in January and lowest in March, similar to some macro retail trends and consistent with the premise that the weather was like slightly a factor in February and March. Until so far in April are trending slightly higher than March, which tells us that weather was at least partially a factor in the first quarter.
So what does all that mean for our sales trends going forward? Well comps in April so far appear on track to be in the high single digits and we think our pork shortage is currently impacting our sales by as much as 200 basis points. We have not seen immediate impact on sales and markets when we first ran out of pork, but a research and our sales analysis suggests that our carnitas customers really love our pork and they appear to be visiting less often or not at all until they know we have carnitas again in our market. Now this announced surprising as the vast majority of our customers tend to find their favorite burrito or favorite Bo coronation and then they order that favorite meal every single time they visit. We had hope that the shortage would encourage our carnitas customers to try another menu option and some did, but many have decided to hold out until carnitas returns to the market. And as a reminder, we rotated markets withoout pork about every 6 weeks and so every 1 of our markets has been affected at some time or another. We found that when we rotated supply back to a particular market, it can take weeks before our carnitas product mix returns to the previous product mix levels as a result of our carnitas loving customers not realizing we were back in supply of carnitas until they visited less often. In other words, this rolling blackout has caused confusion among our customers about where and when we were out of carnitas and this has worsened the sales impact.
Because of this phenomenon, we're going to stop the rolling blackout and continuously serve carnitas in our markets where the carnitas product mix tends to be the highest starting later this month. Based on actual April trends and factoring tougher comparisons in May and June, including the lapping of last year's menu price increase, Q2 comps overall are likely to be in the low to mid-single digits, so that comp assumes that we continue to see as much as a 200 basis point negative impact on the pork shortage. As Steve mentioned, we expect additional pork to be returning to our restaurants beginning in the third quarter with a full return of carnitas during the fourth quarter. It also assumes no incremental menu price increase in Q2 related to the elevated beef prices, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. That also is before any potential sales lift we might get from our marketing campaign that Mark talked about or other impacts such as faster throughput.
By the way, at the 10.4% comp in the quarter, about 6.1% relates to the price increase from last year and most of the rest was due to higher traffic with a small increase in average check due to positive mix including greater group size and catering. Of course, we're disappointed as our carnitas-loving customers that we have not been able to satisfy their craving and we don't love the fact that our sales have been impacted by the shortage, but we remain committed to our food integrity mission and we are as confident as ever that we made the right decision to suspend the pork supplier based on our animal welfare protocols and we're optimistic that the new pork suppliers we talked about will help us at least to reduce the impact of the shortage in the customers and on our sales soon.
Overall for the year, we continue to expect comps in the low to mid-single digits, which is consistent with the outlook we initially provided for the year. Again, this does not factor in any menu price increases related to beef or any sales recoveries from eliminating the pork shortage. We're pleased to finally see some relief on our food cost line with food cost declining from 35% in the fourth quarter to 33.9% in Q1. The main contributor to the decrease were from relief in dairy cost and favorable pricing from avocados. Dairy pricing has largely been expected to be realized as a broader commodity market increase supply during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the trend was relatively stable throughout the quarter. With avocado pricing, we have observed a slight increase in supply and that has temporarily help to keep the prices reasonable through the early months of 2015. However, we anticipate that normal seasonal shifts will pressure the avocado market in Q2 and Q3, as we buy more avocados from California growers.
Beef prices remain at historically high levels, although beef inflation was largely contained during the quarter. We currently believe that the pricing for beef will remain at these elevated levels well into 2016 and perhaps even into 2017. As a result of these increased inflation, we expect to raise prices on the steak of this year, most likely by the end of the third quarter and while we are still carefully reviewing our options, we anticipate an average increase of around 4% to 6%, which would have a net effect of about 100 basis points based on the current product mix of our steak and barbacoa. And as you'll recall, our intent last year was to cover the inflationary cost pressures of beef, but we under shop this level in hindsight as costs continue to rise. Now while it's important to our vision that we remain accessible and affordable to our customers, we also want to charge our customers the going rate for the ingredients that we use. And as a reminder, we saw virtually no trade down for steak and barbacoa last year, but we increased prices for these entrées more than other menu items. 
One final note related to food cost in the quarter, we included a one-time write off to the cost of sales associated with the carnitas inventory of $1.7 million we chose to donate rather than serve the porks, which did not meet our protocols. This write-off was offset by a small change in the classification of miscellaneous kitchen supplies, which shifted from the food cost line to the other operating cost during the quarter.
Labor cost for the first quarter were 22.4% of sales, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Leverage for the quarter was largely driven by higher sales volumes, which include the benefit of the higher menu prices and that was slightly offset by wage inflation. Out of these costs were 5.8% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points from last year and other operating costs were 10.4% of sales or 10 basis points lower than last year. Marketing expenses in the quarter were 0.9% of sales compared to 1.3% in the prior year and it's in line with expectations and lower than our full year outlook as we will ramp up additional marketing costs during Q2 and Q3 related to the campaign that Mark discussed. Restaurant level margins increased 160 basis points to 27.5%, benefiting from strong revenue growth compared to last year. G&A was 5.8% of sales in the quarter down from 7.4% last year, and was driven by the lower noncash stock comp. For the full year 2015, we expect noncash stock comp expense to be about $80 million, which is down $18 million from last year. Executive comp was restructured, resulting in an estimated $33 million reduction and executive comp for the full, while additional brands to restaurant management and staff are expected to offset the noncash stock comp by about $15 million. Total stock comp in the first quarter was about $16.6 million compared to about $27.6 million last year. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are refocusing our e-commerce program to build a mobile platform that moves beyond simply incorporating mobile payment into our ordering app. We incurred a loss of on this assets about $2.8 million associated with some of the prior development work. 
Effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.4% and for full year, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.7% compared to 37.6% for the full year in 2014. 2014 benefited from our estimated usable, federal and state credits and from the work opportunity in R&D federal tax credits, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points. We finished the quarter with 1,831 restaurants and our average unit volume have helped pushed our return on investment up to nearly 80% and economic return that we're very proud to achieve. As of March 31, we held cash and investments of about $1.4 billion including short and long-term interest-bearing investments and we continue to have no debt on our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $23 million of our stock on average share price of $675 and we currently have $179 million remaining on our share buyback program, which was previously approved by our board. We continue to believe that reinvesting in the growth of our business remains the best use of our cash, although we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stocks to enhance shareholder value.

We're now $2.5 million, in fact that we have a $500,000 in volume while adding the September restaurants I talked about over the last 3 years, I think is pretty substantial. If you go back to the 3 years before that, that was a 3-year trend as well, that that had to start and to stop and it was pretty clean 2010, '11, and '12, during that 3-year period and you can see where it started. You can see where it ended and that was about a 27% or 28% or 29% increase and so we seem to have these ways and if you go back even as we were a private company, these waves where people figure out that Chipotle exists they likely to come back more and so we have this kind of surge and then we have a leveling off, a surge and leveling off, very tough to predict, will we have another surge? When will we have it? What were the magnitude of that surge be? But we continue to believe that there's a great appreciation and a growing appreciation for what we do at Chipotle. We do think millenials in particular are very appreciative of what we do. We think this campaign that's designed to reinforce the idea that not only do we source sustainably raised ingredients, but we do real cooking with real whole ingredients and we largely don't use things like preservatives and stabilizers and things like that. So we believe that, that is not something that is short-lived. That's over, we think that we'll probably benefit from that. But in terms of them breaking that down into exactly what that's going to do for the next 2 or 3 quarters, it's tougher to predict and the comparisons are tough, but over the longer term, we're optimistic about where we can go from here."

And we'll see if we can keep pushing the needle, but I think it's going to get strong over the next 2 quarters in terms of throughput.

Like I said, we think we can continue to go faster as the pressure of a busy second and third quarter comes to us. Over the last couple of years, even 3 years now sort of in a row, we've consistently set a new high water mark on throughput during our second and third quarters particularly, each year. So we're getting faster and faster, we think that we're not sort of close to being at the point where we can't get faster. That is to say there's a long, sort of a lot of runway on our ability to get faster. But I just want to sort of caution on the throughput thing. Throughput is something that's very important, we have a lot of people come through our doors. It's always important because it's part of the customer service, and it's always important because when our throughput is fast, our food tastes better because our burritos are rolled and assembled and served to customers while they're still is hot. But throughput doesn't happen in the vacuum. When we have more pressure on our teams, longer lines, more customers then it is a time when you see our throughput numbers get better. That being said, throughput doesn't -- if we don't have people come through our doors, there's opportunity on throughput and some stores that are not going fast enough, but you're not going to see as much of an ability to ramp up throughput. So great throughput, overtime will cause I think more customers to enjoy Chipotle, because they're going to trust that we can get to them more quickly and it's more of a convenient experience. But great throughput doesn't -- it will not add a comp in a vacuum, you have to have the transactions come through your door."

If you look at what we're doing now and in the past, we've touted what we call our hero ingredients, we talked a lot about naturally raised or Responsibly Raised meats, local produce, faster rates there, that kind of thing. But there are a number of other competitors who are trying to say similar things, but the approach we're taking now is to expand that platform to include essentially what's not in our food, these 800 or so chemical additives, which are used to make processed food that is sold in most fast food. And the fact that Chipotle only has 65 ingredients in our entire -- or 67 ingredients in our entire company is really remarkable. So the new complain is designed to prove that to people, to show that to them in a very interesting compelling way. That will further differentiate Chipotle in a way that frankly, the competitors can't mimic. You can't take all of this junk out of these other processed menu items and other fast food companies, they just basically can't do it. While they can mimic some of our past marketing, I think it will be very difficult for them to do this, so I expect this new approach to have potential even greater impact than the ones previously."

We're doing it at the same time this year. We're actually spending more than ever this year. You can see lumps in the spend because of how we developed the brand building content, like the short films or the television series. You can see that impact to marketing budget in ways that would make it look as if we're spending more that moment when we're not. So I don't think there's meaningful correlation between the spend of marketing and what we're seeing right now. What we're doing with marketing is pretty much exactly what we did last year."

I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. 2014 was an extraordinary year for our business, and we're off to a strong start in 2015. During the quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $1.1 billion, an increase of 20% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 10.4% and the opening of 49 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $3.88 per share, an increase of 47%. These results are particularly strong considering that we were up against 13.4% same-store sales growth in Q1 last year and faced with harsh winter conditions in much of the country, including many important Chipotle markets. We also saw some challenges related to our decision to stop serving carnitas in some of our restaurants. However, the strength of our business has weathered these challenges and merged to set us up for a great year in 2015.
Our performance is the direct result of our continued focus on the things that really drive our business, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. We have a strong history of establishing very high standards for food we serve, standards that are very often hard to meet given our requirements for the ingredients we use. We have encountered challenges from time to time since we began our journey to find the very best ingredients we can, and we do not anticipate our recent pork supply issue to be our last one. But our track record of driving positive change in these areas is unprecedented, and we believe these higher-quality ingredients taste better.
In January, we suspended one of our pork suppliers after a supply chain audit found that they were not fully compliant with all of our standards. Our protocol requires that pigs are raised with access to the outdoors or deep bedding in barns and without the use of antibiotics. These differences are in stark contrast to the way conventional pigs are raised. In many cases, they spend their whole lives indoors on hard, flattened floors with no bedding, which we think is inhumane. When we found that one of our suppliers was falling short on some of our requirements, we knew that removing this pork from our supply was the right thing to do. But our decision left us without enough pork, and the resulting outages affected more than 1/3 of our restaurants. While many of our customers were incredibly proud that we took a stand to do what was right, we also knew that there was risks involved and that we would encounter challenges in replacing this supply.
There is very little cushion today in the supply system for pork that meets our standards, and ultimately, the solution requires increasing the number of pigs that are available. This does not happen quickly. Recognizing this near-term supply constraint, we have been looking hard to find more pork that meets our protocols. Our long-term suppliers have partnered with us to increase their output of responsibly raised pork. However, this alone will not be enough to remedy the situation, and our shortage will remain at more than 1/3 of our restaurants as we enter the peak spring and summer periods.
We have also looked at the possibility of adding new suppliers and have explored options to use other types of pork as a way to get more supply. Each of these potential solutions has their own unique complications. That said, we now believe that we have found a solution with a new supplier to help us fill our gap. Our team is conducting on-site visits to inspect all facets of the operation, and we're encouraged by what we have seen so far. At this point, we plan to begin introducing this new pork in some of our restaurants in the coming months. If all goes as planned, we believe that we will be steadily increasing our supply throughout the third quarter and back in full supply during the fourth quarter.
While the commitments we make and the way we run our business can be difficult, they are also helping to differentiate Chipotle in enabling us to build stronger relationships with our customers, particularly younger customers. New research out during the quarter from investment firm shows that the fast-casual sector has surpassed casual dining in terms of frequency of visits with 45% of consumers saying that they spend my money eating out in 2014, up from 37% in 2013 and pointing to gains in popularity among fast-casual restaurants. In this study, Chipotle was named as the favored restaurant more than any other with twice as many mentions as the #2 company on the list. Another study shows that millennials, key customers for Chipotle, are eating out at fast-casual restaurants more than Generation Xers or boomers and that their dissatisfaction with traditional fast food is higher than other generations. We believe that the loyalty we are believed -- or that we are building with key customer groups is very much a result of our commitment to doing what is right in addition to the excellent customer service that we provide. As we move closer to resolving the supply issues that have left us short of carnitas, we believe the pieces are in place for us to deliver strong performance throughout the year and to help us continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our ability to continue to deliver excellent results depends on the continued success of the special people culture that we have created at Chipotle. This culture continues to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience while simultaneously allowing us to develop the excellent leaders we will need to accommodate our future growth and help us to maintain our strong unit economic model.
During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our restaurant teams, adding 42 new Restaurateurs and promoting 11 in the field leadership roles, either apprentice team leaders, team leaders or area managers. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and develop them to reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we're able to do things in our restaurants that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only are our teams running extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they're also elevating the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an extraordinary dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics.
The strength of our culture is evident in many ways, including through a growing number of individual success stories as more and more of our people are climbing the ladder from crew to management and to field leadership positions as well. In fact, last year alone, we promoted more than 10,500 people who started as crew into management positions. More than 78% of our Restaurateurs started with us as crew, many having never even worked in a restaurant before.
During the quarter, one particular leader really captured our attention, Montel Millidge [ph] , who demonstrated his ability to assemble a team of all top performers and then empower them to achieve high standards in his restaurant, became our youngest Restaurateur ever at only 19 years old. Montel [ph] came to Chipotle 2 years ago discouraged by his first job in a fast food restaurant. He wanted to work in an environment where the circumstances were encouraging and where he saw opportunities to advance, learn and grow. He came to our College Park restaurant in Maryland for an interview and was hired on the spot. He had a group of very strong leaders such as Gaby Portillo, who is now a Restaurateur; and Patricio Aguila, a Restaurateur who's been promoted to field leader and is now actually a team leader at Chipotle. His team immediately recognized that despite not having significant experience, Montel embodied the 13 characteristics of a top performer and the drive to empower others around him.
A year later, he was a service manager working to develop his replacement, so he can move to the apprentice role and at 19 years, promoted to General Manager at a new Chipotle restaurant, when we opened in Maryland City. From the beginning, Montel [ph] set his sights on developing a team of all top performers. He then shared his Restaurateur vision with all of them and connected with each person on his team by getting to know them, sharing his own dreams and desires, and demonstrating to them how he could help them become leaders in their own right. Montel's [ph] story is just one of a number of truly inspiring stories of people who come to Chipotle motivated by our food culture and the people culture and who share our vision and work hard to achieve it. These stories really illustrate the opportunities we're offering at Chipotle to top performers who are able to deliver a fantastic customer experience and elevate the people around them to help them reach their potential.
These opportunities are not only very rewarding to those who take advantage of them. They also provide the people that we will need to lead our continued growth at Chipotle. One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which, among other things, generates great throughput. Our teams understand that the qualities that make for great throughput are exactly the same qualities that provide the very best customer service, having everything ready in a restaurant before our customers arrive, so we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, and clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed.
We continue to increase our average transactions throughout the day, including our peak lunch and peak dinner hours. During the quarter, we increased average transactions by 21 across the entire day, a tremendous accomplishment. This continues -- this continued improvement is the product of our outstanding restaurant teams and their ongoing attention to providing better service but also our continued emphasis on the 4 pillars of throughput, which are using a linebacker and dedicated expo at peak times, proper mise en place and having the very best person in each position on the line during our busiest times. Since we started reporting on the progress our restaurants are making in implementing these 4 pillars, we have seen continued improvement in throughput, which we believe will become increasingly important now as we head into our busiest months of the year.
Finally, on the development front, we are well on track to meet our initial guidance to open 190 to 205 new restaurants during this year. During the quarter, we opened 49 new restaurants, including 1 new ShopHouse, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,831, including 10 ShopHouses and 2 Pizzeria Locales. We continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline and are increasing our mix of new construction deals. Building restaurants in newly constructed centers is less costly for us, so this increase in new developments should help offset some of the higher development cost that we saw in 2014. We're continuing to evaluate new market opportunities for our [ph] proceeds and anticipate entering new markets for both ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale this year. We previously announced our plans to introduce Pizzeria Locale in Kansas City and also expect to open in a third market, Cincinnati, later this year.
We're pleased with our results for the quarter and our start to 2015. With a strong food culture, unique and empowering people culture and industry leading in economics, we're well positioned to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Very early on, we decided to spend more on our ingredients and less on our marketing. It's always been our belief that better-quality food prepared by hand and served by excellent teams would be the most powerful marketing of all. In fact, we were serving better ingredients, including pasteurized dairy, local produce and meats without antibiotics or hormones long before there was even significant customer demand for such things. Over time, this has created powerful differentiation between Chipotle and other fast food brands. This approach has served us well, and our ongoing marketing research makes us confident that this is the case. Chipotle has become quite buzzworthy with awareness coming from social media, public relations, advertising and our local and event marketing programs but with less reliance on traditional advertising than many of our competitors. Strength [ph] of our programs in areas other than advertising generates considerable attention and awareness and does -- as does the break-through nature of our content programs, which have reached well beyond what we would get through traditional advertising.
We are also seeing greater interest among customers who are looking to eat healthier and defining healthy around such characteristics as natural and minimally processed ingredients, exactly the same kind of ingredients we use to make our food. And we are also see that a majority of customers, about 60%, are willing to pay more for better food, food that is made without artificial ingredients. All of these findings really support the way we run our business and our marketing and all the traits that are reflected in various aspects of our marketing.
The various -- I'm sorry, the vast majority of fast food brands use limited time offers, new menu items and price promotions as their core marketing strategy. These new menu items and offers rarely build long-term loyal customers, instead, only provide a spike in sales during their advertising window. In order to maintain traffic, most fast food brands need to add a steady stream of new menu items throughout the year, resulting in bloated menus filled with hundreds of menu items. Not only is this marketing approach incredibly expensive. The cluttered menus can be confusing to customers and difficult for the restaurant crews to execute. But the most significant downside to this approach is that these new menu items are often made from cheap, artificial ingredients and are highly processed. These menus of highly processed items are proving problematic as customers are increasingly concerned with the long list of artificial ingredients found in foods today. There are more than 800 artificial ingredients, preservatives and processing aids used in processed foods. In fact, there are over -- there are 85 ingredients in a single fast food burrito served by 1 of our competitors.
For years, our marketing has touted the superiority of our ingredients, including our use of local produce, pasteurized dairy and meats without antibiotics and added hormones, but more recently, we have come to expand our marketing messages to highlight the small number of whole, unprocessed ingredients used in our food. In fact, there are only 68 ingredients used to prepare all of the food we serve at Chipotle. The vast majority of which are simple ingredients you could buy at the local market. Only our tortillas contain any preservatives or other additives, and we are diligently working to eliminate those.
The fact that Chipotle uses better-quality ingredients is well known, but the fact that our food contains virtually none of these artificial ingredients that other fast food contains literally -- and other fast food contains literally hundreds of them will further differentiate Chipotle from the competition. That's why we have developed a new marketing platform called Collective Beauty [ph] , which is our internal designation for the program that highlights the simple beauty of the minimal number of whole, unprocessed ingredients in our food. The campaign includes several phases and will be rolled out over the coming years. Currently, the campaign is running in print, outdoor and radio across 30 of our top markets. Additionally, we are running more national advertising than ever before, leveraging print, streaming radio, search and social. The campaign runs in 2 flights, 1 this spring and another this fall. During the summer break between advertising flights, we'll be launching a large online initiative for Collective Beauty [ph] .
Beyond this expansion of our marketing strategy, strengthening our e-commerce programs is a top priority for us this year. Over the last year, we worked on a project to incorporate mobile payment into Chipotle ordering apps. We had hoped that this capability would have been available in the updated app released in December 2014, but we were not happy with how it was working, particularly in light of the continually evolving landscape of mobile payment. Our commitment to support mobile payments has not changed, but our approach has. We are broadening our view of mobile payment to include more than simply paying for in-restaurant transactions using our app. Our near-term priorities with regard to mobile include the launch of an ordering app for Apple Watch, which will be available Apple 24 (sic) [April 24], and the exploration of new systems for mobile payment, including the use of Apple Pay in our restaurants and our iOS app, and potentially Google Wallet capability within our Android app. We are making progress with all of these initiatives, and we'll keep you apprised as these programs evolve.
Last, we also relaunched our chipotle.com website with better accessibility and functionality for mobile users. Additionally, we have begun delivery of online and mobile orders for individual and small groups in 67 cities using the Postmates delivery app. We selected Postmates as our official delivery partner in March, and now they are currently delivering Chipotle orders in all of the markets where they operate.
Finally, with regard to our catering programs, we will begin advertising catering in a number of markets as we get close to graduation season, historically, a busy season for catering packages and expect to see continued momentum in this area during that peak time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."

We're very proud of our results for the quarter as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or 20% increase as compared to last year, and EPS was up 47% in the quarter. Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark for the first time, and it was just a little more than 3 years ago that our average volumes passed $2 million for the first time, meaning that we've been able to increase our average volume by more than $500,000 per restaurant while adding more than 600 new restaurants during the past 3 years. This obviously has had a significant positive effect on our unit economics, and it means we're serving more -- Chipotle to more and more people in new and existing restaurants as we pursue our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
As you know, this year, we faced the most difficult comp comparisons we've ever had as a public company, including lapping the menu price increase from Q2 of last year. We're pleased with the 10.4% comp in the quarter on top of the 13.4% comp from last year, and we believe the comp was affected by weather especially in parts of the Mid-Atlantic, the northeast and regions in the south and by the pork shortage, which Steve talked about. It's difficult to put a precise impact on the combined effect of weather and the pork shortage during the quarter, but we believe the comp could have been as much as 100 to 200 basis points higher with normalized weather and had we've been able to serve carnitas in all of our restaurants.
And it's not possible to separate the weather impact from the effect of the pork shortage since they happened at roughly the same time. We normally talk about weather not having a net impact on our sales, as our sales typically come roaring back after a big snowstorm, offsetting the lower sales caused by the storm. But the weather impact this year lasted for many weeks in most markets, so any sales bounce back could not affect -- not offset the full effect of the bad weather. Our comps were highest in January and lowest in March, similar to some macro retail trends and consistent with the premise that the weather was likely a factor in February and March, until so far in April are trending slightly higher than March, which tells us that weather was at least partially a factor in the first quarter.
So what does all that mean for our sales trends going forward? Well, comps in April, so far, appear on track to be in the high single digits, and we think our pork shortage is currently impacting our sales by as much as 200 basis points. We have not seen immediate impact on sales and markets we first ran out of pork, but our research and our sales analysis suggest that our carnitas customers really love our pork, and they appear to be visiting less often or not at all until they know we have carnitas again in their market. Now this is not surprising as the vast majority of our customers tend to find their favorite burrito or favorite bowl combination, and then they order that favorite meal every single time they visit. We had hoped that the shortage would encourage our carnitas customers to try another menu option, and some did, but many have decided to hold out until carnitas returns to their market.
And as a reminder, we rotated markets without pork about every 6 weeks, and so every 1 of our market has been affected at some time or another. We found that when we rotated supply back to a particular market, it can take weeks before our carnitas product mix returns to the previous product mix levels as a result of our carnitas-loving customers not realizing we were back in supply of carnitas, and so they visited less often. In other words, this rolling blackout has caused confusion among our customers about where and when we were out of carnitas, and this has worsened the sales impact.
Because of this phenomenon, we're going to stop the rolling blackout and continuously serve carnitas in our markets where the carnitas product mix tends to be the highest starting later this month. Based on actual April trends and factoring the tougher comparisons in May and June, including the lapping of last year's menu price increase, Q2 comps overall are likely to be in the low to mid-single digits, so that comp assumes that we continue to see as much as a 200 basis points negative impact on the pork shortage. As Steve mentioned, we expect additional pork to be returning to our restaurants beginning in the third quarter with a full return of carnitas during the fourth quarter. It also assumes no incremental menu price increase in Q2 related to the elevated beef prices, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. That also is before any potential sales lift we might get from our marketing campaign that Mark talked about or from other impacts such as faster throughput.
By the way, at the 10.4% comp in the quarter, about 6.1% relates to the price increase from last year, and most of the rest was due to higher traffic with a small increase in average check due to positive mix, including greater group size and catering. Of course, we're as disappointed as our carnitas-loving customers that we have not been able to satisfy their craving, and we don't love the fact that our sales have been impacted by the shortage. But we remain committed to our food integrity mission, and we are as confident as ever that we made the right decision to suspend the pork supplier based on our animal welfare protocols. And we're optimistic that the new pork suppliers we talked about will help us at least reduce the impact of the shortage on our customers and on our sales soon.
Overall for the year, we continue to expect comps in the low to mid-single digits, which is consistent with the outlook we initially provided for the year. And again, this does not factor in any menu price increases related to beef or any sales recovery from eliminating the pork shortage.
We're pleased to finally see some relief on our food cost line with food cost declining from 35% in the fourth quarter to 33.9% in Q1. The main contributor to the decrease were from relief in dairy cost and favorable pricing for avocados. Dairy pricing had largely been expected to be realized as the broader commodity market increased supply during the fourth quarter of 2014, and the trend was relatively stable throughout the quarter. With avocado pricing, we have observed a slight increase in supply, and that has temporarily helped to keep the prices reasonable through the early months of 2015. However, we anticipate that normal seasonal shifts will pressure the avocado market in Q2 and Q3 as we buy more avocados from California growers.
Beef prices remain at historically high levels, although beef inflation was largely contained during the quarter. We currently believe that the pricing for beef will remain at these elevated levels well into 2016 and perhaps even into 2017. As a result of this increased inflation, we expect to raise prices on steak and barbacoa this year, most likely by the end of the third quarter. And while we're still carefully reviewing our options, we anticipate an average increase of around 4% to 6%, which would have a net effect of about 100 basis points based on the current product mix of our steak and barbacoa. And as you'll recall, our intent last year was to cover the inflationary cost pressures of beef, but we under shopped this level in hindsight as beef costs continue to rise. Now while it's important to our vision that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers, we also want to charge our customers the going rate for the ingredients that we use. And as a reminder, we saw virtually no trade down from steak and barbacoa last year, when we increased prices for these entrées more than other menu items.
One final note related to food cost in the quarter, we included a one-time write-off to the cost of sales associated with the carnitas inventory of $1.7 million. We chose to donate rather than serve the pork, which did not meet our protocols. This write-off was offset by a small change in the classification of miscellaneous kitchen supplies, which shifted from the food cost line to the other operating cost during the quarter.
Labor costs for the first quarter were 22.4% of sales, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Leverage for the quarter was largely driven by higher sales volumes, which include the benefit of the higher menu prices, and that was slightly offset by wage inflation. Occupancy costs were 5.8% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points from last year, and other operating costs were 10.4% of sales or 10 basis points lower than last year. Marketing expenses during the quarter were 0.9% of sales compared to 1.3% in the prior year, and it's in line with expectations and lower than our full year outlook as we will ramp up additional marketing costs during Q2 and Q3 related to the campaign that Mark discussed.
Restaurant level margins increased 160 basis points to 27.5%, benefiting from strong revenue growth compared to last year. G&A was 5.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 7.4% last year, and it was driven by the lower noncash stock comp. For the full year 2015, we expect noncash stock comp expense to be about $80 million, which is down $18 million from last year. Executive comp was restructured resulting in an estimated $33 million reduction in executive comp for the full. While additional grants to restaurant management and staff are expected to offset the noncash stock comp by about $15 million. Total stock comp in the first quarter was about $16.6 million compared to about $27.6 million last year.
As Mark mentioned earlier, we are refocusing our e-commerce program to build a mobile platform that moves beyond simply incorporating mobile payment into our ordering app. We incurred a loss on the disposal of assets about $2.8 million associated with some of the prior development work.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.4%, and for full year, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.7% compared to 37.6% for the full year in 2014. 2014 benefited from our estimated usable federal and state credits and from the work opportunity in R&D federal tax credits, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points.
We finished the quarter with 1,831 restaurants, and our average unit volumes have helped push our return on investment up to nearly 80%, an economic return that we're very proud to achieve. As of March 31, we held cash and investments of about $1.4 billion, including short- and long-term interest-bearing investments, and we continue to have no debt on our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $23 million of our stock on average share price of $675, and we currently have $179 million remaining on our share buyback program, which was previously approved by our board. We continue to believe that reinvesting into the growth of our business remains the best use of our cash, although we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.

I would expect that 6.6% to increase along with the higher catering expected in the next quarter. We don't know where it can go, but we do know some competitors talk about their total catering in the 8%, 9%, 10% range. And so we think we've got a lot of room to grow. Catering is very young. We still think that our mobile ordering, as Mark talked about, we could do a lot more with the ordering, with the payment, with the way that we accommodate those orders in restaurants. So we think we have a lot of room to do a better job with all that. In terms of where it can go, we don't know.

We're in the third year of a trend that started in early 2013. And if you remember, our comp in 2013 was 1%, and the year before that, we were on a kind of a deceleration as we were finishing up a 3-year trend that started in 2010. And so if you go back to 2013 and you look, we grew comps from 1% and then 5%, then 6%, then 9% and with double digits, and now we're comparing against those strong double digits. And I think if you combine those 3 years together, you'll see a 3-year trend that for the first quarter with 2015 being the third year, the comp was about 24.8%. Now we know that was affected by weather and pork, and so it was suppressed a little bit. But if you make an adjustment for weather and pork. I think for the rest of the year, you can think in terms of a 3-year combined sales comp, and that would put you in kind of the 25%, 26% range or so. And I think that's a better way to think about it. So in those terms, I think that we should stay in that same kind of ballpark.

And you can see where it started. You can see where it ended, and that was about a 27% or 28% or 29% increase. And so we seem to have these waves, and then if you go back even as we were a private company, these waves where people figure out that Chipotle exists, they like it. They come back more often. And so we have this kind of surge, and then we have a leveling off and then a surge and a leveling off. Very tough to predict will we have another surge, when will we have it, what will the magnitude of that surge be. But we continue to believe that there's a great appreciation and a growing appreciation for what we do at Chipotle. We do think millennials, in particular, are very appreciative of what we do. We think this campaign that's designed to reinforce the idea that not only do we source sustainably raised ingredients but we do real cooking with real whole ingredients, and we largely don't use things like preservatives and stabilizers and things like that. So we believe that, that is not something that is short lived, that's over. We think that we'll probably benefit from that.

And in fact, at this time, we've just started a national sort of throughput contest just to sort of make it top of mind with our restaurant teams, have some fun with it and bring awareness to those who are doing the best job with it just like we did with the reporting at nationwide from team director to team director. But this way, we actually have a little bit of a contest for bragging rights, and we'll see if we can keep pushing the needle. But I think it's going to get strong over the next 2 quarters in terms of throughput. Now of course, our ability to put through more people depends on having more people come through our doors as well, so throughput will not in and of itself drive transactions. It's just that when you have transactions come in, if you don't have good throughput, you are stifling your ability to allow those additional transactions to come in the door. So -- but yes, we're excited about, hopefully, continuing to improve on our execution of the 4 pillars and on our execution of throughput."

Like I said, we think we can continue to go faster as the pressure of a busy second and third quarter comes to us. Over the last couple of years, even 3 years now sort of in a row, we've consistently set a new high watermark on throughput during our second and third quarters particularly each year. So we're getting faster and faster. We think that we're not sort of close to being at the point where we can't get faster. That is to say there's a long -- sort of a lot of runway on our ability to get faster. But I just want to sort of caution on the throughput thing that throughput is something that's very important. We -- and a lot of people come through our doors. It's always important because it's part of good customer service. And it's always important because when our throughput is fast, our food tastes better because our burritos are rolled and assembled and served to customers while they're still hot. But throughput doesn't happen in a vacuum. When we have more pressure on our teams, longer lines, more customers, then it is a time when you see our throughput numbers get better. That being said, throughput doesn't -- if we don't have people come through our doors, there's opportunities on throughput in some stores we're not going fast enough, but you're not going to see as much of an ability to ramp up throughput. So great throughput, over time, will cause, I think, more customers to enjoy Chipotle because they're going to trust that we can get to them more quickly and that it's more of a convenient experience. But great throughput doesn't sort of -- it will not add a comp in a vacuum during any given quarter. You have to have the transactions come through your door."

If you look at what we're doing now, in the past, we've touted what we call our hero ingredients. We talked a lot about naturally raised or responsibly raised meats, local produce, faster rates there, that kind of thing. But there are a number of other competitors who are trying to say similar things. The approach we're taking now is to expand that platform to include essentially what's not in our food, these 800 or so chemical additives, which are used to make processed food that is sold in most fast food. And the fact that Chipotle only has 65 ingredients in our entire -- or 67 ingredients in our entire company is really remarkable. So the new campaign's designed to prove that to people, to show that to them in a very interesting, compelling way. That will further differentiate Chipotle in a way that, frankly, the competitors can't mimic. I mean, you can't take all of this junk out of these other processed menu items in other fast food companies. They just basically can't do it. While they can mimic some of our past marketing, I think it will be very difficult for them to do this. So I expect this new approach to have potential even greater impact than the ones previously."

So I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile some of the commentary. And the other beef I had about marketing is -- so I think in the first half of last year, you had a pretty big increase in marketing dollars, and that seems to have helped along with the certain initiatives that saw the lines really shortened through 2013.

And if you do that and if you look out at the rest of the year, unless when we do things, like we adjust for trading day and things like that, I think the third quarter and the fourth quarter will be tough comparisons.

I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. 2014 was an extraordinary year for our business, and we're off to a strong start in 2015. During the quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $1.1 billion, an increase of 20% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 10.4% and the opening of 49 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $3.88 per share, an increase of 47%. These results are particularly strong considering that we were up against 13.4% same-store sales growth in Q1 last year and faced with harsh winter conditions in much of the country, including many important Chipotle markets. We also saw some challenges related to our decision to stop serving carnitas in some of our restaurants. However, the strength of our business has weathered these challenges and emerged to set us up for a great year in 2015.
Our performance is the direct result of our continued focus on the things that really drive our business, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. We have a strong history of establishing very high standards for food we serve, standards that are very often hard to meet given our requirements for the ingredients we use. We have encountered challenges from time to time since we began our journey to find the very best ingredients we can, and we do not anticipate our recent pork supply issue to be our last one. But our track record of driving positive change in these areas is unprecedented, and we believe these higher-quality ingredients taste better.
In January, we suspended one of our pork suppliers after a supply chain audit found that they were not fully compliant with all of our standards. Our protocol requires that pigs are raised with access to the outdoors or deep bedding in barns and without the use of antibiotics. These differences are in stark contrast to the way conventional pigs are raised. In many cases, they spend their whole lives indoors on hard, flattened floors with no bedding, which we think is inhumane. When we found that one of our suppliers was falling short on some of our requirements, we knew that removing this pork from our supply was the right thing to do. But our decision left us without enough pork, and the resulting outages affected more than 1/3 of our restaurants. While many of our customers were incredibly proud that we took a stand to do what was right, we also knew that there was risks involved and that we would encounter challenges in replacing this supply.
There is very little cushion today in the supply system for pork that meets our standards, and ultimately, the solution requires increasing the number of pigs that are available. This does not happen quickly. Recognizing this near-term supply constraint, we have been looking hard to find more pork that meets our protocols. Our long-term suppliers have partnered with us to increase their output of responsibly raised pork. However, this alone will not be enough to remedy the situation, and our shortage will remain at more than 1/3 of our restaurants as we enter the peak spring and summer periods.
We have also looked at the possibility of adding new suppliers and have explored options to use other types of pork as a way to get more supply. Each of these potential solutions has their own unique complications. That said, we now believe that we have found a solution with a new supplier to help us fill our gap. Our team is conducting on-site visits to inspect all facets of the operation, and we're encouraged by what we have seen so far. At this point, we plan to begin introducing this new pork in some of our restaurants in the coming months. If all goes as planned, we believe that we will be steadily increasing our supply throughout the third quarter and back in full supply during the fourth quarter.
While the commitments we make and the way we run our business can be difficult, they are also helping to differentiate Chipotle and enabling us to build stronger relationships with our customers, particularly younger customers. New research out during the quarter from investment firms shows that the fast-casual sector has surpassed casual dining in terms of frequency of visits with 45% of consumers saying that they spend more money eating out in 2014, up from 37% in 2013 and pointing to gains in popularity among fast-casual restaurants. In this study, Chipotle was named as the favorite restaurant more than any other, with twice as many mentions as the #2 company on the list. Another study shows that millennials, key customers for Chipotle, are eating out at fast-casual restaurants more than Generation Xers or boomers and that their dissatisfaction with traditional fast food is higher than other generations. We believe that the loyalty we are believed -- or that we are building with key customer groups is very much a result of our commitment to doing what is right in addition to the excellent customer service that we provide. As we move closer to resolving the supply issues that have left us short of carnitas, we believe the pieces are in place for us to deliver strong performance throughout the year and to help us continue to change the way people think about eating fast food.

Our ability to continue to deliver excellent results depends on the continued success of the special people culture that we have created at Chipotle. This culture continues to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience while simultaneously allowing us to develop the excellent leaders we will need to accommodate our future growth and help us to maintain our strong unit economic model.
During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our restaurant teams, adding 42 new Restaurateurs and promoting 11 into field leadership roles, either apprentice team leaders, team leaders or area managers. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and develop them to reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we're able to do things in our restaurants that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only are our teams running extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they're also elevating the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an extraordinary dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics.
The strength of our culture is evident in many ways, including through a growing number of individual success stories, as more and more of our people are climbing the ladder from crew to management and to field leadership positions as well. In fact, last year alone, we promoted more than 10,500 people who started as crew into management positions. More than 78% of our Restaurateurs started with us as crew, many having never even worked in a restaurant before.
During the quarter, one particular leader really captured our attention: Montel Millidge [ph], who demonstrated his ability to assemble a team of all top performers and then empower them to achieve high standards in his restaurant, became our youngest Restaurateur ever at only 19 years old. Montel [ph] came to Chipotle 2 years ago discouraged by his first job in a fast food restaurant. He wanted to work in an environment where the circumstances were encouraging and where he saw opportunities to advance, learn and grow. He came to our College Park restaurant in Maryland for an interview and was hired on the spot. He had a group of very strong leaders such as Gaby Portillo, who is now a Restaurateur; and Patricio Aguila, a Restaurateur who's been promoted to field leader and is now actually a team leader at Chipotle. His team immediately recognized that despite not having significant experience, Montel embodied the 13 characteristics of a top performer and the drive to empower others around him.
A year later, he was a service manager working to develop his replacement so he could move to the apprentice role and at 19 years, promoted to General Manager at a new Chipotle restaurant, when we opened in Maryland City. From the beginning, Montel [ph] set his sights on developing a team of all top performers. He then shared his Restaurateur vision with all of them and connected with each person on his team by getting to know them, sharing his own dreams and desires, and demonstrating to them how he could help them become leaders in their own right. Montel's [ph] story is just one of a number of truly inspiring stories of people who come to Chipotle motivated by our food culture and the people culture and who share our vision and work hard to achieve it. These stories really illustrate the opportunities we're offering at Chipotle to top performers who are able to deliver a fantastic customer experience and elevate the people around them to help them reach their potential.
These opportunities are not only very rewarding to those who take advantage of them. They also provide the people that we will need to lead our continued growth at Chipotle. One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which, among other things, generates great throughput. Our teams understand that the qualities that make for great throughput are exactly the same qualities that provide the very best customer service: having everything ready in a restaurant before our customers arrive, so we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, and clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed.
We continue to increase our average transactions throughout the day, including our peak lunch and peak dinner hours. During the quarter, we increased average transactions by 21 across the entire day, a tremendous accomplishment. This continues -- this continued improvement is the product of our outstanding restaurant teams and their ongoing attention to providing better service but also our continued emphasis on the 4 pillars of throughput, which are using a linebacker and dedicated expo at  peak times, proper mise en place and having the very best person in each position on the line during our busiest times. Since we started reporting on the progress our restaurants are making in implementing these 4 pillars, we have seen continued improvement in throughput, which we believe will become increasingly important now as we head into our busiest months of the year.
Finally, on the development front, we are well on track to meet our initial guidance to open 190 to 205 new restaurants during this year. During the quarter, we opened 49 new restaurants, including 1 new ShopHouse, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,831, including 10 ShopHouses and 2 Pizzeria Locales. We continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline and are increasing our mix of new construction deals. Building restaurants in newly constructed centers is less costly for us, so this increase in new developments should help offset some of the higher development cost that we saw in 2014. We're continuing to evaluate new market opportunities for our proceeds and anticipate entering new markets for both ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale this year. We previously announced our plans to introduce Pizzeria Locale in Kansas City and also expect to open in a third market, Cincinnati, later this year.
We're pleased with our results for the quarter and our start to 2015. With a strong food culture, unique and empowering people culture and industry leading in economics, we're well positioned to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

Very early on, we decided to spend more on our ingredients and less on our marketing. It's always been our belief that better-quality food prepared by hand and served by excellent teams would be the most powerful marketing of all. In fact, we were serving better ingredients, including pasture-raised dairy, local produce and meats without antibiotics or hormones long before there was even significant customer demand for such things. Over time, this has created powerful differentiation between Chipotle and other fast food brands. This approach has served us well, and our ongoing marketing research makes us confident that this is the case. Chipotle has become quite buzzworthy with awareness coming from social media, public relations, advertising and our local and event marketing programs but with less reliance on traditional advertising than many of our competitors. The strength of our programs in areas other than advertising generates considerable attention and awareness and does -- as does the break-through nature of our content programs, which have reached well beyond what we would get through traditional advertising.
We are also seeing greater interest among customers who are looking to eat healthier and defining healthy around such characteristics as natural and minimally processed ingredients, exactly the same kind of ingredients we use to make our food. And we are also see that a majority of the customers, about 60%, are willing to pay more for better food, food that is made without artificial ingredients. All of these findings really support the way we run our business and our marketing and all the traits that are reflected in various aspects of our marketing.
The various -- I'm sorry, the vast majority of fast food brands use limited time offers, new menu items and price promotions as their core marketing strategy. These new menu items and offers rarely build long-term loyal customers; instead, only provide a spike in sales during their advertising window. In order to maintain traffic, most fast food brands need to add a steady stream of new menu items throughout the year, resulting in bloated menus filled with hundreds of menu items. Not only is this marketing approach incredibly expensive, the cluttered menus can be confusing to customers and difficult for the restaurant crews to execute. But the most significant downside to this approach is that these new menu items are often made from cheap, artificial ingredients and are highly processed. These menus of highly processed items are proving problematic as customers are increasingly concerned with the long list of artificial ingredients found in foods today. There are more than 800 artificial ingredients, preservatives and processing aids used in processed foods. In fact, there are over -- there are 85 ingredients in a single fast food burrito served by 1 of our competitors.
For years, our marketing has touted the superiority of our ingredients, including our use of local produce, pasture-raised dairy and meats without antibiotics and added hormones, but more recently, we have come to expand our marketing messages to highlight the small number of whole, unprocessed ingredients used in our food. In fact, there are only 68 ingredients used to prepare all of the food we serve at Chipotle. The vast majority of which are simple ingredients you could buy at the local market. Only our tortillas contain any preservatives or other additives, and we are diligently working to eliminate those.
The fact that Chipotle uses better-quality ingredients is well known, but the fact that our food contains virtually none of these artificial ingredients that other fast food contains literally -- and other fast food contains literally hundreds of them will further differentiate Chipotle from the competition. That's why we have developed a new marketing platform called Collective Beauty [ph], which is our internal designation for the program that highlights the simple beauty of the minimal number of whole, unprocessed ingredients in our food. The campaign includes several phases and will be rolled out over the coming years. Currently, the campaign is running in print, outdoor and radio across 30 of our top markets. Additionally, we are running more national advertising than ever before, leveraging print, streaming radio, search and social. The campaign runs in 2 flights, 1 this spring and another this fall. During the summer break between advertising flights, we'll be launching a large online initiative for Collective Beauty [ph] .
Beyond this expansion of our marketing strategy, strengthening our e-commerce programs is a top priority for us this year. Over the last year, we worked on a project to incorporate mobile payment into Chipotle ordering apps. We had hoped that this capability would have been available in the updated app released in December of 2014, but we were not happy with how it was working, particularly in light of the continually evolving landscape of mobile payment. Our commitment to support mobile payments has not changed, but our approach has. We are broadening our view of mobile payment to include more than simply paying for in-restaurant transactions using our app. Our near-term priorities with regard to mobile include the launch of an ordering app for Apple Watch, which will be available Apple 24 (sic) [April 24], and the exploration of new systems for mobile payment, including the use of Apple Pay in our restaurants and our iOS app, and potentially Google Wallet capability within our Android app. We are making progress with all of these initiatives, and we'll keep you apprised as these programs evolve.
Last, we also relaunched our chipotle.com website with better accessibility and functionality for mobile users. Additionally, we have begun delivery of online and mobile orders for individual and small groups in 67 cities using the Postmates delivery app. We selected Postmates as our official delivery partner in March, and now they are currently delivering Chipotle orders in all of the markets where they operate.
Finally, with regard to our catering programs, we will begin advertising catering in a number of markets as we get close to graduation season, historically a busy season for catering packages, and expect to see continued momentum in this area during that peak time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack."

We're very proud of our results for the quarter as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or a 20% increase as compared to last year, and EPS was up 47% in the quarter. Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark",1975,"Thanks, Mark. We're very proud of our results for the quarter as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or a 20% increase as compared to last year, and EPS was up 47% in the quarter. Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark for the first time, and it was just a little more than 3 years ago that our average volumes passed $2 million for the first time, meaning that we've been able to increase our average volumes by more than $500,000 per restaurant while adding more than 600 new restaurants during the past 3 years. This obviously has had a significant positive effect on our unit economics, and it means we're serving more -- Chipotle to more and more people in new and existing restaurants as we pursue our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
As you know, this year, we faced the most difficult comp comparisons we've ever had as a public company, including lapping the menu price increase from Q2 of last year. We're pleased with the 10.4% comp in the quarter on top of the 13.4% comp from last year, and we believe the comp was affected by weather especially in parts of the Mid-Atlantic, the northeast and regions in the south and by the pork shortage, which Steve talked about. It's difficult to put a precise impact on the combined effect of weather and the pork shortage during the quarter, but we believe the comp could have been as much as 100 to 200 basis points higher with normalized weather and had we been able to serve carnitas in all of our restaurants.
And it's not possible to separate the weather impact from the effect of the pork shortage since they happened at roughly the same time. We normally talk about weather not having a net impact on our sales, as our sales typically come roaring back after a big snowstorm, offsetting the lower sales caused by the storm. But the weather impact this year lasted for many weeks in most markets, so any sales bounce-back could not affect -- not offset the full effect of the bad weather. Our comps were highest in January and lowest in March, similar to some macro retail trends and consistent with the premise that the weather was likely a factor in February and March. And sales so far in April are trending slightly higher than March, which tells us that weather was at least partially a factor in the first quarter.
So what does all that mean for our sales trends going forward? Well, comps in April, so far, appear on track to be in the high single digits, and we think our pork shortage is currently impacting our sales by as much as 200 basis points. We did not see an immediate impact on sales in markets where we first ran out of pork, but our research and our sales analysis suggest that our carnitas customers really love our pork, and they appear to be visiting less often or not at all until they know we have carnitas again in their market. Now this is not surprising as the vast majority of our customers tend to find their favorite burrito or favorite bowl combination, and then they order that favorite meal every single time they visit. We had hoped that the shortage would encourage our carnitas customers to try another menu option, and some did, but many have decided to hold out until carnitas returns to their market.
And as a reminder, we rotate the markets without pork about every 6 weeks, and so every 1 of our markets has been affected at some time or another. We found that when we rotated supply back to a particular market, it can take weeks before our carnitas product mix returns to the previous product mix levels as a result of our carnitas-loving customers not realizing we were back in supply of carnitas, and so they visited less often. In other words, this rolling blackout has caused confusion among our customers about where and when we were out of carnitas, and this has worsened the sales impact.
Because of this phenomenon, we're going to stop the rolling blackout and continuously serve carnitas in our markets where the carnitas product mix tends to be the highest starting later this month. Based on actual April trends and factoring the tougher comparisons in May and June, including the lapping of last year's menu price increase, Q2 comps overall are likely to be in the low to mid-single digits, so that comp assumes that we continue to see as much as a 200 basis points negative impact on the pork shortage. As Steve mentioned, we expect additional pork to be returning to our restaurants beginning in the third quarter with a full return of carnitas during the fourth quarter. It also assumes no incremental menu price increase in Q2 related to the elevated beef prices, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. That also is before any potential sales lift we might get from our marketing campaign that Mark talked about or from other impacts such as faster throughput.
By the way, of the 10.4% comp in the quarter, about 6.1% relates to the price increase from last year, and most of the rest was due to higher traffic with a small increase in average check due to positive mix, including greater group size and catering. Of course, we're as disappointed as our carnitas-loving customers that we have not been able to satisfy their craving, and we don't love the fact that our sales have been impacted by the shortage. But we remain committed to our food integrity mission, and we are as confident as ever that we made the right decision to suspend the pork supplier based on our animal welfare protocols. And we're optimistic that the new pork suppliers we talked about will help us at least reduce the impact of the shortage on our customers and on our sales soon.
Overall for the year, we continue to expect comps in the low to mid-single digits, which is consistent with the outlook we initially provided for the year. And again, this does not factor in any menu price increases related to beef or any sales recovery from eliminating the pork shortage.
We're pleased to finally see some relief on our food cost line with food cost declining from 35% in the fourth quarter to 33.9% in Q1. The main contributor to the decrease were from relief in dairy cost and favorable pricing for avocados. Dairy pricing had largely been expected to be realized as the broader commodity market increased supply during the fourth quarter of 2014, and the trend was relatively stable throughout the quarter. With avocado pricing, we have observed a slight increase in supply, and that has temporarily helped to keep the prices reasonable through the early months of 2015. However, we anticipate that normal seasonal shifts will pressure the avocado market in Q2 and Q3 as we buy more avocados from California growers.
Beef prices remain at historically high levels, although beef inflation was largely contained during the quarter. We currently believe that the pricing for beef will remain at these elevated levels well into 2016 and perhaps even into 2017. As a result of this increased inflation, we expect to raise prices on steak and barbacoa this year, most likely by the end of the third quarter. And while we're still carefully reviewing our options, we anticipate an average increase of around 4% to 6%, which would have a net effect of about 150 basis points based on the current product mix of our steak and barbacoa. And as you'll recall, our intent last year was to cover the inflationary cost pressures of beef, but we undershopped this level in hindsight as beef costs continue to rise. Now while it's important to our vision that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers, we also want to charge our customers the going rate for the ingredients that we use. And as a reminder, we saw virtually no trade down from steak and barbacoa last year, when we increased prices for these entrées more than other menu items.
One final note related to food cost in the quarter, we included a one-time write-off to the cost of sales associated with the carnitas inventory of $1.7 million. We chose to donate rather than serve the pork, which did not meet our protocols. This write-off was offset by a small change in the classification of miscellaneous kitchen supplies, which shifted from the food cost line to the other operating cost during the quarter.
Labor costs for the first quarter were 22.4% of sales, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Leverage for the quarter was largely driven by higher sales volumes, which include the benefit of the higher menu prices, and that was slightly offset by wage inflation. Occupancy costs were 5.8% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points from last year, and other operating costs were 10.4% of sales or 10 basis points lower than last year. Marketing expenses during the quarter were 0.9% of sales compared to 1.3% in the prior year, and it's in line with expectations and lower than our full year outlook as we will ramp up additional marketing costs during Q2 and Q3 related to the campaign that Mark discussed.
Restaurant level margins increased 160 basis points to 27.5%, benefiting from strong revenue growth compared to last year. G&A was 5.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 7.4% last year, and it was driven by the lower noncash stock comp. For the full year 2015, we expect noncash stock comp expense to be about $80 million, which is down $18 million from last year. Executive comp was restructured, resulting in an estimated $33 million reduction in executive comp for the full, while additional grants to restaurant management and staff are expected to offset the noncash stock comp by about $15 million. Total stock comp in the first quarter was about $16.6 million compared to about $27.6 million last year.
As Mark mentioned earlier, we are refocusing our e-commerce program to build a mobile platform that moves beyond simply incorporating mobile payment into our ordering app. We incurred a loss on the disposal of assets of about $2.8 million associated with some of the prior development work.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.4%, and for full year, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.7% compared to 37.6% for the full year in 2014. 2014 benefited from our estimated usable federal and state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credits, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points.
We finished the quarter with 1,831 restaurants, and our average unit volumes have helped push our return on investment up to nearly 80%, an economic return that we're very proud to achieve. As of March 31, we held cash and investments of about $1.4 billion, including short- and long-term interest-bearing investments, and we continue to have no debt on our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $23 million of our stock on average share price of $675, and we currently have $179 million remaining on our share buyback program, which was previously approved by our board. We continue to believe that reinvesting into the growth of our business remains the best use of our cash, although we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.

We just know others, when they're on the high single digits, low double digits, that gives us optimism that we can move that number up from the 6.6% today."

I think when you combine years, you have to combine years that make up the full trend that we're seeing, and in our case, I'd go back to the current trend we're in. We're in the third year of a trend that started in early 2013. And if you remember, our comp in 2013 was 1%, and the year before that, we were on a kind of a deceleration as we were finishing up a 3-year trend that started in 2010. And so if you go back to 2013 and you look, we grew comps from 1% and then 5%, then 6%, then 9% and went to double digits, and now we're comparing against those strong double digits. And I think if you combine those 3 years together, you'll see a 3-year trend that for the first quarter, with 2015 being the third year, the comp was about 24.8%. Now we know that was affected by weather and pork, and so it was suppressed a little bit. But if you make an adjustment for weather and pork. I think for the rest of the year, you can think in terms of a 3-year combined sales comp, and that would put you in kind of the 25%, 26% range or so. And I think that's a better way to think about it. So in those terms, I think that we should stay in that same kind of ballpark. And again, that doesn't take into account anything we do with menu prices on beef, and it doesn't take in any -- into account the replenishment of supply with the pork that Steve talked about later in the year."

The fact that we've added $500,000 in volume while adding the 600 restaurants I talked about, over the last 3 years, I think is pretty substantial. If you go back to the 3 years before that, that was a 3-year trend as well. That had a start and a stop, and it was pretty clean 2010, '11 and '12, during that 3-year period. And you can see where it started. You can see where it ended, and that was about a 27% or 28% or 29% increase. And so we seem to have these waves, and then if you go back even as we were a private company, these waves where people figure out that Chipotle exists, they like it. They come back more often. And so we have this kind of surge, and then we have a leveling off and then a surge and a leveling off. Very tough to predict will we have another surge, when will we have it, what will the magnitude of that surge be. But we continue to believe that there's a great appreciation and a growing appreciation for what we do at Chipotle. We do think millennials, in particular, are very appreciative of what we do. We think this campaign that's designed to reinforce the idea that not only do we source sustainably raised ingredients but we do real cooking with real whole ingredients, and we largely don't use things like preservatives and stabilizers and things like that. So we believe that, that is not something that is short-lived, that's over. We think that we'll probably benefit from that. But in terms of then breaking that down into exactly what that's going to do for the next 2 or 3 quarters, it's tougher to predict, and the comparisons are tough.

We're also, as Jeff mentioned, I think, in our last earnings call, doing a large data project at Chipotle, which will give us even more capability in terms of reaching out to these folks, but we have seen a shift in our marketing toward more one-to-one marketing in terms of what we're spending anyway. So I think we're already underway in that regard."

Like I said, we think we can continue to go faster as the pressure of a busy second and third quarter comes to us. Over the last couple of years, even 3 years now sort of in a row, we've consistently set a new high watermark on throughput during our second and third quarters particularly each year. So we're getting faster and faster. We think that we're not sort of close to being at the point where we can't get faster. That is to say there's a long -- sort of a lot of runway on our ability to get faster. But I just want to sort of caution on the throughput thing that throughput is something that's very important. We -- and a lot of people come through our doors. It's always important because it's part of good customer service. And it's always important because when our throughput is fast, our food tastes better because our burritos are rolled and assembled and served to customers while they're still hot. But throughput doesn't happen in a vacuum. When we have more pressure on our teams, longer lines, more customers, then it is a time of year you're going to see our throughput numbers get better. That being said, throughput doesn't -- if we don't have people come through our doors, there's opportunities on throughput in some stores where we're not going fast enough, but you're not going to see as much of an ability to ramp up throughput. So great throughput, over time, will cause, I think, more customers to enjoy Chipotle because they're going to trust that we can get them through more quickly and that it's more of a convenient experience. But great throughput doesn't sort of -- it will not add a comp in a vacuum during any given quarter. You have to have the transactions come through your door."

If you look at what we're doing now, in the past, we've touted what we call our hero ingredients. We talked a lot about naturally raised or responsibly raised meats, local produce, pasture-raised dairy, that kind of thing. But there are a number of other competitors who are trying to say similar things. The approach we're taking now is to expand that platform to include essentially what's not in our food, these 800 or so chemical additives which are used to make processed food that is sold in most fast food. And the fact that Chipotle only has 65 ingredients in our entire -- or 67 ingredients in our entire company is really remarkable. So the new campaign's designed to prove that to people, to show that to them in a very interesting, compelling way. That will further differentiate Chipotle in a way that, frankly, the competitors can't mimic. I mean, you can't take all of this junk out of these other processed menu items in other fast food companies. They just -- they just can't do it. While they can mimic some of our past marketing, I think it will be very difficult for them to do this. So I expect this new approach to have potential even greater impact than the ones previously."

I'm pleased with our performance during the second quarter and first half of 2015. On the heels of what was arguably our best year ever as a public company in 2014, we have continued to post strong results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 14.1% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and the opening of 48 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.45 per share, an increase of 27.1%. 
These results are particularly strong considering the very difficult comparisons we faced and keep us on pace with the guidance we provided for 2015.
The strength of our business is the result of our focus on our unique food and people cultures. And in an increasingly crowded and competitive industry, these unique and compelling attributes continue to differentiate Chipotle and drive our success. During the quarter, we took a significant step to improve this food we serve when we completed our transition to using only non-GMO ingredients to make all the food we serve in our restaurants. We began this effort 2 years ago when we made the decision to voluntarily disclose the GMOs in our ingredients. Following that move, we worked to eliminate the limited number of GMO ingredients we were using to make our food, which included soybean oil and some ingredients in our tortillas. Today all the food we serve at Chipotle restaurants is made with non-GMO ingredients.
While that decision was made with some criticism, most of which was tied to the notion that GMO foods do not present any health risks to people who consume them. A majority of the response to our decision was overwhelmingly positive, and we believe it was the right thing to do for a number of reasons: First, we believe that a few GMO ingredients that were on our menu were not making our food any better in any way; second, that there was considerable debate about long-term impacts associated with GMO farming systems; and third, that more research is necessary to fully understand the impacts of GMO foods, particularly studies that are long term and independent in nature. 
Our position on GMOs very much aligns with consumer sentiment on this issue, and quite simply, Chipotle is the only national chain where consumers can eat anything on the menu without worry about eating GMOs. 
This direction is not new for us, and the decision is very consistent with our overall culture of serving Food with Integrity. There are a number of ingredients that have been declared safe to eat, including artificial flavorings and colorings, for example, that are also not in our food. 
Simply because something is deemed safe doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it makes our food better in anyway. With our food now made entirely from non-GMO ingredients, we have set our sights on making better tortillas. These are seasonal tortillas are made using only 5 ingredients: flour, water, starter, vegetable oil and salt. And when you consider that the starter, which is the leavening agent, is made from flour and water, it's really just 4 ingredients. While this might sound like a relatively simple undertaking, it's actually quite a challenge because one has to account for a number of variables: moisture in the flour, temperature and humidity in the bakery, strength of the starter, et cetera. And many of the chemical additives in commercial tortillas are designed to mitigate these variabilities. So while our tortillas necessitate the keen eye and hand of our bakers, we know that skilled bakers can make better-tasting tortillas more similar to homemade tortillas than we currently get at commercial scale. 
Tortillas made commercially generally contain artificial additives, including preservatives, to extend their shelf life, and dough condition to give them strength and the ability to stretch in order to eliminate the need for natural fermentation process of the dough. The new tortillas are working -- the new tortillas we are working to develop through a partnership with Washington State University's bread lab would have no artificial ingredients but rather will have only a few real whole ingredients that have traditionally been used to make tortillas. 
Returning to this fresher, simpler tortilla essentially requires that we reinvent the way tortillas are made on a large scale, and that's exactly what we're doing. While we're in the very early stages of this project, the tortillas that we're making are delicious and performed very well. Later this fall, we'll be scaling the project up for continued testing. This is consistent with our overall Food with Integrity mission, one that respects the environment, farmers, the bakers, our customers' health, and ultimately, their taste buds. 
We have also made significant progress to resolve our pork shortage, which began in January. As you likely recall, we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers with a routine audit found that the supplier was not adhering to all facets of our animal welfare protocol. We have found a new supplier of the U.K. and have begun serving pork in most of our Florida restaurants, a little over 100 restaurants in total. 
While it has always been our preference to source meats domestically, the quantity of pork that meets our standards is simply not available right now from domestic suppliers as the vast majority of pork raised in the United States, more than 95% based on our estimates, is not raised to our standards. The pork we are getting from Kerry Foods meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards, including that this pork comes from pigs that are born on pasture and raised in deeply bedded barns. However, adheres to a different antibiotic protocol. Under program, pigs can be given antibiotics under a veterinary supervision and can remain in the supply. What is important to note is that antibiotics cannot be use subtherapeutically to promote growth at Caro. This program is common in the U.K. and has been endorsed by a number of animal welfare, scientific and veterinary organizations in the United States. 
During the coming months, we'll be sourcing more pork from Caro and returning carnitas to the restaurants around the country on a market-by-market basis until we're fully supplied again, which we expect to happen before the end of the year. We knew when we made the decision to suspend pork -- to suspend the pork supplier that it would leave us without enough pork for all of our restaurants and that our decision could impact customers' perceptions of Chipotle and have an impact on our sales. We are extremely pleased by the reaction from our customers, many of whom applauded us for taking this principled stand. As we see continue to ramp up our pork supply, we expect to regain any lost sales tied to this outage. 
We're making these changes to improve our ingredients as we continue on our Food with Integrity journey. For more than 15 years, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. In recent months, a number of food companies have made pledges to remove some artificial ingredients from their food, primarily things like artificial colors and preservatives. This reality, however, is that these ingredients make up only a portion of the thousands of additives used in processed foods. Aside from our tortillas, none of our foods include any of these additives. With competitors making big pledges, we're strengthening our marketing message to continue to show the contrast between what Chipotle has always done and the changes others are pledging. We've always and will continue to make our food with the very best ingredients we can find. And once our tortilla project is complete, we will not rely on any of the artificial ingredients that are so prevalent in processed foods. 
To highlight this differentiation, today we launched a new program called Friends or Faux, spelled F-A-U-X, which is an integrated campaign that includes an interactive digital game that invites customers to learn about the difference between Chipotle's ingredients and those commonly used to make fast food and processed packaged foods. To play the game, consumers choose a Chipotle menu item and a representative traditional fast food item, and they compare and match the ingredients, identifying which items contain which ingredients. The online game will include a limited-time BOGO promotion for participants while encouraging customers to learn more about Food with Integrity mission. 
In addition to the game, the campaign is also supported by extensive online advertising, which begins today.
Constantly working to improve the quality and taste of the food we serve is embedded in our culture, and our track record to improve our food is unmatched in the industry. With the strength of our food culture and a unique and compelling people culture that further separates Chipotle from other restaurant companies, we believe we have the pieces in place to continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our very special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are providing a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience while also running the restaurants in the way that helps us maintain a strong unit economic model. 
Having the best teams requires that we provide extraordinary opportunities for our people. The most unique benefit that we provide is the opportunity for our people to develop into the most effective leaders they can be with the most rewarding career possible, and this is at the core of our culture. But we also invest in benefits and compensation packages that match the talent of our teams. 
During the quarter, a number of up-and-coming leaders took advantage of new opportunities as we promoted 39 managers into Restaurateur positions and also promoted 16 new field leaders, including 9 apprentice team leaders, 3 team leaders and 2 team directors. These promotions come to expect at Chipotle. Currently more than 90% of our restaurant managers come from within the ranks of our crew, and we have promoted 5,900 people who started as crew into management positions just this year, on top of the 10,500 people who started as crew and were promoted in the management positions last year. 
With our strong ability to develop our leaders from within and the importance of establishing a Restaurateur culture in all of our restaurants, our people culture continues to be a primary asset leading to our growth, and it also gives us a great optimism that we will continue to experience strong growth going forward.
The leaders we are developing are able to attract other talented people to our company and are deeply committed to having these new people reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we are able to do things that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only do our teams run extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they also elevate the people around them. This approach to running a restaurant is what enables us to create such an outstanding dining experience and to deliver such a strong unit economics. 
To help perpetuate our culture and the development of our top performers, we held a meeting during the quarter with field leaders, some of them new to the company and others with long careers here, to discuss and clarify the rule of all field leaders at Chipotle. We were pleased how committed our leaders are to the concept of achieving success by making others better. Our field leaders see more clearly now than never that their success depends on the success of the people they lead. There's no ambiguity as to the priorities we have for our leaders at Chipotle. They know that their job is to develop Restaurateurs, and they have a very clear understanding as to how to do that. 
We've told our field leaders that we define their success by looking at 3 things: first, that each general manager that they lead must know exactly why they're not a Restaurateur; second, each of their general managers must be able to clearly state exactly what their plan is to become a Restaurateur and what their priorities are in order to do so; third, the general managers must actually developing into Restaurateurs. 
The most important tool field leaders have to help them succeed in this task is the Restaurateur diagnosis and plan tool. Using this tool allows our a field leaders to uncover the positive and negative teams that may exist in each restaurant and to make a specific plan for how to best eliminate those negative teams. With the tool now well established, field leaders are using it as the basis for each visit to a restaurant, and with the proper progress updates, it is allowing our field leaders to chart the development path for Restaurateur cultures with each visit and each revision to the plan serving as a new chapter in the development story for the general manager. Of course, all of these stories should have the same ending, another team establishing a Restaurateur culture and adding to our group of elite leaders who are changing the way people think about and eat fast food. 
During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our compensation and benefits programs, particularly at the crew level. We completed the first installment of our twice-annual merit increases for per crew and made a onetime compensation adjustment for our kitchen managers and service managers to ensure compensation for those positions is consistent with the very high expectations that these rules carry. 
We also made improvements to the benefits we offer hourly crew by increasing paid vacation and adding paid sick days and by extending our tuition reimbursement program to include hourly employees in addition to the salary managers to whom this benefit was already available. 
One of the greatest benefits of having a strong culture in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which generates great throughput. Our teams understand the qualities that make for great throughput are the same qualities that provide the very best customer service. Having everything ready in the restaurant before customers arrives so that we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, as well as clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed. 
During the quarter, we held a national throughput competition to emphasize the importance of the 4 pillars in our restaurants. We achieved a number of new 1-hour throughput records by reiterating the fundamentals of throughput, and we continued to increase the number of restaurants that are implementing the 4 pillars during our peak dinner periods. As a result, we were able to largely maintain the substantial gains we made during 2014 to our throughput during our peak lunch and dinner hours. This is significant because last year was a tremendous year in which we delivered double-digit transaction comps that created a very tough comparison for this year. 
Our Restaurateurs continue to find opportunities to improve our standards and increase throughput, and we know that we're in a stronger position today as we are better prepared to utilize the 4 pillars to provide a more favorable customer experience. 
Finally, on the development front. We are well on track throughout the first half of the year towards our guidance of opening 190 to 205 new restaurants. Actually, the pace of openings during the first half of the year gives us confidence that we'll finish 2015 at or above the high end of our guidance range for the full year. During the second quarter, we opened 48 new restaurants. That's a total of 97 so far for the year, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,878. After the end of the quarter, we also opened 1 new restaurant in London, where Chipotle continues to build a strong customer base. We're at the first week of opening of our seventh restaurant in the U.K. Our team has already beat the existing U.K. throughput record with 229 transactions during its peak lunch hour, which is very encouraging. And finally, Canada's performance has been so successful we no longer consider it to be a growth seed but rather a growth strategy. This means we now view Canada as a proven market, and we look to accelerate our pace of development in Canadian markets over the next year. 
We also just completed the second of our 3 festivals for the year as the most recent festival concluded in Kansis City last weekend. This year's event in Kansas City was a terrific success, and consumers are able to try out Pizzeria Locale at the festival and at our new restaurant opening tomorrow in Kansas City. We continue to further develop our growth seeds with a Pizzeria Locale opening in Cincinatti and a new ShopHouse to open in Chicago. So in the third quarter, we're in a great position from a development perspective, and we continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline. 
We're excited about our results for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. With a strong food culture unique, a unique and empowering people culture and the best unit economics in the industry, we are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and we're delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,303105063,835337,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Monty.

We're proud of our performance for the first half of 2015 in which we continue to have positive comp sales on annual restaurant volumes that now average more than $2.5 million each. While our comparison this year are the toughest we have faced as a public company, I'm confident that our top-performing teams will continue to attract more customers as they prepare and serve delicious food made from high-quality ingredients. 
I've been very active since our last earnings call visiting 5 of our 8 regions and spending time with our field leadership and restaurant teams and promoting 17 new Restaurateurs during that time, which gives me great confidence that we have a strong bench of up-and-coming future leaders to support our growth. 
Our sales increased 14.1% in the quarter to $1.2 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a sales comp of 4.3%, which is right in line with the Q2 guidance of low to mid-single-digits we provided in April. The comp was driven mainly by our pricing last year, which contributed 4% to the comp. We've now fully lapped the pricing in the second quarter of 2014, so the 4% pricing benefit we enjoyed in Q2 is gone. 
sales transaction counts in July so far remain a positive territory in the low single digits. We're still without pork in about 40% of our restaurants today, but July sales are benefiting slightly by about 60 basis points from a targeted price increase on steak and barbacoa. As we discussed during prior earnings calls, we decided to take this targeted menu price increase in steak and barbacoa as beef pricing remains at historically high levels, and our menu price gap between steak and barbacoa versus other entrées did not cover this higher cost. The average increase was just about 4% or about $0.30 per entrée. 
We've not yet increased beef prices in about 40% of our restaurants, which have not been resupplied with carnitas. We held off in those markets as we want to avoid the unintended consequence of having customers trade from carnitas to steak or barbacoa and then be forced to pay more for their meal. Our intention is to raise beef prices in these markets once carnitas is back in supply. The price increase was effective earlier this month. And while it's still early, we have not seen any resistance so far. 
For the full year, we continue to expect comps to be in the low to mid-single digits, including the price increase on beef I just discussed. This assumes our comps remains in the low single digits for the rest of this year. As Steve mentioned, we recently added a new pork supplier, and we hope to be back in full supply of carnitas in all markets by early in Q4. In April, we estimated the pork shortage may have impacted our comps by as much as 200 basis points, and we believe the net impact for Q2 was in line with this estimate. And while we're optimistic that bringing pork back to all markets will help our comp, we have not included any bounce back related to carnitas in our guidance. 
Restaurant-level margins increased 70 basis points to 28%, among our highest margins as a public company despite being a less-than-stellar quarter for our labor execution. The higher margins were driven by our lower food cost at 33.1%, which were 150 basis points better than last year and 80 basis points better than the first quarter. The lower food costs are tied to our menu price increase in last year along with lower pricing for dairy and avocados as lower dairy was driven by continued strong production and a strengthening U.S. dollar, and the avocado supply is benefited from an increased harvest of Mexican avocado. 
Beef cost held relatively stable in the quarter, but remained substantially elevated from historical levels and added nearly 100 basis points to our food cost compared to last year. We hope our food cost can remain at about this level through the back half of the year, but we do expect some pressure from avocados as we purchase more from the California growers and perhaps also from beef, which has been difficult to predict and could remain volatile. 
Labor cost were 22.6% of sales during the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year. While labor rates are increasing at a faster rate than they have in a very long time, which I'll talk about a little later, the majority of this higher labor relates to ineffective labor scheduling and execution. We were hampered during the quarter by an interruption in our labor management reporting as a result of implementing a new workforce enterprise system. Our investment in our operational systems are a long-term investment that will allow for a more effective scheduling in the future but is not without some short-term hurdles that can be typical of these integration efforts. This has caused us to temporarily lose some oversight of our labor scheduling. We've now reestablished most of the management reporting now. And so far, in July, we recaptured about half of the opportunity or about 40 basis points, and we expect to capture the rest of the opportunity during the third quarter. So the third quarter we still have somewhat elevated labor as we are recapturing the loss labor efficiency throughout this quarter, but we expect to be back to normal for all of Q4. We believe this labor challenge has negatively impacted EPS during the second quarter by about $0.16. 
While we're disappointed with our labor execution, our field teams are committed to bring our labor back in line quickly. And they're going well beyond that to ensure that all of our restaurant managers and our field leaders become experts at writing and executing great schedules so our labor deployment will be great with or without the availability of oversight reporting in the future. So I'm confident we will fully recapture this opportunity. 
Hourly labor rates, including our hourly managers, increased 4.2% in the quarter, the fastest we have seen in many years. There has been a general increase in wage rates in many of our markets. And because we desire and expect to attract and reward only top performers, very important for us to stay ahead of the curve and pay attractive starting wages. We also continually monitor the pay of our top performers restaurants as they progress through the manager rank to ensure we're paying fair wages in light of their significant contributions, and so this is also a contributing factor to the increase in the quarter. 
As Monty mentioned, we also enhanced the benefits offered to our crew by adding a tuition reimbursement program and by paying for sick time and increasing the vacation pay. By far, the greatest benefit we offer to our people is the significant opportunity to advance in their leadership positions within Chipotle. But these enhancements represent important investments to ensure we're attracting, retaining and elevating the very best people into these leadership positions. We know that our special people culture with the Restaurateurs as the centerpiece leads to better dining experience for our customers, better-tasting food, faster throughput, the development of extraordinary future leaders, better business results and ultimately, the creation of shareholder value. So it's important to know that improving our special people culture occurs through great leadership and having a Restaurateur vision and cannot simply be bought by throwing additional dollars at our team, but a key component of our people culture is to attract and retrain great people. So we make these investments knowing it will make our company stronger. 
We expect the incremental cost of these investments to be about $2.5 million incrementally on a quarterly basis beginning in the third quarter. 
We typically pay above-minimum wage in all of our markets, so a normal increase in local wages usually has little effect on us. But in some local markets, the minimum wage has been or soon will be pushed well above our national average rate. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the minimum wage was recently increased over $12 an hour. This increase, coupled with higher occupancy and other operating cost, excluding food cost, contribute to an overall cost of doing business up 30% or more compared to 30% or more higher than our average Chipotle. But our menu prices in the San Francisco area were, until recently, only about 4% above the typical Chipotle or lower than most competitors in the area. So as a result of looking at all of these factors, we decided we were underpriced in San Francisco, and we recently increased prices by 10% in the 10 restaurants within San Francisco and by 7% for the 74 restaurants outside San Francisco in the Bay Area. These relatively modest increases effectively pass along only some of the higher cost of doing business in that area. 
Because only 84 restaurants were affected, the impact on the overall company will be about 30 basis points on an annual basis. 
We'll take a similar approach when the overall cost of doing business in our market escalating on a case-by-case basis. Whether these higher costs are driven by changes or market forces. As an example, although the minimum wage Maryland recently increased over $10 an hour, our overall cost of doing business are reasonable there. And so we do not plan to increase our pricing those restaurants. Our objective will always be to keep our menu accessible to our customers while being able to recruit the best people we can with competitive wages in each market and also while considering the overall cost of doing business and competitor prices in the area. 
Cost for the quarter were 5.4% of sales, flat compared to last year. Other operating costs were 10.9% during the quarter, down 10 basis points from 2014. Marketing was 1.8% during the quarter, slightly lower than the second quarter of last year. And we continue to expect our marketing expense to be around 1.7% of sales overall for the year. 
G&A was 5.9% in the quarter, down 120 basis points from the prior year due to lower noncash stock comp expense. Full year noncash stock comp is expected to be slightly below the $80 million we previously forecasted, and this expense will be more evenly weighted throughout the year.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.8%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014. 
Last year benefited from an increase in the estimated useful stay credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credits, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.45, an increase of 27.1%. We finished the second quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term and long-term interest-bearing investments, and no debt on our balance sheet. Since our last earnings call on April 21 and through yesterday, we invested more than $100 million to repurchase nearly 164,000 shares of our stock at an average share price of $621. This was more than 4x the dollar amount invested during the first quarter and nearly 5x the number of shares purchased during Q1 when the average purchase price was $675. And this is a good example of what we mean by being optimistic when the timing -- with the timing and the magnitude of our share buybacks. While we continue to believe investing in our high-returning restaurants remains the best use of our cash, we'll also continue to invest in repurchasing our stock. And today we announced that our board has authorized investment of an additional $100 million to repurchase our stock, which brings our current unused authorization as of yesterday to $170 million. Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions."

That's another initiative that we're working on, which we expect will have an impact. With regard to loyalty, that's a tricky subject. We've studied this in depth, and we don't believe the general supposition that loyalty will make less-frequent customers more frequent. We've studied that and just simply don't believe that to be true. However, what you said is true in that you learn a tremendous amount of information about your customers. And so we're planning on doing but not through a traditional loyalty program but rather through mobile payment. So we will provide our customers at sometime various options through which they can pay for their food, and we will capture data from that whether that's through a third-party or through the ability to use our own gift cards.

So low single digits comp would imply that we're going to delever on the labor line. The rest of the P&L, a low single-digit comp, it depends on whether it's a 1 or a 3. If it's in the 3 range, 2 or 3 range, unless there's something unusual with energy cost or something unusual which would affect utilities, we should be okay. We should be able to about hold the rest of the cost on our P&L as a percentage of sales. So it really comes down to labor. Now keep in mind, we did announce all these benefits. And so regardless of the comp, we are going to see an incremental $2.5 million added to both the third question and fourth quarter, and that will continue as an additional cost of providing the benefits. And so that will cause some slight delevering as well."

And so that's going to be a price increase that will be in the ballpark of this 4%. And our beef, our steak and barbacoa is somewhere in the 30% range in terms of the product mix. So we're right now running about 60 basis points of incremental comp because of raising prices on beef. When we roll the rest of the 40%, that will get us somewhere in the 100, 110 basis points or something like that. And then any other things that we do related to local cost of doing business, I would expect to be relatively modest. The example I gave you was San Francisco and the Bay Area. That adds an additional 30 basis points. There's not much else going on really between now and the end of the year, so I would say we're going to be between the, if you take the 60 on the higher cost of steak and barbacoa, add the 30 from San Francisco, that's 90, there might be another 30, 40 basis points or so that will roll in over the next several months. And that would be about it for this year. There's some additional structural cost, higher cost of doing business that we will look at next year like we did in San Francisco. But just because minimum wage is increasing in any market doesn't mean we're going to raise prices. The example that I gave in Maryland is a great example. Another one is in Chicago. Chicago just recently implemented higher minimum wage, and we don't expect to raise prices there in the near future, probably not at all this year. So we'll look at it market by market, and there might be some cases where when you look at all of our cost of doing business that we might deem that it's necessary to take a price increase in those markets. But I wouldn't expect that to be a significant add-on to our comp or a significant add on to the menu price increase."

Karen, we have done a very thorough analysis of kind of the traditional loyalty programs.

What we found is we've been able to build loyalty through more organic methods by encouraging people to learn more about Chipotle, by interest about how food is raised, by having them come in to Chipotle and treated to an extraordinary dining experience. And so we've seen our loyalty go up over the years, and we think that's a better way to do it than putting in a structural framework that we didn't think was going to be profitable at all and -- or maybe would be a breakeven or extraordinary comp to make it up.

But on the data side, you're absolutely right. That's what we want, and we believe we can achieve perhaps not the same level of granularity in the information but enough information through a payment system that will give us what we want essentially without the downsides of the certainly ongoing weight of the loyalty program.

I think the best -- the most important thing we can do is to have concepts that really resonate with customers. And we spend -- have spend a lot of time refining the Pizzeria Locale concept. We've gone through a couple of iterations of dough, and we think we have perfected it now. It's really excellent, and that's been in the restaurants now for a couple of months. And we feel confident that as we start with this dough in 2 new markets, in Kansas City and in Cincinnati, Kansas City just in a couple of days on Wednesday, actually tomorrow and then Cincinnati in the fall, that we're going to prove to customers that our pizza, our dough, our method of this new way to serve pizza is superior to the competition out there. How long it takes to lap their sales volumes? I don't know.

And these teams can deliver high standards in every single way. So that's still and always will be the vast majority of where our attention goes. We are testing chorizo in a market right now in Kansas City. We'll -- it's early. We've only had it in market for several weeks right now. We just this week marketing and started advertising. If that's something that  looks like it's either attracting new customers or it's encouraging existing customers to visit more often, that might move up in the priority list. If all chorizo does is take our existing customers and split them among additional menu items, that will be less appealing to us because that just means we have more menu items serving the same customers, and that makes it more complicated and more difficult to serve all these delicious food. So I come back to in terms of priority, the difference between a great running Restaurateur restaurant with an amazing team compared to one that has a lot of teams that Monty talked about the a restaurant that has a lot of teams and they have some low performers on the team and empowerment is not great, the difference in the quality and taste of the food, the difference in how clean that restaurant is, just the difference in when you walk in, you feel like you're welcomed by a team of people that know you and are glad you're there, the difference when you compare that experience to a restaurant that doesn't have performers, that doesn't have the culture of empowerment is dramatic. And we believe that that's the single biggest thing we can do to build our sales over time. The other thing with marketing is we still believe that or we still know that there's lots of people that have never been to Chipotle. Something like 35% or 40% of people have never been to Chipotle. We know that when we study our existing customers that there's like 55% of our customers only some a couple of times a year. And so they're -- the more we can educate and entertain and things like this BOGO where if we can entice customers that don't come very often, once or twice a year, to learn more about our ingredients versus competitors, traditional fast food and get a BOGO to entice them to come in and that cause them to say, oh my God, I mean, I am in 6 months this food is delicious and I didn't know all this information about the ingredients. If we can convert that person to come in 3x a year, 4x a year, we think that's a big opportunity as well. So the vast majority of our attention goes on doing what we do but do it better than ever."

But companywide and overall, like I said in my opening comments  basically I think we were glad to hang on to the significant gains we made during 2014 when we had the very significant increases in throughput. But we didn't see an increase in overall throughput companywide during the quarter, which is always disappointing not to see that. But I think with, like Jack said, with even slightly negative comps, what happens, I think, with our teams is it's more difficult for them to break throughput records, and it becomes a little less top of mind for them as they start to focus on other aspects of the business waiting for that traffic to increase. So it certainly is a lot more fun to go out and set throughput records when they're shattering them on a daily basis and when there is a slight fall off in traffic even if it's just a flattening of traffic even for a short time. I think that sometimes, our eye is not on the ball to the degree it could be. So we do see improvements in a lot of our 4 pillars execution, which is great. We see some really good 15-minute transaction numbers and records in areas. But overall, I think that I would be eager to see our teams push harder on the throughput such as to deliver even incremental increases in the third quarter. So we'll keep working on that."

I'm pleased with our performance during the second quarter and first half of 2015. On the heels of what was arguably our best year ever as a public company in 2014, we have continued to post strong results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 14.1% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and the opening of 48 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.45 per share, an increase of 27.1%.  These results are particularly strong considering the very difficult comparisons we face and keep us on pace with the guidance we provided for 2015.
The strength of our business is the result of our focus on our unique food and people cultures. And in an increasingly crowded and competitive industry, these unique and compelling attributes continue to differentiate Chipotle and drive our success. During the quarter, we took a significant step to improve the food we serve when we completed our transition to using only non-GMO ingredients to make all the food we serve in our restaurants. We began this effort 2 years ago when we made the decision to voluntarily disclose the GMOs in our ingredients. Following that move, we worked to eliminate the limited number of GMO ingredients we were using to make our food, which included soybean oil and some ingredients in our tortillas. Today, all the food we serve at Chipotle restaurants is made with non-GMO ingredients.
While that decision was made with some criticism, most of which was tied to the notion that GM foods do not present any health risks to people who consume them, a majority of the response to our decision was overwhelmingly positive, and we believe it was the right thing to do for a number of reasons: First, we believe that a few GMO ingredients that were on our menu were not making our food any better in any way; second, that there was considerable debate about long-term impacts associated with GMO farming systems; and third, that more research is necessary to fully understand the impacts of GMO foods, particularly studies that are long term and independent in nature. Our position on GMOs very much aligns with consumer sentiment on this issue, and quite simply, Chipotle is the only national chain where consumers can eat anything on the menu without worry about eating GMOs.
This direction is not new for us, and the decision is very consistent with our overall culture of serving Food with Integrity. There are a number of ingredients that have been declared safe to eat, including artificial flavorings and colorings, for example, that are also not in our food. Simply because something is deemed safe doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it makes our food better in any way.
With our food now made entirely from non-GMO ingredients, we have set our sights on making better tortillas. These artisanal tortillas are made using only 5 ingredients: flour, water, starter, vegetable oil and salt. And when you consider that the starter, which is the leavening agent, is made from flour and water, it's really just 4 ingredients. While this might sound like a relatively simple undertaking, it's actually quite a challenge because one has to account for a number of variables: moisture in the flour, temperature and humidity in the bakery, strength of the starter, et cetera. And many of the chemical additives in commercial tortillas are designed to mitigate these variabilities. So while our tortillas necessitate the keen eye and hand of our bakers, we know that skilled bakers can make better-tasting tortillas more similar to homemade tortillas than we currently get at commercial scale.
Tortillas made commercially generally contain artificial additives, including preservatives, to extend their shelf life and dough conditioners to give them strength and the ability to stretch in order to eliminate the need for natural fermentation process of the dough. The new tortillas are working -- the new tortillas we are working to develop through a partnership with Washington State University's Bread Lab would have no artificial ingredients but rather will have only a few real whole ingredients that have traditionally been used to make tortillas.
Returning to this fresher, simpler tortilla essentially requires that we reinvent the way tortillas are made on a large scale, and that's exactly what we're doing. While we're in the very early stages of this project, the tortillas that we're making are delicious and perform very well. Later this fall, we'll be scaling the project up for continued testing. This is consistent with our overall Food with Integrity mission, one that respects the environment, farmers, the bakers, our customers' health and ultimately, their taste buds.
We have also made significant progress to resolve our pork shortage, which began in January. As you likely recall, we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers when a routine audit found that the supplier was not adhering to all facets of our animal welfare protocol. We have found a new supplier, Karro Food Group of the U.K. and have begun serving pork from Karro in most of our Florida restaurants, a little over 100 restaurants in total.
While it has always been our preference to source meats domestically, the quantity of pork that meets our standards is simply not available right now from domestic suppliers as the vast majority of pork raised in the United States, more than 95% based on our estimates, is not raised to our standards. The pork we are getting from Karro Foods meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards, including that this pork comes from pigs that are born on pasture and raised in deeply bedded barns. However, Karro adheres to a different antibiotic protocol. Under Karro's program, pigs can be given antibiotics under veterinary supervision and can remain in the supply. What is important to note is that antibiotics cannot be used subtherapeutically to promote growth at Karro. This program is common in the U.K. and has been endorsed by a number of animal welfare, scientific and veterinary organizations in the United States.  During the coming months, we'll be sourcing more pork from Karro and returning carnitas to the restaurants around the country on a market-by-market basis until we're fully supplied again, which we expect to happen before the end of the year.
We knew when we made the decision to suspend pork -- to suspend the pork supplier that it would leave us without enough pork for all of our restaurants and that our decision could impact customers' perceptions of Chipotle and have an impact on our sales. We are extremely pleased by the reaction from our customers, many of whom applauded us for taking this principled stand. As we continue to ramp up our pork supply, we expect to regain any lost sales tied to this outage.
We're making these changes to improve our ingredients as we continue on our Food with Integrity journey. For more than 15 years, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. In recent months, a number of food companies have made pledges to remove some artificial ingredients from their food, primarily things like artificial colors and preservatives. This reality, however, is that these ingredients make up only a portion of the thousands of additives used in processed foods. Aside from our tortillas, none of our foods include any of these additives. With competitors making vague pledges, we're strengthening our marketing message to continue to show the contrast between what Chipotle has always done and the changes others are pledging. We've always and will continue to make our food with the very best ingredients we can find, and once our tortilla project is complete, we will not rely on any of the artificial ingredients that are so prevalent in processed foods.
To highlight this differentiation, today we launched a new program called ""friends or faux"", spelled F-A-U-X, which is an integrated campaign that includes an interactive digital game that invites customers to learn about the difference between Chipotle's ingredients and those commonly used to make fast food and processed packaged foods. To play the game, consumers choose a Chipotle menu item and a representative traditional fast food item, and they compare and match the ingredients, identifying which items contain which ingredients. The online game will include a limited-time BOGO promotion for participants while encouraging customers to learn more about Food with Integrity mission. In addition to the game, the campaign is also supported by extensive online advertising, which begins today.
Constantly working to improve the quality and taste of the food we serve is embedded in our culture, and our track record to improve our food is unmatched in the industry. With the strength of our food culture and a unique and compelling people culture that further separates Chipotle from other restaurant companies, we believe we have the pieces in place to continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our very special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are providing a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience while also running our restaurants in the way that helps us maintain a strong unit economic model.
Having the best teams requires that we provide extraordinary opportunities for our people. The most unique benefit that we provide is the opportunity for our people to develop into the most effective leaders they can be with the most rewarding career possible, and this is at the core of our culture. But we also invest in benefits and compensation packages that match the talent in our teams.
During the quarter, a number of up-and-coming leaders took advantage of new opportunities as we promoted 39 managers into Restaurateur positions and also promoted 16 new field leaders, including 9 apprentice team leaders, 3 team leaders and 2 team directors. These promotions are what we've come to expect at Chipotle. Currently, more than 90% of our restaurant managers come from within the ranks of our crew, and we have promoted 5,900 people who started as crew into management positions just this year, on top of the 10,500 people who started as crew and were promoted into management positions last year. With our strong ability to develop our leaders from within and the importance of establishing Restaurateur cultures in all of our restaurants, our people culture continues to be a primary asset leading to our growth and also gives us great optimism that we will continue to experience strong growth going forward.
The leaders we are developing are able to attract other talented people to our company and are deeply committed to having these new people reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we are able to do things that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only do our teams run extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they also elevate the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an outstanding dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics.
To help perpetuate our culture and the development of our top performers, we held a meeting during the quarter with field leaders, some of them new to the company and others with long careers here, to discuss and clarify the role of all field leaders at Chipotle. We were pleased how committed our leaders are to the concept of achieving success by making others better. Our field leaders see more clearly now than ever that their success depends on the success of the people they lead. There's no ambiguity as to the priorities we have for our leaders at Chipotle. They know that their job is to develop Restaurateurs, and they have a very clear understanding as to how to do that.
We've told our field leaders that we define their success by looking at 3 things: first, that each general manager that they lead must know exactly why they're not a Restaurateur; Second, each of their general managers must be able to clearly state exactly what their plan is to become a Restaurateur and what their priorities are in order to do so; Third, the general managers must be actually developing into Restaurateurs. The most important tool field leaders have to help them succeed in this task is the Restaurateur diagnosis and plan tool. Using this tool allows our field leaders to uncover the positive and negative themes that may exist in each restaurant and to make a specific plan for how to best eliminate those negative themes. With the tool now well established, field leaders are using it as the basis for each visit to a restaurant, and with the proper progress updates, it is allowing our field leaders to chart the development path for Restaurateur cultures with each visit and each revision to the plan serving as a new chapter in the development story for the general manager. Of course, all of these stories should have the same ending: another team establishing a Restaurateur culture and adding to our group of elite leaders who are changing the way people think about and eat fast food.
During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our compensation and benefits programs, particularly at the crew level. We completed the first installment of our twice-annual merit increases for crew and made a onetime compensation adjustment for our kitchen managers and service managers to ensure compensation for those positions is consistent with the very high expectations that these rules carry.
We also made improvements to the benefits we offer hourly crew by increasing paid vacation and adding paid sick days and by expanding our tuition reimbursement program to include hourly employees in addition to the salary managers to whom this benefit was already available.
One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which generates great throughput. Our teams understand the qualities that make for great throughput are the same qualities that provide the very best customer service, having everything ready in the restaurant before customers arrive so that we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, as well as clear, authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed.
During the quarter, we held a national throughput competition to emphasize the importance of the 4 pillars in our restaurants. We achieved a number of new 1-hour throughput records by reiterating the fundamentals of throughput, and we continued to increase the number of restaurants that are implementing the 4 pillars during our peak dinner periods. As a result, we were able to largely maintain the substantial gains we made during 2014 to our throughput during our peak lunch and dinner hours. This is significant because last year was a tremendous year in which we delivered double-digit transaction comps that created a very tough comparison for this year. Our Restaurateurs continue to find opportunities to improve our standards and increase throughput, and we know that we're in a stronger position today as we're better prepared to utilize the 4 pillars to provide a more favorable customer experience.
Finally, on the development front, we are well on track throughout the first half of the year towards our guidance of opening 190 to 205 new restaurants. Actually, the pace of openings during the first half of the year gives us confidence that we'll finish 2015 at or above the high end of our guidance range for the full year. During the second quarter, we opened 48 new restaurants. That's a total of 97 so far for the year, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,878. After the end of the quarter, we also opened 1 new restaurant in London, where Chipotle continues to build a strong customer base. With at the first week of our -- of opening of our 7th restaurant in the U.K., our team has already beat the existing U.K. throughput record with 229 transactions during its peak lunch hour, which is very encouraging.
And finally, Canada's performance has been so successful, we no longer consider it to be a growth seed but rather a growth strategy. This means we now view Canada as a proven market, and we look to accelerate our pace of development in Canadian markets over the next year.
We also just completed the 2nd of our 3 Cultivate Festivals for the year as the most recent festival concluded in Kansas City last weekend. This year's event in Kansas City was a terrific success, and consumers were able to try out Pizzeria Locale at the festival ahead of our new restaurant opening tomorrow in Kansas City. We continue to further develop our growth seeds with a Pizzeria Locale opening in Cincinnati and a new ShopHouse to open in Chicago. So heading into the third quarter, we're in a great position from a development perspective, and we continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline.
We're excited about our results for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. With a strong food culture, a unique and empowering people culture and the best unit economics in the industry, we are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and we're delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."

We're proud of our performance through the first half of 2015 in which we continue to have positive comp sales on annual restaurant volumes that now average more than $2.5 million each. While our comparisons this year are the toughest we have faced as a public company, I'm confident that our top-performing teams will continue to attract more customers as they prepare and serve delicious food made from high-quality, sustainably raised ingredients.
I've been very active since our last earnings call visiting 5 of our 8 regions and spending time with our field leadership and restaurant teams and promoting 17 new Restaurateurs during that time, which gives me great confidence that we have a strong bench of up-and-coming future leaders to support our growth.
Our sales increased 14.1% in the quarter to $1.2 billion driven by new restaurant openings and a sales comp of 4.3%, which is right in line with the Q2 guidance of low and mid-single digits we provided in April. The comp was driven mainly by our price increase from last year, which contributed 4% to the comp. We've now fully lapped the price increase taken in the second quarter of 2014, so the 4% pricing benefit we enjoyed in Q2 is gone. Comp sales transaction counts in July so far remain a positive territory in the low single digits. 
We're still without pork in about 40% of our restaurants today, but July sales are benefiting slightly by about 60 basis points from a targeted price increase on steak and barbacoa. As we discussed during prior earnings calls, we decided to take this targeted menu price increase in steak and barbacoa as beef pricing remains at historically high levels, and our menu price gap between steak and barbacoa versus other entrées did not cover this higher cost. The average increase was just about 4% or about $0.30 per entrée.
We've not yet increased beef prices in about 40% of our restaurants, which have not been resupplied with carnitas. We held off in those markets as we want to avoid the unintended consequence of having customers trade from carnitas to steak or barbacoa and then be forced to pay more for their meal. Our intention is to raise beef prices in these markets once carnitas is back in supply. The price increase was effective earlier this month, and while it's still early, we've not seen any resistance so far.
For the full year, we continue to expect comps to be in the low to mid-single digits, including the targeted price increase on beef I just discussed. This assumes our comps remain in the low single digits for the rest of this year. As Steve mentioned, we recently added a new pork supplier, and we hope to be back in full supply of carnitas in all markets by early in Q4. In April, we estimated the pork shortage may have impacted our comp by as much as 200 basis points, and we believe the net impact for Q2 was in line with this estimate. And while we're optimistic that bringing pork back to all markets will help our comp, we have not included any bounce back related to carnitas in our guidance.
Restaurant-level margins increased 70 basis points to 28%, among our highest margins as a public company despite being a less-than-stellar quarter for our labor execution. Higher margins were driven by our lower food cost at 33.1%, which were 150 basis points better than last year and 80 basis points better than the first quarter. The lower food costs are tied to our menu price increase from last year along with lower pricing for dairy and avocados as lower dairy was driven by continued strong production and a strengthening U.S. dollar, and the avocado supply had benefited from an increased harvest of Mexican avocados.
Beef cost held relatively stable in the quarter but remained substantially elevated from historical levels and added nearly 100 basis points to our food cost compared to last year. We hope our food cost can remain at about this level through the back half of the year, but we do expect some pressure from avocados as we purchase more from the California growers and perhaps also from beef, which has been difficult to predict and could remain volatile.
Labor costs were 22.6% of sales during the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year. While labor rates are increasing at a faster rate than they have in a very long time, which I'll talk about a little later, the majority of this higher labor relates to ineffective labor scheduling and execution. We were hampered during the quarter by an interruption in our labor management reporting as result of implementing a new workforce enterprise system. Our investment in our operational systems are long-term investment that will allow for a more effective scheduling in the future but is not without some short-term hurdles that can be typical of these integration efforts. This has caused us to temporarily lose some oversight of our labor scheduling.
We've now reestablished most of the management reporting now. And so far, in July, we recaptured about half of the opportunity or about 40 basis points, and we expect to capture the rest of the opportunity during the third quarter. So the third quarter will still have somewhat elevated labor as we are recapturing the lost labor efficiency throughout this quarter, but we expect to be back to normal for all of Q4. We believe this labor challenge has negatively impacted EPS during the second quarter by about $0.16.
While we're disappointed with our labor execution, our field teams are committed to bring our labor back in line quickly. And they're going well beyond that to ensure that all of our restaurant managers and our field leaders become experts at writing and executing great schedules, so our labor deployment will be great with or without the availability of oversight reporting in the future. So I'm confident we will fully recapture this opportunity.
Hourly labor rates, including our hourly managers, increased 4.2% in the quarter, the fastest we have seen in many years. There has been a general increase in wage rates in many of our markets, and because we desire and expect to attract and reward only top performers, very important for us to stay ahead of the curve and pay attractive starting wages. We also continually monitor the pay of our top performers already in our restaurants as they progress through the manager rank to ensure we're paying fair wages in light of their significant contributions, and so this is also a contributing factor to the increase in the quarter.
As Monty mentioned, we also enhanced the benefits offered to our crew by adding up to a tuition reimbursement program and by paying for sick time and increasing the vacation pay. By far, the greatest benefit we offer to our people is the significant opportunity to advance in their leadership positions within Chipotle. But these enhancements represent important investments to ensure we're attracting, retaining and elevating the very best people into these leadership positions. We know that our special people culture with the Restaurateurs as the centerpiece leads to a better dining experience for our customers, better-tasting food, faster throughput, the development of extraordinary future leaders, better business results and ultimately, the creation of significant shareholder value. So it's important to note that improving our special people culture occurs through great leadership and having a Restaurateur vision and cannot simply be bought by throwing additional dollars at our team. But a key component of our people culture is to attract and retain great people, so we make these investments knowing it will make our company stronger. We expect the incremental cost of these investments to be about $2.5 million incrementally on a quarterly basis beginning in the third quarter.
We typically pay above-minimum wage in all of our markets, so a normal increase in local wages usually has little effect on us. But in some local markets, the minimum wage has been or soon will be pushed well above our national average rate. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the minimum wage was recently increased over $12 an hour. This increase, coupled with higher occupancy and other operating cost, excluding food cost, contribute to an overall cost of doing business up 30% or more compared to 30% or more higher than our average Chipotle. But our menu prices in the San Francisco area were, until recently, only about 4% above the typical Chipotle or lower than most competitors in the area. So as a result of looking at all of these factors, we decided we were underpriced in San Francisco, and we recently increased prices by 10% in the 10 restaurants within San Francisco and by 7% for the 74 restaurants outside San Francisco in the Bay Area. These relatively modest increases effectively pass along only some of the higher cost of doing business in that area. Because only 84 restaurants were affected, the impact on the overall company will be about 30 basis points on an annual basis.
We'll take a similar approach with the overall cost of doing business in a market are [ph] escalating on a case-by-case basis. Whether these higher costs are driven by legislative changes or by market forces. As an example, although the minimum wage in Maryland recently increased to over $10 an hour, our overall cost of doing business are reasonable there, and so we do not plan to increase our pricing in those restaurants. Our objective will always be to keep our menu accessible to our customers while being able to recruit the best people we can with competitive wages in each market and also while considering the overall cost of doing business and competitor prices in the area.
Occupancy costs for the quarter were 5.4% of sales, flat compared to last year. Other operating costs were 10.9% during the quarter, down 10 basis points from 2014. Marketing was 1.8% during the quarter, slightly lower than the second quarter of last year. And we continue to expect our marketing expense to be around 1.7% of sales overall for the year.
G&A was 5.9% in the quarter, down 120 basis points from the prior year due to lower noncash stock comp expense. Full year noncash stock comp is expected to be slightly below the $80 million we previously forecasted, and this expense will be more evenly weighted throughout the year.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.8%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014.
Last year benefited from an increase in the estimated usable state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credits, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.45, an increase of 27.1%. We finished the second quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term and long-term interest-bearing investments, and no debt on our balance sheet. Since our last earnings call on April 21 and through yesterday, we invested more than $100 million to repurchase nearly 164,000 shares of our stock at an average share price of $621. This was more than 4x the dollar amount invested during the first quarter and nearly 5x the number of shares purchased during Q1 when the average purchase price was $675. And this is a good example of what we mean by being optimistic when the timing -- with the timing and the magnitude of our share buybacks. While we continue to believe investing in our high-returning restaurants remains the best use of our cash, we'll also continue to invest opportunistically in repurchasing our stock. And today, we announced that our board has authorized investment of an additional $100 million to repurchase our stock, which brings our current unused authorization as of yesterday to $170 million.
Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions."

David, it's really early to know what the exact response is going to be based on this new supply that Steve talked about from Karro in the U.K. But when we saw other markets, you remember since January when we first ran out, we had this rolling blackout, so every several weeks, we would have one market run out of carnitas, and then we would replenish this volume in another market. And when you saw that, it took several weeks to get the full product mix back, and so -- and I would say that's anywhere between 3 weeks at the low side up to 5 or 6 weeks on the high side. So we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of that recovery as we continue to roll markets, but we're going to roll markets with this new supply of carnitas from now throughout the summer and then into early in the fourth quarter.

Yes, in fact, we've been investing in mobile on an ongoing basis for quite a while.

But we're also, on a continuing basis, updating our mobile ordering app to be more efficient. In fact, we did an update just a couple of months ago, and we have another one coming up, which make the ordering more accurate, which we're looking at having a significant impact. And one thing I'll direct you to that's not necessarily related to mobile but is also our efforts around catering, which currently cannot be ordered online nor can it be paid for online, that's another initiative that we're working on, which we expect will have an impact. With regard to loyalty, that's a tricky subject. We study this in depth, and we don't believe the general supposition that loyalty will make less frequent customers more frequent. We studied that and just simply don't believe that to be true. However, what you said is true in that you learn a tremendous amount of information about your customers. And so we're planning on doing that but not through a traditional loyalty program but rather through mobile payment. So we will provide our customers at sometime various options through which they can pay for their food, and we will capture data from them whether that's through a third-party or through our -- the ability to use our own gift cards, and that will give us a tremendous amount of data about those customers. So I can't tell you right now when those things are going to be complete, but we're investigating and pursuing all of them."

So food costs will either change or remain stable just based on commodity pricing, the pricing of the ingredients that we buy. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're hoping that those will remain stable and stay at about the level we just saw in the second quarter. So the rest of the P&L has some variable and some fixed costs in there. From a labor standpoint, we typically need a kind of a mid-single-digit comp in order to just hold our labor as a percentage of sales, so somewhere in that 4% to 6% range. So low single-digit comps would imply that we're going to delever on the labor line. The rest of the P&L, a low single-digit comp. It depends on whether it's a 1 or a 3. If it's in the 3 range, 2 or 3 range, unless there's something unusual with energy cost or something unusual, which would affect utilities, we should be okay. We should be able to about hold the rest of the cost on our P&L as a percentage of sales. So it really comes down to labor. Now keep in mind, we did announce all these benefits. And so regardless of the comp, we are going to see an incremental $2.5 million added to both the third quarter and fourth quarter, and that will continue as an additional cost of providing the benefits. And so that will cause some slight delevering as well."

When we roll the rest of the 40%, that will get us somewhere in the 100, 110 basis points or something like that. And then any other things that we do related to local cost of doing business, I would expect to be relatively modest. The example I gave you was San Francisco and the Bay Area. That adds an additional 30 basis points. There's not much else going on really between now and the end of the year, so I would say we're going to be between the -- if you take the 60 on the higher cost of steak and barbacoa, add 30 from San Francisco, that's 90. There might be another 30, 40 basis points or so that will roll in over the next several months, and that would be about it for this year. There are some additional structural costs, higher cost of doing business that we will look at next year like we did in San Francisco. But just because minimum wage is increasing in a market, doesn't mean we're going to raise prices. The example that I gave in Maryland is a great example. Another one is in Chicago. Chicago just recently implemented a higher minimum wage, and we don't expect to raise prices there in the near future, probably not at all this year. And so we'll look at it market by market, and there might be some cases where when you look at all of our cost of doing business, that we might deem that it's necessary to take a price increase in those markets.

Karen, we have done a very thorough analysis of kind of the traditional loyalty programs. And the problem is Chipotle already has so many loyal customers that the fixed cost of implementing an ongoing loyalty program were so extraordinary that you had to get a pretty big incremental comp just to cover those costs, and then you had to get a comp on top of that and then maintain it for it to be profitable at all. What we found is we've been able to build loyalty through more organic methods by encouraging people to learn more about Chipotle, by piquing their interest about how food is raised, by having them come in to Chipotle and be treated to an extraordinary dining experience. And so we've seen our loyalty go up over the years, and we think that's the better way to do it than putting in a structural framework that we didn't think was going to be profitable at all and -- or maybe would be a breakeven or you'd have to do an [ph] extraordinary comp to make it pay up.

But on the data side, you're absolutely right. That's what we want, and we believe that we can achieve perhaps not the same level of granularity in the information but enough information through a payment system that'll give us what we want essentially without the downsides of the certainly ongoing weight of the loyalty program.

And the pricing structure happens to be a little bit higher, especially the ones that our customers are choosing. They're choosing the build your own more frequently, and that's a little bit more expensive. So those are the pieces, but they're all very, very small numbers."

If I recall correctly the history of Chipotle, you got a real first-mover advantage in many markets by entering before your key competitors. And when you did so, you did better. And when you were second, you did less well, maybe eventually did better but maybe initially not as well. When you look at the newer concepts, in particularly pizza, you're now badly lagging behind several chains that are in that category. Why isn't that incentive be more urgency to develop faster? Is there other concerns you have about the concept and you're not ready to do that? Do you think it's going to be different for pizza than it was perhaps for your core concept? Or is this first-mover advantage maybe an overblown advantage?"

When we were partnered with McDonald's, they were telling us how important it was in their development. Although if you look at our history and our sales trends when we come into markets and we're not the first mover, we definitely pass them. I mean, California is the best example where we had 2 big competitors, and we severely lagged behind them. Over time, though, through great execution and through a great people culture and sharing with our customers what makes Chipotle food special, we quickly took the lead. I think the best -- the most important thing we can do is to have concepts that really resonate with customers. And we spend -- have spent a lot of time refining the Pizzeria Locale concept. We've gone through a couple of iterations of dough, and we think we have perfected it now. It's really excellent, and that's been in the restaurants now for a couple of months. And we feel confident that as we start with this dough in 2 new markets, in Kansas City and in Cincinnati, Kansas City just in a couple of days on Wednesday, actually tomorrow and then Cincinnati in the fall, that we're going to prove to customers that our pizza, our dough, our method of this new way to serve pizza is superior to the competition out there. How long it takes to lap their sales volumes? I don't know. But if history is any indication, sticking to the things that really matter like putting teams of top performers who are really empowered to achieve extraordinary things and giving them leadership opportunity sets the foundation so they can deliver an excellent dining experience, and that's exactly what we're doing."

And so we think it's a better way to do it. We will get more aggressive as the price does drop. We do have more cash than we need. We know that the best way to add to shareholder value is to ready these growth seeds, they be promoted to growth strategy just like Canada was. We know that as we open up more Chipotles, we're opening the Chipotles at extraordinary returns and the cash-on-cash returns in the 70%, 80% range.

So I would say right now we're not necessarily seeing an acceleration other than in respect to the worst weather in the first quarter. We still think we're being hampered by not having carnitas, and we think that could be as much as a couple of hundred basis points. And so we look at it as more the years unfolding the way we thought it was. We thought that we would do 4% in the quarter. Our guidance was exactly that. We were predicting internally about 4% during the second quarter, and that's what it's doing. We'd also predicted that in the third quarter, while it's early, that we would be in the low single digits, that it wouldn't be negative, that it would be close.

Just the throughput, the business control is everything when we have great leaders, Restaurateur leaders that have all top performers, where there's a culture of empowerment. And these teams can deliver high standards in every single way. And so that's still and always will be the vast majority of where our attention goes. We are testing chorizo in a market right now in Kansas City. We'll -- it's early. We've only had it in market for several weeks right now. We -- just this week, Mark, I think, started advertising. If that's something that looks like it's either attracting new customers or it's encouraging existing customers to visit more often, that might move up in the priority list. If all chorizo does is take our existing customers and split them among additional menu items, that will be less appealing to us because that just means we have more menu items serving the same customers, and that makes it more complicated and more difficult to serve all this delicious food. So I come back to, in terms of priority, the difference between a great running Restaurateur restaurant with an amazing team compared to one that has a lot of themes that Monty talked about, the BBT [ph] , a restaurant that has a lot of themes and they have some low performers on the team, and empowerment is not great. The difference in the quality and taste of the food, the difference in how clean that restaurant is, just the difference in when you walk in you feel like you're welcomed by a team of people that know you and are glad you're there, the difference when you compare that experience to a restaurant that doesn't have all top performers and doesn't have the culture of empowerment is dramatic. And we believe that, that's the single biggest thing we can do to build our sales over time. The other thing with marketing is we still believe that -- or we still know that there's lots of people that have never been to Chipotle. Something like 35% or 40% of people have never been to Chipotle. We know that when we study our existing customers that there's like 55% of our customers only come a couple of times a year. And so they're -- the more we can educate and entertain and things like this BOGO where if we can entice customers that don't come very often, once or twice a year, to learn more about our ingredients versus competitors, traditional fast food and get a BOGO to entice them to come in and that causes them to say, ""Oh my God, I mean, I haven't been in 6 months. This food is delicious, and I didn't know all this information about the ingredients."" If we can convert that person into coming in 3 times a year or 4 times a year, we think that's a big opportunity as well. So the vast majority of our attention goes on doing what we do but do it better than ever."

But company wide and overall, like I said in my opening comments, we were -- basically, we were -- I think we were glad to hang on to the significant gains we made during 2014 when we had the very significant increases in throughput. But we didn't see an increase in overall throughput company wide during the quarter, which it's always disappointing not to see that. But I think with -- like Jack said, with even slightly negative comps, what happens, I think, with our teams is it's more difficult for them to break throughput records, and it becomes a little less top of mind for them, as they start to focus on other aspects of the business, waiting for that traffic to increase. So it certainly is a lot more fun to go out and set throughput records when they're shattering them on a daily basis. And when there is a slight falloff in traffic even if it's just a flattening of traffic even for a short time, I think that sometimes, our eye is not on the ball to a degree it could be. So we do see improvements in a lot of our 4 pillars execution, which is great. We see some really good 15-minute transaction numbers and records in areas. But overall, I think that I would be eager to see our teams push harder on the throughput such as to deliver even incremental increases in the third quarter. So we'll keep working on that."

I'm pleased with our performance during the second quarter and first half of 2015. On the heels of what was arguably our best year ever as a public company in 2014, we have continued to post strong results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 14.1% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and the opening of 48 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.45 per share, an increase of 27.1%.  These results are particularly strong considering the very difficult comparisons we face and keep us on pace with the guidance we provided for 2015.
The strength of our business is the result of our focus on our unique food and people cultures. And in an increasingly crowded and competitive industry, these unique and compelling attributes continue to differentiate Chipotle and drive our success. During the quarter, we took a significant step to improve the food we serve when we completed our transition to using only non-GMO ingredients to make all the food we serve in our restaurants. We began this effort 2 years ago when we made the decision to voluntarily disclose the GMOs in our ingredients. Following that move, we worked to eliminate the limited number of GMO ingredients we were using to make our food, which included soybean oil and some ingredients in our tortillas. Today, all the food we serve at Chipotle restaurants is made with non-GMO ingredients.
While that decision was made with some criticism, most of which was tied to the notion that GM foods do not present any health risks to people who consume them, a majority of the response to our decision was overwhelmingly positive, and we believe it was the right thing to do for a number of reasons: First, we believe that a few GMO ingredients that were on our menu were not making our food any better in any way; second, that there was considerable debate about long-term impacts associated with GMO farming systems; and third, that more research is necessary to fully understand the impacts of GMO foods, particularly studies that are long term and independent in nature. Our position on GMOs very much aligns with consumer sentiment on this issue, and quite simply, Chipotle is the only national chain where consumers can eat anything on the menu without worry about eating GMOs.
This direction is not new for us, and the decision is very consistent with our overall culture of serving Food with Integrity. There are a number of ingredients that have been declared safe to eat, including artificial flavorings and colorings, for example, that are also not in our food. Simply because something is deemed safe doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it makes our food better in any way.
With our food now made entirely from non-GMO ingredients, we have set our sights on making better tortillas. These artisanal tortillas are made using only 5 ingredients: flour, water, starter, vegetable oil and salt. And when you consider that the starter, which is the leavening agent, is made from flour and water, it's really just 4 ingredients. While this might sound like a relatively simple undertaking, it's actually quite a challenge because one has to account for a number of variables: moisture in the flour, temperature and humidity in the bakery, strength of the starter, et cetera. And many of the chemical additives in commercial tortillas are designed to mitigate these variabilities. So while our tortillas necessitate the keen eye and hand of our bakers, we know that skilled bakers can make better-tasting tortillas more similar to homemade tortillas than we currently get at commercial scale.
Tortillas made commercially generally contain artificial additives, including preservatives to extend their shelf life and dough conditioners to give them strength and the ability to stretch in order to eliminate the need for natural fermentation process of the dough. The new tortillas are working -- the new tortillas we are working to develop through a partnership with Washington State University's Bread Lab would have no artificial ingredients but rather will have only a few real whole ingredients that have traditionally been used to make tortillas.
Returning to this fresher, simpler tortilla essentially requires that we reinvent the way tortillas are made on a large scale, and that's exactly what we're doing. While we're in the very early stages of this project, the tortillas that we're making are delicious and perform very well. Later this fall, we'll be scaling the project up for continued testing. This is consistent with our overall Food with Integrity mission, one that respects the environment, farmers, the bakers, our customers' health and ultimately, their taste buds.
We have also made significant progress to resolve our pork shortage, which began in January. As you likely recall, we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers when a routine audit found that the supplier was not adhering to all facets of our animal welfare protocol. We have found a new supplier, Karro Food Group of the U.K. and have begun serving pork from Karro in most of our Florida restaurants, a little over 100 restaurants in total.
While it has always been our preference to source meats domestically, the quantity of pork that meets our standards is simply not available right now from domestic suppliers as the vast majority of pork raised in the United States, more than 95% based on our estimates, is not raised to our standards. The pork we are getting from Karro Foods meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards, including that this pork comes from pigs that are born on pasture and raised in deeply bedded barns. However, Karro adheres to a different antibiotic protocol. Under Karro's program, pigs can be given antibiotics under veterinary supervision and can remain in the supply. What is important to note is that antibiotics cannot be used subtherapeutically to promote growth at Karro. This program is common in the U.K. and has been endorsed by a number of animal welfare, scientific and veterinary organizations in the United States.  During the coming months, we'll be sourcing more pork from Karro and returning carnitas to the restaurants around the country on a market-by-market basis until we're fully supplied again, which we expect to happen before the end of the year.
We knew when we made the decision to suspend pork -- to suspend the pork supplier that it would leave us without enough pork for all of our restaurants and that our decision could impact customers' perceptions of Chipotle and have an impact on our sales. We are extremely pleased by the reaction from our customers, many of whom applauded us for taking this principled stand. As we continue to ramp up our pork supply, we expect to regain any lost sales tied to this outage.
We're making these changes to improve our ingredients as we continue on our Food with Integrity journey. For more than 15 years, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. In recent months, a number of food companies have made pledges to remove some artificial ingredients from their food, primarily things like artificial colors and preservatives. This reality, however, is that these ingredients make up only a portion of the thousands of additives used in processed foods. Aside from our tortillas, none of our foods include any of these additives. With competitors making vague pledges, we're strengthening our marketing message to continue to show the contrast between what Chipotle has always done and the changes others are pledging. We've always and will continue to make our food with the very best ingredients we can find, and once our tortilla project is complete, we will not rely on any of the artificial ingredients that are so prevalent in processed foods.
To highlight this differentiation, today we launched a new program called ""friends or faux"", spelled F-A-U-X, which is an integrated campaign that includes an interactive digital game that invites customers to learn about the difference between Chipotle's ingredients and those commonly used to make fast food and processed packaged foods. To play the game, consumers choose a Chipotle menu item and a representative traditional fast food item, and they compare and match the ingredients, identifying which items contain which ingredients. The online game will include a limited-time BOGO promotion for participants while encouraging customers to learn more about Food with Integrity mission. In addition to the game, the campaign is also supported by extensive online advertising, which begins today.
Constantly working to improve the quality and taste of the food we serve is embedded in our culture, and our track record to improve our food is unmatched in the industry. With the strength of our food culture and a unique and compelling people culture that further separates Chipotle from other restaurant companies, we believe we have the pieces in place to continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our very special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are providing a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience while also running our restaurants in a way that helps us maintain a strong unit economic model.
Having the best teams requires that we provide extraordinary opportunities for our people. The most unique benefit that we provide is the opportunity for our people to develop into the most effective leaders they can be with the most rewarding career possible, and this is at the core of our culture. But we also invest in benefits and compensation packages that match the talent in our teams.
During the quarter, a number of up-and-coming leaders took advantage of new opportunities as we promoted 39 managers into Restaurateur positions and also promoted 16 new field leaders, including 9 apprentice team leaders, 3 team leaders and 2 team directors. These promotions are what we've come to expect at Chipotle. Currently, more than 90% of our restaurant managers come from within the ranks of our crew, and we have promoted 5,900 people who started as crew into management positions just this year, on top of the 10,500 people who started as crew and were promoted into management positions last year. With our strong ability to develop our leaders from within and the importance of establishing Restaurateur cultures in all of our restaurants, our people culture continues to be a primary asset leading to our growth and also gives us great optimism that we will continue to experience strong growth going forward.
The leaders we are developing are able to attract other talented people to our company and are deeply committed to having these new people reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we are able to do things that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only do our teams run extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they also elevate the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an outstanding dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics.
To help perpetuate our culture and the development of our top performers, we held a meeting during the quarter with field leaders, some of them new to the company and others with long careers here, to discuss and clarify the role of all field leaders at Chipotle. We were pleased how committed our leaders are to the concept of achieving success by making others better. Our field leaders see more clearly now than ever that their success depends on the success of the people they lead. There's no ambiguity as to the priorities we have for our leaders at Chipotle. They know that their job is to develop Restaurateurs, and they have a very clear understanding as to how to do that.
We've told our field leaders that we define their success by looking at 3 things: First, that each general manager that they lead must know exactly why they're not a Restaurateur; second, each of their general managers must be able to clearly state exactly what their plan is to become a Restaurateur and what their priorities are in order to do so; third, the general managers must be actually developing into Restaurateurs. 
The most important tool field leaders have to help them succeed in this task is the Restaurateur diagnosis and plan tool. Using this tool allows our field leaders to uncover the positive and negative themes that may exist in each restaurant and to make a specific plan for how to best eliminate those negative themes. With the tool now well established, field leaders are using it as the basis for each visit to a restaurant, and, with the proper progress updates, it is allowing our field leaders to chart the development path for Restaurateur cultures with each visit and each revision to the plan serving as a new chapter in the development story for the general manager. Of course, all of these stories should have the same ending: another team establishing a Restaurateur culture and adding to our group of elite leaders who are changing the way people think about and eat fast food.
During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our compensation and benefits programs, particularly at the crew level. We completed the first installment of our twice-annual merit increases for crew and made a onetime compensation adjustment for our kitchen managers and service managers to ensure compensation for those positions is consistent with the very high expectations that these rules carry.
We also made improvements to the benefits we offer hourly crew by increasing paid vacation and adding paid sick days and by expanding our tuition reimbursement program to include hourly employees in addition to the salary managers to whom this benefit was already available.
One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which generates great throughput. Our teams understand the qualities that make for great throughput are the same qualities that provide the very best customer service, having everything ready in the restaurant before customers arrive so that we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, as well as clear, authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed.
During the quarter, we held a national throughput competition to emphasize the importance of the 4 pillars in our restaurants. We achieved a number of new 1-hour throughput records by reiterating the fundamentals of throughput, and we continued to increase the number of restaurants that are implementing the 4 pillars during our peak dinner periods. As a result, we were able to largely maintain the substantial gains we made during 2014 to our throughput during our peak lunch and dinner hours. This is significant because last year was a tremendous year in which we delivered double-digit transaction comps that created the very tough comparison for this year. Our Restaurateurs continue to find opportunities to improve our standards and increase throughput, and we know that we're in a stronger position today as we're better prepared to utilize the 4 pillars to provide a more favorable customer experience.
Finally, on the development front, we are well on track throughout the first half of the year towards our guidance of opening 190 to 205 new restaurants. Actually, the pace of openings during the first half of the year gives us confidence that we'll finish 2015 at or above the high end of our guidance range for the full year. During the second quarter, we opened 48 new restaurants. That's a total of 97 so far for the year, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,878. After the end of the quarter, we also opened 1 new restaurant in London, where Chipotle continues to build a strong customer base. With the first week of our -- of opening of our 7th restaurant in the U.K., our team has already beat the existing U.K. throughput record with 229 transactions during its peak lunch hour, which is very encouraging.
And finally, Canada's performance has been so successful that we no longer consider it to be a growth seed but rather, a growth strategy. This means we now view Canada as a proven market, and we'll look to accelerate our pace of development in Canadian markets over the next year.
We also just completed the second of our 3 Cultivate Festivals for the year as the most recent festival concluded in Kansas City last weekend. This year's event in Kansas City was a terrific success, and consumers were able to try out Pizzeria Locale at the festival ahead of our new restaurant opening tomorrow in Kansas City. We continue to further develop our growth seeds with a Pizzeria Locale opening in Cincinnati and a new ShopHouse to open in Chicago. So heading into the third quarter, we're in a great position from a development perspective, and we continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline.
We're excited about our results for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. With a strong food culture, a unique and empowering people culture and the best unit economics in the industry, we are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and we're delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."

We're proud of our performance through the first half of 2015 in which we continue to have positive comp sales on annual restaurant volumes that now average more than $2.5 million each. While our comparisons this year are the toughest we have faced as a public company, I'm confident that our top-performing teams will continue to attract more customers as they prepare and serve delicious food made from high-quality, sustainably raised ingredients.
I've been very active since our last earnings call visiting 5 of our 8 regions and spending time with our field leadership and restaurant teams and promoting 17 new Restaurateurs during that time, which gives me great confidence that we have a strong bench of up-and-coming future leaders to support our growth.
Our sales increased 14.1% in the quarter to $1.2 billion driven by new restaurant openings and a sales comp of 4.3%, which is right in line with the Q2 guidance of low to mid-single digits we provided in April. The comp was driven mainly by our price increase from last year, which contributed 4% to the comp. We've now fully lapped the price increase taken in the second quarter of 2014, so the 4% pricing benefit we enjoyed in Q2 is gone. Comp sales transaction counts in July so far remain in positive territory in the low single digits. 
We're still without pork in about 40% of our restaurants today, but July sales are benefiting slightly by about 60 basis points from a targeted price increase on steak and barbacoa. As we discussed during prior earnings calls, we decided to take this targeted menu price increase in steak and barbacoa as beef pricing remains at historically high levels, and our menu price gap between steak and barbacoa versus other entrées did not cover this higher cost. The average increase was just about 4% or about $0.30 per entrée.
We've not yet increased beef prices in about 40% of our restaurants, which have not been resupplied with carnitas. We held off in those markets as we want to avoid the unintended consequence of having customers trade from carnitas to steak or barbacoa and then be forced to pay more for their meal. Our intention is to raise beef prices in these markets once carnitas is back in supply. The price increase was effective earlier this month, and while it's still early, we've not seen any resistance so far.
For the full year, we continue to expect comps to be in the low to mid-single digits, including the targeted price increase on beef I just discussed. This assumes our comps remain in the low single digits for the rest of this year. As Steve mentioned, we recently added a new pork supplier, and we hope to be back in full supply of carnitas in all markets by early in Q4. In April, we estimated the pork shortage may have impacted our comp by as much as 200 basis points, and we believe the net impact for Q2 was in line with this estimate. And while we're optimistic that bringing pork back to all markets will help our comp, we have not included any bounce back related to carnitas in our guidance.
Restaurant-level margins increased 70 basis points to 28%, among our highest margins as a public company despite being a less-than-stellar quarter for our labor execution. Higher margins were driven by our lower food cost at 33.1%, which were 150 basis points better than last year and 80 basis points better than the first quarter. The lower food costs are tied to our menu price increase from last year along with lower pricing for dairy and avocados as lower dairy was driven by continued strong production and a strengthening U.S. dollar, and the avocado supply had benefited from an increased harvest of Mexican avocados.
Beef cost held relatively stable in the quarter but remained substantially elevated from historical levels and added nearly 100 basis points to our food cost compared to last year. We hope our food cost can remain at about this level through the back half of the year, but we do expect some pressure from avocados as we purchase more from the California growers and perhaps also from beef, which has been difficult to predict and could remain volatile.
Labor costs were 22.6% of sales during the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year. While labor rates are increasing at a faster rate than they have in a very long time, which I'll talk about a little later, the majority of this higher labor relates to ineffective labor scheduling and execution. We were hampered during the quarter by an interruption in our labor management reporting as result of implementing a new workforce enterprise system. Our investment in our operational systems are a long-term investment that will allow for a more effective scheduling in the future but is not without some short-term hurdles that can be typical of these integration efforts. This has caused us to temporarily lose some oversight of our labor scheduling.
We've now reestablished most of the management reporting now. And so far, in July, we recaptured about half of the opportunity or about 40 basis points, and we expect to capture the rest of the opportunity during the third quarter. So the third quarter will still have somewhat elevated labor as we are recapturing the lost labor efficiency throughout this quarter, but we expect to be back to normal for all of Q4. We believe this labor challenge has negatively impacted EPS during the second quarter by about $0.16.
While we're disappointed with our labor execution, our field teams are committed to bring our labor back in line quickly. And they're going well beyond that to ensure that all of our restaurant managers and our field leaders become experts at writing and executing great schedules, so our labor deployment will be great with or without the availability of oversight reporting in the future. So I'm confident we will fully recapture this opportunity.
Hourly labor rates, including our hourly managers, increased 4.2% in the quarter, the fastest we have seen in many years. There has been a general increase in wage rates in many of our markets, and because we desire and expect to attract and reward only top performers, very important for us to stay ahead of the curve and pay attractive starting wages. We also continually monitor the pay of our top performers already in our restaurants as they progress through the manager rank to ensure we're paying fair wages in light of their significant contributions, and so this is also a contributing factor to the increase in the quarter.
As Monty mentioned, we also enhanced the benefits offered to our crew by adding a tuition reimbursement program and by paying for sick time and increasing the vacation pay. By far, the greatest benefit we offer to our people is the significant opportunity to advance in their leadership positions within Chipotle. But these enhancements represent important investments to ensure we're attracting, retaining and elevating the very best people into these leadership positions. We know that our special people culture with the Restaurateurs as the centerpiece leads to a better dining experience for our customers, better-tasting food, faster throughput, the development of extraordinary future leaders, better business results and ultimately, the creation of significant shareholder value. So it's important to note that improving our special people culture occurs through great leadership and having a Restaurateur vision and cannot simply be bought by throwing additional dollars at our team. But a key component of our people culture is to attract and retain great people, so we make these investments knowing it will make our company stronger. We expect the incremental cost of these investments to be about $2.5 million incrementally on a quarterly basis beginning in the third quarter.
We typically pay above-minimum wage in all of our markets, so a normal increase in local wages usually has little effect on us. But in some local markets, the minimum wage has been or soon will be pushed well above our national average rate. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the minimum wage was recently increased to over $12 an hour. This increase, coupled with higher occupancy and other operating cost, excluding food cost, contribute to an overall cost of doing business of 30% or more compared to 30% or more higher than our average Chipotle. But our menu prices in the San Francisco area were, until recently, only about 4% above the typical Chipotle and we're lower than most competitors in the area. So as a result of looking at all of these factors, we decided we were underpriced in San Francisco, and we recently increased prices by 10% in the 10 restaurants within San Francisco and by 7% for the 74 restaurants outside San Francisco in the Bay Area. These relatively modest increases effectively pass along only some of the higher costs of doing business in that area. Because only 84 restaurants were affected, the impact on the overall company will be about 30 basis points on an annual basis.
We'll take a similar approach when the overall costs of doing business in our market are escalating on a case-by-case basis, whether these higher costs are driven by legislative changes or by market forces. As an example, although the minimum wage in Maryland recently increased to over $10 an hour, our overall costs of doing business are reasonable there, and so we do not plan to increase our pricing in those restaurants. Our objective will always be to keep our menu accessible to our customers while being able to recruit the best people we can with competitive wages in each market and also while considering the overall costs of doing business and competitor prices in the area.
Occupancy costs for the quarter were 5.4% of sales, flat compared to last year. Other operating costs were 10.9% during the quarter, down 10 basis points from 2014. Marketing was 1.8% during the quarter, slightly lower than the second quarter of last year. And we continue to expect our marketing expense to be around 1.7% of sales overall for the year.
G&A was 5.9% in the quarter, down 120 basis points from the prior year due to lower noncash stock comp expense. Full year noncash stock comp is expected to be slightly below the $80 million we previously forecasted, and this expense will be more evenly weighted throughout the year.
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.8%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014.
Last year benefited from an increase in the estimated usable state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credits, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.45, an increase of 27.1%. We finished the second quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term and long-term interest-bearing investments, and no debt on our balance sheet. Since our last earnings call on April 21 and through yesterday, we invested more than $100 million to repurchase nearly 164,000 shares of our stock at an average share price of $621. This was more than 4x the dollar amount invested during the first quarter and nearly 5x the number of shares purchased during Q1 when the average purchase price was $675. And this is a good example of what we mean by being optimistic when the timing -- with the timing and the magnitude of our share buybacks. While we continue to believe investing in our high-returning restaurants remains the best use of our cash, we'll also continue to invest opportunistically in repurchasing our stock. And today, we announced that our board has authorized the investment of an additional $100 million to repurchase our stock, which brings our current unused authorization as of yesterday to $170 million.
Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions."

David, it's really early to know what the exact response is going to be based on this new supply that Steve talked about from Karro in the U.K. But when we saw other markets, you remember since January when we first ran out, we had this rolling blackout, so every several weeks, we would have one market run out of carnitas, and then we would replenish this volume in another market. And when you saw that, it took several weeks to get full product mix back, and so -- and I would say that's anywhere between 3 weeks, at the low side, up to 5 or 6 weeks on the high side. So we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of that recovery as we continue to roll markets, but we're going to roll markets with this new supply of carnitas from now throughout the summer and then into early in the fourth quarter. And so hopefully, what we'll see market by market is that the product mix will recover over several weeks and that we'll start to see sales comps recover as well."

In fact, we did an update just a couple of months ago, and we have another one coming up, which make the ordering more accurate, which we're looking at having a significant impact. And one thing I'll direct you to that's not necessarily related to mobile but is also our efforts around catering, which currently cannot be ordered online nor can it be paid for online, that's another initiative that we're working on, which we expect will have an impact. With regard to loyalty, that's a tricky subject. We studied this in depth, and we don't believe the general supposition of loyalty will make less frequent customers more frequent. We studied that and just simply don't believe that to be true. However, what you said is true in that you learn a tremendous amount of information about your customers. And so we're planning on doing that but not through a traditional loyalty program but rather through mobile payment. So we will provide our customers at some time various options through which they can pay for their food, and we will capture data from them, whether that's through a third-party or through our -- the ability to use our own gift cards, and that will give us a tremendous amount of data about those customers.

So food costs will either change or remain stable just based on commodity pricing, the pricing of the ingredients that we buy. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're hoping that those will remain stable and stay at about the level we just saw in the second quarter. So the rest of the P&L has some variable and some fixed costs in there. From a labor standpoint, we typically need a -- kind of a mid-single-digit comp in order to just hold our labor as a percentage of sales, so somewhere in that 4% to 6% range. So low single-digit comps would imply that we're going to delever on the labor line. The rest of the P&L, a low single-digit comp, it depends on whether it's a 1 or a 3. If it's in the 3 range, 2 or 3 range, unless there's something unusual with energy costs or something unusual which would affect utilities, we should be okay. We should be able to about hold the rest of the costs on our P&L as a percentage of sales. So it really comes down to labor. Now keep in mind, we did announce all these benefits. And so regardless of the comp, we are going to see an incremental $2.5 million added to both the third quarter and fourth quarter, and that will continue as an additional cost of providing the benefits. And so that will cause some slight delevering as well."

And our beef, our steak and barbacoa is somewhere in the 30% range in terms of product mix. So we're right now running about 60 basis points of incremental comp because of raising prices on beef. When we roll the rest of the 40%, that will get us somewhere in the 100, 110 basis points or something like that. And then any other things that we do related to local cost of doing business, I would expect to be relatively modest. The example I gave you was San Francisco and the Bay Area. That adds an additional 30 basis points. There's not much else going on really between now and the end of the year, so I would say we're going to be between the -- if you take the 60 on the higher costs of steak and barbacoa, add 30 from San Francisco, that's 90. There might be another 30, 40 basis points or so that will roll in over the next several months, and that would be about it for this year. There are some additional structural costs, higher costs of doing business that we will look at next year like we did in San Francisco. But just because minimum wage is increasing in a market, doesn't mean we're going to raise prices. The example that I gave in Maryland is a great example. Another one is in Chicago. Chicago just recently implemented a higher minimum wage, and we don't expect to raise prices there in the near future, probably not at all this year. And so we'll look at it market by market, and there might be some cases where when you look at all of our costs of doing business, that we might deem that it's necessary to take a price increase in those markets. But I wouldn't expect that to be a significant add-on to our comp or a significant add-on to the menu price increase."

Karen, we have done a very thorough analysis of kind of the traditional loyalty programs. And the problem is Chipotle already has so many loyal customers that the fixed costs of implementing an ongoing loyalty program were so extraordinary that you had to get a pretty big incremental comp just to cover those costs, and then you had to get a comp on top of that and then maintain it for it to be profitable at all. What we found is we've been able to build loyalty through more organic methods by encouraging people to learn more about Chipotle, by piquing their interest about how food is raised, by having them come in to Chipotle and be treated to an extraordinary dining experience. And so we've seen our loyalty go up over the years, and we think that's the better way to do it than putting in a structural framework that we didn't think was going to be profitable at all and -- or maybe it would be a breakeven or you'd have to do extraordinary comp to make it pay off.

We have ongoing ways to give our most valuable customers ways to interact with Chipotle, where they learn a little bit more, and we give them some free food in exchange. But on the data side, you're absolutely right. That's what we want, and we believe that we can achieve perhaps not the same level of granularity in the information but enough information through a payment system that'll give us what we want essentially without the downsides of the certainly ongoing weight of a loyalty program.

Over time, though, through great execution and through a great people culture and sharing with our customers what makes Chipotle food special, we quickly took the lead. I think the best -- the most important thing we can do is to have concepts that really resonate with customers. And we spend -- have spent a lot of time refining the Pizzeria Locale concept. We've gone through a couple of iterations of dough, and we think we have perfected it now. It's really excellent, and that's been in the restaurants now for a couple of months. And we feel confident that as we start with this dough in 2 new markets, in Kansas City and in Cincinnati, Kansas City just in a couple of days on Wednesday, actually tomorrow and then Cincinnati in the fall, that we're going to prove to customers that our pizza, our dough, our method of this new way to serve pizza is superior to the competition out there. How long it takes to lap their sales volumes, I don't know.

Just the throughput, the business control is everything when we have great leaders, Restaurateur leaders that have all top performers, where there's a culture of empowerment. And these teams can deliver high standards in every single way. And so that's still and always will be the vast majority of where our attention goes. We are testing chorizo in a market right now in Kansas City. It will -- it's early. We've only had it in market for several weeks right now. We, just this week, Mark, I think, started advertising. If that's something that looks like it's either attracting new customers or it's encouraging existing customers to visit more often, that might move up in the priority list. If all chorizo does is take our existing customers and split them among additional menu items, that will be less appealing to us because that just means we have more menu items serving the same customers, and that makes it more complicated and more difficult to serve all this delicious food. So I come back to, in terms of priority, the difference between a great running Restaurateur restaurant with an amazing team compared to one that has a lot of themes that Monty talked about, the BBT [ph], a restaurant that has a lot of themes and they have some low performers on the team, and empowerment is not great. The difference in the quality and taste of the food, the difference in how clean that restaurant is, just the difference in when you walk in you feel like you're welcomed by a team of people that know you and are glad you're there, the difference when you compare that experience to a restaurant that doesn't have all top performers and doesn't have the culture of empowerment is dramatic. And we believe that that's the single biggest thing we can do to build our sales over time. The other thing with marketing is we still believe that -- or we still know that there's lots of people that have never been to Chipotle. Something like 35% or 40% of people have never been to Chipotle. We know that when we study our existing customers that there's like 55% of our customers only come a couple of times a year. And so they're -- the more we can educate and entertain and things like this BOGO where, if we can entice customers that don't come very often, once or twice a year, to learn more about our ingredients versus competitors, traditional fast food and get a BOGO to entice them to come in and that causes them to say, ""Oh my God, I mean, I haven't been in 6 months. This food is delicious, and I didn't know all this information about the ingredients."" If we can convert that person into coming in 3 times a year or 4 times a year, we think that's a big opportunity as well. So the vast majority of our attention goes on doing what we do but do it better than ever."

But companywide and overall, like I said in my opening comments, we were -- basically, we were -- I think we were glad to hang on to the significant gains we made during 2014 when we had the very significant increases in throughput. But we didn't see an increase in overall throughput companywide during the quarter, which it's always disappointing not to see that. But I think with -- like Jack said, with even slightly negative comps, what happens, I think, with our teams is it's more difficult for them to break throughput records, and it becomes a little less top of mind for them, as they start to focus on other aspects of the business, waiting for that traffic to increase. So it certainly is a lot more fun to go out and set throughput records when they're shattering them on a daily basis. And when there is a slight falloff in traffic, even if it's just a flattening of traffic even for a short time, I think that sometimes our eye is not on the ball to the degree it could be. So we do see improvements in a lot of our 4 pillars execution, which is great. We see some really good 15-minute transaction numbers and records in areas. But overall, I think that I would be eager to see our teams push harder on the throughput such as to deliver even incremental increases in the third quarter. So we'll keep working on that."

I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we've continued to grow our business in the competitive environment while maintaining some of the best margins in the industry. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 12% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and the opening of 53 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.59 per share, an increase of 11%. 
With year-to-date revenue of $3.5 billion, comp sales growth of 5.5% and earnings per share growth of 26%, we are well on track to deliver another strong year. More than that, I'm proud of the fact that we continue to deliver such strong results by maintaining true to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We're realizing this vision through constant attention to our unique food and people cultures and by innovating to improve upon these key drivers of our business even in the face of challenges. During the quarter, we made significant strides to overcome a major obstacle tight our ability to obtain pork that meets all of our animal health care standards. Earlier this month, we announced that we have returned carnitas to 90% of our restaurants nationwide. As discussed in the last earnings call, we have begun to source pork from Karro Foods in the U.K. that is raised in the way that meets or exceeds all of our animal health care standards. Just like our current protocols, Karro does not use antibiotics nontherapeutically to promote growth in healthy animals. Karro follows European standards that allow antibiotics to be administered under veterinary supervision when necessary. We have been very happy with the quality of the property been providing in the care and respect with which Karro is treating their animals. Since beginning our relationship with Karro, we have also secured an additional pork supplier, and we expect to have enough pork to return carnitas to all of our restaurants by the end of November. We know that many of our customers love our carnitas, and we're disappointed we had stopped serving it in a number of our restaurants around the country. To all of our customers who have been inconvenienced by our carnitas shortage, I'd like to personally thank you for your patience and your support. We knew this issue would be difficult for our customers and our restaurants, but we also knew that suspending sales of carnitas in some of our restaurants rather than serving commodity pork was the right thing to do. And we're thrilled to see that so many of our loyal customers agreed with our decision. After highlighting this issue, we have begun discussions with a number of additional suppliers across the country that are interested in working with us to improve the animal welfare conditions and meet the standards we require for our pork. I'm so excited about this encouraging change, particularly when compared to the reaction we received when starting our Food with Integrity program a little more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was variable pork available that met our acquirements. But today, some of the largest agricultural producers are taking a much closer look at the way they raise their animals, and they are starting to see that we have what we have always believed that food grown and raised with respect for animals, the environment, farmers and customers simply tastes better. We're excited to be close to returning to carnitas to 100% of our restaurants. And to let our customers know that carnitas is back, we have been promoting its return in our restaurants through social media and with PR, so customers who have been awaiting this return know where it is available.
Of course, changing the way people think about it eat fast food requires more than overcoming supply change challenges. We focus a lot of our marketing efforts on educating customers through entertaining and creative purchase, which Mark will talk about a little bit later. And we're delighted that we continue to see evidence of Chipotle's impact on food issues. Most recently, the State of California passed SB 27, making it the first state in the company to pass legislation to limit antibiotic use in healthy life stocks and to ban the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth. We began serving meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics in 1999 when we started serving pork from Nyman Ranch. Today, we serve more meat from animals raised without antibiotics than any other restaurant company. While we have been encouraged by even small steps made by other restaurant companies through this antibiotic use in farming and moves from some of the larger -- largest meat producers to embrace antibiotics practices to reduce antibiotic protocols.
The California bill is an important -- is important as it is the first to mandate responsible antibiotic use in livestock. This is an important step forward in the evolution of animal agriculture, and we hope that others will take similar steps in the foreseeable future. 
During the quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, a small 5-day per week location in the financial district, which is intensely lunch-driven like our first stores inside the Loop in Chicago. It is off to a solid start and has been breaking our throughput records in the U.K. Additionally, just last week, we opened our fourth restaurant in Paris into a new neighborhood for us. Our growth seeds in Europe continue to build brand recognition and are at the front end of developing a loyal customer base. Our growth seeds here in the U.S. continue to show promise, and we have continued to expand ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. ShopHouse recently opened its fourth location in Los Angeles, bringing the total number of ShopHouse restaurants to 11, and we plan to open 2 ShopHouse restaurants in Chicago before year-end. Pizzeria Locale expanded to its second market during the most recent quarter, opening its first restaurant in Kansas City, and we plan 2 pizzas -- pizzerias in Cincinnati in the coming months. Very exciting to apply our strong food culture and our unique and empowering people culture to these growth seeds. We are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and our commitment to that vision is the best way to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. 
Last, we recently hired our first ever Chief Information Officer. Curt Garner will be joining Chipotle on November 23. He comes from Starbucks where he held the same position. In his 18 years at Starbucks, Curt helped build the technology infrastructure that began with fewer than 2,000 stores to one that now supports a global business. We believe that Curt's background and expertise will be a great asset to Chipotle as we continue to seek ways to accelerate our use of technology to help strengthen our business. We're very excited for Curt to join us and look forward to the value he will bring to Chipotle.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are setting ourselves up to be able to provide a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience while also maintaining a strong economic model. Like our food culture, building the right people culture is an ongoing journey and is one that requires us to constantly push ourselves to find ways to get better and to raise the bar on the quality of the experience we provide. During the quarter, we've hosted -- we hosted our biennial field leadership conference to bring together all of our field leaders and support departments to talk about how we can strengthen our culture. It was a wonderful inspirational 2 days focused on how our field leaders can make a bigger impact in the restaurants and help our teams on the road to Restaurateur. We discussed the importance of instilling and inspiring vision, creating encouraging circumstances and how to best utilize our diagnosis and plan tool to identify negative things that are standing in the way of a restaurant achieving Restaurateur status. 
Our unique people culture also continue to gain traction within our growth seeds. As Steve mentioned, during the third quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, and I recently visited the fantastic team there and was pleased to be able to sign them off as Restaurateur. Our European operations team, which is led by Jacob a team leader and Restaurateur, has been building outstanding teams to ensure that customer experience we are providing in these new markets meets our high standards and continues to develop strong culture in these restaurants quickly. To help us better plan for future growth, we recently hired Jerome Cassagne as our head of European business development. Jerome has decades of restaurant industry experience in Europe and is spearheading our planning process, including navigating the nuances of operating a new restaurant brand across several countries and identifying lower-cost real estate options in markets that are very expensive.
As European customers continue to discover and turn into repeat customers at Chipotle, we are excited for the leadership and insight that Jacob and bring, and we look forward to great things to come for this team.
As of the end of the quarter, we are proud to have a strong roster of nearly 500 Restaurateurs with an additional 30 restaurants ready to be signed off by an officer. Our past investment and field leadership is beginning to bear fruit, and we are confident those improved restaurant cultures will lead to better service and a more compelling experience for our customers.
Beyond our efforts to strengthen our restaurant leadership, we recently took a very visible step towards bolstering the in our restaurant as we held our first-ever National Career Day in September. We set ambitious goals to interview more than 30,000 candidates for this and through the event and surrounding publicity, we ended up hiring 4,977 incremental crew members. Not only are we excited about our new hires, but this event also created the significant opportunity for us to showcase our people culture and the unique career opportunities we provide. Although the overall labor market show signs of tightening, we have found that top performers are consistently attracted to the challenging work environment a growth potential offered at Chipotle. One of the leadership roles in our restaurants is the reliance will be referred to as a takeout specialist whose job it is to take care of our out-of-store orders, which are a growing part of our business. As you may know, virtually every one of our restaurants is equipped with the second line, which is an abbreviated version of the front line, where we serve our regular customers. Fortunately, the second make lines are gradually getting more used, and we're now averaging nearly $500 in days -- $500 a day in sales per restaurant on the second make line company-wide. In some of our high-volume restaurant, the sales in the second mate line are much, much higher such that is a virtually a second restaurant within the restaurant, which is a phenomenal way for us to leverage our existing kitchens. When we receive online fax or catering orders, a takeout specialist is magic the timing of orders through production and all other aspects of the guest experience, and preparing the orders to be picked up. Not only is the sales channel exciting, but it offers the additional benefit of improving throughput as the more people who use the second make line, the better the customer experience is for the rest of our customers who can quickly receive and enjoy a meal.
During the third quarter, our teams increased throughput during our peak dinner hour by 1 transaction, while nonpeak throughput counts increased by 9 transactions. Unfortunately, we declined by 1 transaction during our peak lunch hour, and our teams would be working on instilling a sense of urgency to continue to improve this important aspect of customer service during the peak lunch hour. We know that as our volumes continue to grow, our teams need to continue to achieve incremental gains to improve the overall customer experience. Better throughput is one key driver that helps us improve our unit economic model that over the years contribute to some of our best cash-on-cash returns. Another component for terrific return on investment is the great job that our development team has done on identifying locations for you restaurants while maintaining a reasonable capital investment cost. We a fantastic development program as our real estate design and construction teams are finding favorable new restaurant sites and negotiating some of our best lease terms. During the quarter, we opened up 53 restaurants for a total of 150 restaurants through the first 9 months of this year. This is the fastest that we've ever added new stores, and we're not done yet. Our teams have been working diligently, and we're increasing our guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of 215 to 225 new Chipotles.
What's even more encouraging is that we're able to complete these restaurants in what is arguably one of the most competitive real estate markets we've seen in recent years. Our teams have given us feedback that the competition for new site locations remains high, and the demand for talented contractors, subcontractors and crews is intense as many developers are taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus identify an optimal mix of and in-line restaurants that have actually allowed us to lower our average investment cost. Also, Chipotle remains a preferred tenant for many landlords, and that places us in a strong position to negotiate favorable lease and tenant improvement terms and also helps get into properties even where demand is very high. As we think about 2016 new unit development, we expect to open you restaurants at an even faster pace and are currently projecting a range of 220 to 235 new restaurants for next year.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

During the quarter, we continued our efforts to educate consumers about our food and our unique food culture through innovative programs. In our promotion we called ""friends or faux,"" we challenged consumers to identify real friendly ingredients that align with our Food with Integrity vision and faux ingredients, artificial flavors preservatives and additives by comparing our food to a representative set of food meals such as burgers sub sandwiches and that are often manufactured with highly processed ingredients. People who can play the game could win a ""buy one get one"" offer at Chipotle simply by comparing what's in our food against what's in traditional fast food. The idea for this promotion will show -- was to show the simplicity of Chipotle's food, all of which is classically prepared from just 68 ingredients across our entire menu compared to a typical fast food where a single menu item can have upwards of 100 ingredients, many of which are chemical additives. The program launched in July, and consumer participation exceeded our expectations with more than 750,000 people playing the game within the first 24 hours. In total, the program generated an average of 180,000 page views a day, totaling 7.5 million views over the duration of the program. The campaign message was clear with a large majority of respondents in the follow-up survey saying they understood the intent of ""friends or faux""  And that already positive use of Chipotle were strengthened by the program with 3/4 of respondents saying that it made them more interested in eating at Chipotle. But although sales did increase with these promotions in July, our long-term goal remains to engage our customers and educate them about the quality and simplicity of our foods. We also introduced a retro style videogame called Taste Invaders as another entertaining way to point out to customers some of the artificial ingredients found in a typical fast food. The game, which is referred to as a galactic battle against artificial ingredients has been played more than 2 million times and provides another path to learn more about Chipotle, about the food Chipotle serves compared to the vast majority of other chain restaurants. We also continue to advertise nationwide throughout the summer months using traditional online radio and outdoor media. Our goal to educate customers about where our food comes from and the simplicity of our ingredients is also being carried over to our annual promotion and fundraiser this month. Because we always believe that artificial ingredients simply aren't necessary for delicious favorable food, we're asking our customers to add something unnecessary to their costumes October 31 in order to qualify for a $3 burrito. [indiscernible] favorite promotion for our customers and we expect will contribute $1 million to benefit the Chipotle Foundation.
Increasingly, our customers are ordering using their iPhone and Android devices or visiting our website to order online, and we continue to make improvements to enhance and simplify those user experiences. Our mobile and online sales continue to grow for the seventh consecutive quarter and currently represent more than 5% of top line sales, up more than 40% over last year. As we move forward, further investments in those platforms will be made with an eye toward developing tools and technologies to help our restaurant teams better manage and execute our out-of-store orders. Over the next year, we will also continue to improve and simplify our customers' ability to order the meals online. These investments are still at an early stage, but we believe they will help us increase the quality of experience for our guests ordering out of store and will help us grow this promising piece of our business. We've also added a new delivery partnership for customers who prefer that convenience. Ahead of the fall semester colleges and universities across the country, we entered into a delivery partnership with a delivery service that target college campuses and that is already well liked and widely used. We are now delivering to 40 major campuses across country through this partnership. Because it's so tailored to students service includes additional conveniences such as the ability to partner with university payment programs and deliver to dorm rooms and school buildings. marks our third delivery partnership and collectively, these valued delivery partners enable us to offer a delivery service throughout much of the country. Customers also continue to discover our catering. As of tomorrow, it'll be 2 years since we rolled out catering options on a national level, which is available everywhere with the exception of New York City. And while we continue to gain traction in catering, we know there's still work to be done. Part of that work is to test and ultimately roll out online platform that will allow our customers to order and pay for their catering in advance and ultimately, to have those orders delivered. Setting up a delivery for catering is not a simple task, however, particularly when you consider that many of our catering orders are intended to serve up to 200 people. That's a lot of food to be delivered hot, fresh and delicious in a way that meets our high standards and reflects positively on our brand. So we're going to need a partner that has the scale, reach and capability to deliver those large orders, and so we'll be carefully pursuing potential partners and hope to have trials complete in late 2016.

Overall sales for the quarter were up 12% to $1.2 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a 2.6% comp. Year-to-date sales were $3.5 billion and an increase of 15% over 2014. Our comp increase in the quarter was driven by a 1.9% increase in customer visits, accelerated for the second quarter.

During the third quarter, we also began implementing a targeted menu price increase in steak and barbacoa due to the sustained state inflation, and we'll continue to roll this out -- roll this increase out across the remaining markets during the fourth quarter. This price increase is expected to contribute about 130 basis points on fully loadout. And for the third quarter, this targeted menu price increase contributed about 70 basis points to the comp.

But overall, they're averaging about the same as what we saw during August and September, so slightly lower than the overall 2.6% comp in Q3. With the recent return of carnitas to 90% in our restaurant an an expectation of getting back to 100% soon, we would expect Q4 comps will be similar to what we saw in Q3. For the full year we continue to expect our overall comp will be in a low to mid-single digits. And as we look out to 2016, we expect the comps remain in the low single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.59, an increase of 11%, and year-to-date earnings per share was $12.92, a 26% increase over 2014. With 2000 restaurants in the horizon and our restaurants currently achieving record volumes, we're very confident about what lies ahead as we continue our vision to change people think about and eat fast food.
Restaurant-level margins in the quarter were 28.3%, a decrease [ph] of 50 basis points as higher labor and marketing costs were partially offset by lower food cost. Food costs were 33% in the quarter, down 10 basis points sequentially from Q2 and down 130 basis points compared to 2014. The decrease in the prior year was largely driven by lower cost for avocados and dairy, offset by sustained inflation for We saw minimal inflation for the rest of our food during the quarter, and we expect our food cost to stay in line with recent results through the end of the year. Our pricing for avocados has benefited this year as robust supply for Mexico helped to keep prices down, while dairy prices remain low due to strong production and increased domestic supply strong U.S. dollar has reduced dairy exports. For 2016, we expect food cost inflation will be relatively flat, and our food cost could decrease slightly depending on what happens to our beef cost. U.S. cost for beef and cattle continue to build, and we may see some relief in the cost of [indiscernible] in beef late in 2016. Labor cost were 22.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor costs were up 40 basis points. After our last call in July, we made significant progress in reducing our labor costs and efficiencies and return to what we consider to be normal labor management and scheduling practices. This resulted in Q3 labor being lower than Q2 by 40 basis points. Labor delevered versus last year by 100 basis points as a result of wage inflation with our hourly wages up nearly 5% over last year along with the cost of adding enhanced benefit such as tuition reimbursement, paid sick leave and increased paid vacation for our hourly restaurant employees as we discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Going forward, we expect labor to be slightly higher than Q3 in the fourth quarter during the seasonally lower sales period. 
[indiscernible] costs were flat in the quarter compared to last year and not to mention, we're lowering our development cost, which will strengthen our unit economic model. Other operating cost were 11.1% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, largely due to the timing of marketing and promotions this year, including our ""friends or faux"" game and increased spending surrounding some advertising to keep Chipotle top of mind. Marketing was 1.5% of sales in the quarter, up 20 basis points from last year and is expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter. Promotion costs were 90 basis points during the quarter, up from 50 basis points last year. For 2016, we anticipate marketing expenses to remain right around 1.5% to 1.6% of sales. G&A expense were 5.8% during the quarter, down 80 basis points the prior year. And remember that 2014 included our biennial All Managers' Conference, which also will occur in 2016. The conference costs around $10 million in 2014 and is expected to cost around $12 million in 2016. Lower stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus costs are also benefiting G&A for the quarter and for the year-to-date. Our noncash noneconomic stock comp expense of $20.7 million in the quarter, down slightly from last year. And for the first 9 months, stock comp expense was $58.6 million, down from $83 million last year, and we expect the full year charge this year will be about $78 million. During 2016, we expect our G&A including stock-based comp to grow at a slower rate than sales before considering the impact of the All Managers' Conference. Stock comp for 2016 will depend on the stock price at the time of the grant and the number and the types of equity awards issued. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and we expect our effective full year rate to also be 38.7%, and that compared to 37.6% for the full year 2014. The tax rate in 2014 benefited from an increase in the estimated -- estimate of useful tax credits and opportunity and the R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed by Congress for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points. And our estimated effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to remain at around 38.7%.
During the quarter, we repurchased about a $30 million of our stock or approximately 46,000 shares at an average share price of $670. At the end of the third quarter, we had $155 million remaining on our share buyback program. We finished the quarter with $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt on the balance sheet, and we continue to believe this use of cash investment in opening our high-returning Chipotle restaurant in the U.S. and will continue to nurture our growth seeds including ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale and our international Chipotle restaurants so they will become a compelling use of capital in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to repurchase shares of our stock opportunistically to enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have."

It did look like in the markets that it did get carnitas back that we did see some improvement during the second week of October, but October has been so choppy so far that's hard to tell. We did expect that based on when we suspended the sale of carnitas, we did see what we thought could be as much as a 200 basis point negative impact on the comps, so we're hoping we'll see that return, but it will take a little bit more time for us to fully see that happen. In terms of the wage inflation, a lot of that was proactive. We did have some isolated areas. We had San Francisco. We had parts of D.C. where there were minimal wage increases. And in most markets, we're above minimum wage, so it doesn't happen have an immediate impact. But just because of general competition for employees, just the expectation that we want to hire top performers, we want to be employer of choice, we want to be very proactive in making sure that not only are starting wages are competitive, but we also took a look at the number of our hourly managers during the summer to make sure that we're paying fair rates to them as well. So that was proactive in terms of what to expect going forward. I think it depends what the labor market looks like. I wouldn't expect it would stay at fully 5% year-after-year, so I don't know if it would compound all the way to 5%, but I don't know that it's going to drop all the way down to 2%, which is what it had been running for the last, I'd say, 2 or 3 or 4 years."

And obviously, coming off -- we're sort of coming off our seasonality in terms of the credits coming through our restaurants. And then simultaneously with sort of lower transaction comp that we've been experiencing, I think what happens is sometimes our teams get focused on a number of other things staffing being ""A Model,"" training new managers, onboarding new crews and then I think sometimes when things aren't moving -- when the crews isn't quite as rapid, people get a little less excited about pushing on -- pushing throughput and really watching their 4 pillars execution. So I think it's kind of a long way of saying I think we put our eye off the ball a little bit. It could happen sometimes, especially after a year of sort of blistering comps of sort of 19.8% a year ago during this time. Doing those times, it's very easy to keep throughput top of mind and have our crews be focused intensely on it. We had contests running, we had people excited about bringing throughput records and just a lot of focus on it, and I think that the focus has waned a little bit, and that is not -- that's not saying we want to see continue because throughput even during slower growth times, we have lines, and we had lines that caused some people to walk away. And we are going to work to replenish and reinvigorate our teams to focus on throughput and on execution of the 4 pillars of throughput because it is still an enormously huge competitive advantage for us and a huge part of customer service. So even if it's only a fall-off of one transaction, we do look to gain transactions. And as you've seen from the previous several years, we gained -- even at our core lunch hour, we had gained transactions almost every quarter. And so we don't like to see it fall off, one. But we're glad to have attained the real significant gains we made during 2013 and '14, but we'd like to improve on that still more."

But if you combine the last 3 years, and this is kind of the end of that trend, our 3-year comps are up in the high 27%, 28% range. We now need to start a new trend because we started that momentum. And if you look quarter by quarter-to-quarter, you can see that the momentum built for several quarters, that levels off. It peaked last year at 19.8. And then as you're comparing to multiple years of double-digit comps, and none of this is based on gimmicks, on promotions on discounting or like that, it's really just inviting more customers, and they have great experience, they want to come back. There's an education that market and the team have done with things like scarecrow and things that raise the awareness of where food comes from, why our food is different, and our customers have been able during this 3-year trend to connect the dots between why the food they love so much tastes so good, because they come from these great ingredients, because the food is prepared using classic cooking techniques or real cooking going on in their restaurants. So right now, we're this challenge where we got 3 years of growing our sales by 27%, 28% and comparing to that is difficult. So what we're hoping will happen is we'll be able to ignite another trend, another 3-year trend. When that will happen with the order of magnitude of that happening is very difficult to predict. But over the last 10, 15 years, Chipotle has seen these kind of ways of comps, and most of it is around bringing awareness and appreciation for what we do at Chipotle."

They don't know that we're doing real cooking. This happens to all the time. We've got an email from a former colleague of ours within Florida, and he says, ""Out of 10 people, as many as 7 or 8 or 9 of them have never been to Chipotle before."" So there's still this opportunity to educate people one that that is changing over time because as we are in more markets, more people know about Chipotle, but they don't necessarily know that we're using classic cooking techniques. They don't necessarily know that we do things like source naturally raised meats, and we have a local program during the right season and things like that. And so that's something that we all bump into people all the time that don't fully understand that. So there's still awareness around why Chipotle is different. There's a lot of competitors out there the messaging more difficult that our messaging that we're doing something that's more natural or that would imply that this higher quality there so that this makes the message more clear. But we believe that the source of where our comp will come from will still come from educating people about Chipotle, increasing the awareness about why we are different from others. And we had a great experience where people come in and try Chipotle, and they have a great dining experience, they tend to want to come back. And so while yes, it's more challenging; yes, we have higher volumes; yes, there are more competitors; generally, our job, our challenge is to get more people to understand and come to Chipotle more often."

We'll take the same approach that we hope with we talked about it on the last quarter, and it was in the San Francisco area and also in the -- I think it was the mid-Atlantic area a couple of markets that had pretty significant increases in minimum wage. Generally, we're not affected by minimum wage, but in some cases, minimum wages are being increased to $10, $11, $12 per hour, and those will have an impact. We don't automatically increase prices in those markets. What we do is we look at all the cost of doing business in that area. And the 2 cases that we mentioned last quarter, we increased prices there because not only are wages up, but those areas already have higher cost of doing business, things like higher occupancy cost and local taxes and things like that. And when we look to competition, the competition was pretty aggressive in raising prices, so we do the same thing with minimum wage increases on a market-by-market basis, and we'll make the decisions market-by-market basis based on the wages, other cost of business, what the competitors are doing and what our current margins, we'll consider all those factors."

They're still in the nurturing phase. They're still in the brand-building phase. When we open up a new restaurant, it behaves a lot like Chipotle. 12, 15 years ago, when we went into a new market it's an unfamiliar brand, it takes a while for customers to figure out what ShopHouse is. Pizzeria Locale, while it's pizza, it's that may be familiar to customers used to traditional pizza. So there's still a brand building and an understanding of what we're doing, very similar to what we saw an Chipotle in early days. We see encouraging signs like we're seeing some very strong comps in the markets that we've opened is why we've done things like with ShopHouse, we're going to open a new market in Chicago. And so it gives us now 3 different markets where the brand building and awareness is being created. With Pizzeria Locale, same thing. We will -- very soon, we're in 2 markets right now. we'll be in the third market. I think we're planting the right seeds. We're doing it in a number of markets where more and more customers will be able to visit these restaurants to figure out what's different about ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale. And as we see, the awareness the comps continue to build, just like we do with Chipotle early days, we'll continue to invest in those markets. And very similar reaction to what we're seeing in Europe, we're seeing very attractive sales comps, we're seeing some inconsistency in stores open. Some open hot and open up pretty high right away, and some will take a little time to build. So there's still what we consider to be an early brand building stage, but we're seeing some encouraging sign."

I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we've continued to grow our business in a competitive environment while maintaining some of the best margins in the industry. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 12% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and the opening of 53 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.59 per share, an increase of 11%.
With year-to-date revenue of $3.5 billion, comp sales growth of 5.5% and earnings per share growth of 26%, we are well on track to deliver another strong year. More than that, I'm proud of the fact that we continue to deliver such strong results by maintaining true to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We're realizing this vision through constant attention to our unique food and people cultures and by innovating to improve upon these key drivers of our business even in the face of challenges. 
During the quarter, we made significant strides to overcome a major obstacle tied to our ability to obtain pork that meets all of our animal welfare standards. Earlier this month, we announced that we have returned carnitas to 90% of our restaurants nationwide. As discussed on the last earnings call, we have begun to source pork from Karro Foods in the U.K. that is raised in a way that meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards. Just like our current protocols, Karro does not use antibiotics non-therapeutically to promote growth in healthy animals. Karro follows European standards that allow antibiotics to be administered under veterinary supervision, when necessary. We have been very happy with the quality of the pork they've been providing in the care and respect with which Karro is treating their animals. Since beginning our relationship with Karro, we have also secured an additional pork supplier, and we expect to have enough pork to return carnitas to all of our restaurants by the end of November. 
We know that many of our customers love our carnitas and were disappointed we had stopped serving it in a number of our restaurants around the country. To all of our customers who have been inconvenienced by our carnitas shortage, I'd like to personally thank you for your patience and your support. We knew this issue would be difficult for our customers and our restaurants, but we also knew that suspending sales of carnitas in some of our restaurants, rather than serving commodity pork was the right thing to do. And we're thrilled to see that so many of our loyal customers agreed with our decision. After highlighting this issue, we have begun discussions with a number of additional suppliers across the country that are interested in working with us to improve the animal welfare conditions and meet the standards we require for our pork. I'm so excited about this encouraging change, particularly when compared to the reaction we received when starting our Food with Integrity program a little more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was very little pork available that met our requirements. But today, some of the largest agricultural producers are taking a much closer look at the way they raise their animals, and they're starting to see that we have -- what we have always believed that food grown and raised with respect for animals, the environment, farmers and customers simply tastes better. We're excited to be close to returning to carnitas to 100% of our restaurants. And to let our customers know that carnitas is back, we have been promoting its return in our restaurants through social media and with PR, so customers who have been awaiting its return know where it is available.
Of course, changing the way people think about and eat fast food requires more than overcoming supply change challenges. We focus a lot of our marketing effort on educating customers through entertaining and creative approaches, which Mark will talk about a little bit later. And we're delighted that we continue to see evidence of Chipotle's impact on food issues. 
Most recently, the State of California passed SB-27, making it the first state in the country to pass legislation to limit antibiotic use in healthy livestocks and to ban the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth. We began serving meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics in 1999 when we started serving pork from Niman Ranch. Today, we serve more meat from animals raised without antibiotics than any other restaurant company. While we have been encouraged by even small steps made by other restaurant companies through the use -- antibiotic use in farming and moves from some of the larger -- largest meat producers to embrace antibiotic-free practices or reduced antibiotic protocols.
The California bill is an important -- is important, as it is the first to mandate more responsible antibiotic use in livestock. This is an important step forward in the evolution of animal agriculture, and we hope that others will take similar steps in the foreseeable future.
During the quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, a small 5-day-per-week location in the financial district, which is intensely lunch-driven, like our first stores inside The Loop in Chicago. It is off to a solid start and has been breaking peak hour throughput records in the U.K. Additionally, just last week, we opened our fourth restaurant in Paris, entering a new neighborhood for us. Our growth seeds in Europe continue to build brand recognition and are at the front end of developing a loyal customer base. 
Our growth seeds here in the U.S. continue to show promise, and we have continued to expand ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. ShopHouse recently opened its fourth location in Los Angeles, bringing the total number of ShopHouse restaurants to 11, and we plan to open 2 ShopHouse restaurants in Chicago before year end. Pizzeria Locale expanded to its second market during the most recent quarter, opening its first restaurant in Kansas City, and we plan to open 2 pizzas -- Pizzerias in Cincinnati in the coming months. Very exciting to apply our strong food culture and our unique and empowering people culture to these growth seeds. We are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and our commitment to that vision is the best way to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
Last, we recently hired our first-ever Chief Information Officer. Curt Garner will be joining Chipotle on November 23, and comes from Starbucks, where he held the same position. In his 18 years at Starbucks, Curt helped build the technology infrastructure that began with fewer than 2,000 stores to one that now supports a global business. We believe that Curt's background and expertise will be a great asset to Chipotle as we continue to seek ways to accelerate our use of technology to help strengthen our business. We're very excited for Curt to join us and look forward to the value he will bring to Chipotle.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are setting ours",1218,"Thank you, Steve. Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are setting ourselves up to be able to provide a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also maintaining a strong unit economic model. Like our food culture, building the right people culture is an ongoing journey, and is one that requires us to constantly push ourselves to find ways to get better and to raise the bar on the quality of the experience we provide. 
During the quarter, we've hosted -- we hosted our bi-annual field leadership conference to bring together all of our field leaders and support departments to talk about how we can strengthen our culture. It was a wonderful and inspirational 2 days, focused on how our field leaders can make a bigger impact in the restaurants and help our teams on the road to Restaurateur. We discussed the importance of instilling and inspiring vision, creating encouraging circumstances and how to best utilize our diagnosis and planning tool to identify negative themes that are standing in the way of a restaurant achieving Restaurateur status.
Our unique people culture also continues to gain traction within our growth seeds. As Steve mentioned, during the third quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, and I recently visited the fantastic team there and was pleased to be able to sign them off as Restaurateur. Our European operations team, which is led by Jacob Sumner, a team leader and Restaurateur, has been building outstanding teams to ensure that customer experience we are providing in these new markets meets our high standards, and he continues to develop Restaurateur culture in these restaurants quickly. 
To help us better plan for future growth, we recently hired Jerome Tafani as our Head of European Business Development. Jerome has decades of restaurant industry experience in Europe, and is spearheading our planning process, including navigating the nuances of operating a new restaurant brand across several countries and identifying lower-cost real estate options in markets that are very expensive.  As European customers continue to discover and turn into repeat customers at Chipotle, we are excited for the leadership and insight that Jacob and Jerome bring, and we look forward to great things to come from this team.
As of the end of the quarter, we are proud to have a strong roster of nearly 500 Restaurateurs, with an additional 30 restaurants ready to be signed off by an officer. Our past investment and field leadership is beginning to bear fruit, and we are confident those improved restaurant cultures will lead to better service and a more compelling experience for our customers.
Beyond our efforts to strengthen our restaurant leadership, we recently took a very visible step towards bolstering the best strength in our restaurant as we held our first-ever National Career Day in September. We set ambitious goals to interview more than 30,000 candidates for this, and through the event and surrounding publicity, we ended up hiring 4,977 incremental crew members. Not only are we excited about our new hires, but this event also created a significant opportunity for us to showcase our people culture and the unique career opportunities we provide. 
Although the overall labor market continues to show signs of tightening, we have found that top performers are consistently attracted to the challenging work environment and growth potential offered at Chipotle. One of the leadership roles within our restaurants is the reliance on what we refer to as a takeout specialist, whose job it is to take care of our out-of-store orders, which are a growing part of our business. 
As you may know, virtually every one of our restaurants is equipped with a second make line, which is an abbreviated version of the front line, where we serve our regular customers. Fortunately, those second make lines are gradually getting more used, and we're now averaging nearly $500 in days -- $500 a day in sales per restaurant on the second make line, company-wide. In some of our high-volume restaurants, the sales in the second make line are much, much higher, such that is a virtually a second restaurant within the restaurant, which is a phenomenal way for us to leverage our existing kitchens. 
When we receive online, fax or catering orders, the takeout specialist is managing the timing of orders, food production and all other aspects of the guest experience, and preparing the orders to be picked up. Not only is the sales channel exciting, but it offers the additional benefit of improving throughput, as the more people who use the second make line, the better the customer experience is for the rest of our customers who can more quickly receive and enjoy their meal.
During the third quarter, our teams increased throughput during our peak dinner hour by 1 transaction, while nonpeak throughput counts increased by 9 transactions. Unfortunately, we declined by 1 transaction during our peak lunch hour, and our teams will be working on instilling a sense of urgency to continue to improve this important aspect of customer service during the peak lunch hour. 
We know that as our volumes continue to grow, our teams need to continue to achieve incremental throughput gains to improve the overall customer experience. Better throughput is one key driver that helps us improve our unit economic model, and over the years, has contributed to some of our best cash-on-cash returns. 
Another component for terrific return on investment is the great job that our development team has done on identifying locations for you restaurants while maintaining a reasonable capital investment cost. We have built a fantastic development program as our real estate, design and construction teams are finding favorable new restaurant sites and negotiating some of our best lease terms. During the quarter, we opened up 53 new restaurants for a total of 150 restaurants through the first 9 months of this year. This is the fastest that we've ever added new stores, and we're not done yet. Our teams have been working diligently, and we're increasing our guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of 215 to 225 new Chipotles.
What's even more encouraging is that we're able to complete these restaurants in what is arguably one of the most competitive real estate markets we've seen in recent years. Our teams have given us feedback that the competition for new site locations remains high, and the demand for talented contractors, subcontractors and crews is intense, as many developers are taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus identifying an optimal mix of end-cap and in-line restaurants that have actually allowed us to lower our average investment cost. Also, Chipotle remains a preferred tenant for many landlords, and that places us in a strong position to negotiate favorable lease and tenant improvement terms and also helps get into properties even where demand is very high. 
As we think about 2016 new unit development, we expect to open new restaurants at an even faster pace, and are currently projecting a range of 220 to 235 new restaurants for next year.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

During the quarter, we continued our efforts to educate consumers about issues in food and our unique food culture through innovative marketing programs. In our promotion we've called ""friends or faux,"" we challenged consumers to identify real friendly ingredients that align with our Food with Integrity vision and faux ingredients, artificial flavors preservatives and additives by comparing our food to a representative set of food meals such as burgers, Sub sandwiches and pizzas that are often manufactured with highly processed ingredients. People who then play the game could win a ""Buy-One-Get-One"" offer at Chipotle simply by comparing what's in our food against what's in traditional fast food. The idea for this promotion will show -- was to show the simplicity of Chipotle's food, all of which is classically prepared from just 68 ingredients across our entire menu compared to a typical fast food where a single menu item can have upwards of 100 ingredients, many of which are chemical additives. 
The program launched in July, and consumer participation exceeded our expectations, with more than 750,000 people playing the game within the first 24 hours. In total, the program generated an average of 180,000 page views a day, totaling to 7.5 million views over the duration of the program. The campaign message was clear, with a large majority of respondents in the follow-up survey saying that they understood the intent of ""friends or faux,"" and that already positive views of Chipotle were strengthened by the program, with 3/4 of respondents saying that it made them more interested in eating at Chipotle. 
And although sales did increase with these promotions in July, our long-term goal remains to engage our customers and educate them about the quality and simplicity of our foods. 
We also introduced a retro-style video game called Taste Invaders as another entertaining way to point out to customers some of the artificial ingredients found in a typical fast food. The game, which is referred to as a galactic battle against artificial ingredients has been played more than 2 million times and provides another creative path to learn more about Chipotle -- about the food Chipotle serves compared to the vast majority of other chain restaurants. 
We also continued to advertise nationwide throughout the summer months using traditional online, radio and outdoor media. Our goal to educate customers about where our food comes from and the simplicity of our ingredients is also being carried over to our annual food retail promotion and fundraiser this month. Because we've always believed that artificial ingredients simply aren't necessary for delicious, favorable food, we are asking our customers to add something unnecessary to their costumes October 31 in order to qualify for a $3 Boorito. Boorito has been the favorite promotion for our customers, and we expect will contribute $1 million to benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.
Increasingly, our customers are ordering using their iPhone and Android devices or visiting our website to order online, and we continue to make improvements to enhance and simplify those user experiences. Our mobile and online sales continued to grow for the seventh consecutive quarter, and currently represent more than 5% of topline sales, up more than 40% over last year. As we move forward, further investments in those platforms will be made with an eye toward developing tools and technologies to help our restaurant teams better manage and execute our out-of-store orders. 
Over the next year, we will also continue to improve and simplify our customers' ability to order their meals online. These investments are still at an early stage, but we believe that they will help us increase the quality of the experience for our guests ordering out-of-store and will help us grow this promising piece of our business. 
We've also added a new delivery partnership for customers who prefer that convenience. Ahead of the fall semester at colleges and universities across the country, we entered into a delivery partnership with Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses and that is already well liked and widely used. We are now delivering to 40 major campuses across country through out -- through this partnership. Because it's so tailored to students, Tapingo service includes additional conveniences, such as the ability to partner with university payment programs and deliver to dorm rooms and school buildings. Tapingo marks our third delivery partnership and, collectively, these valued delivery partners enable us to offer a delivery service throughout much of the country. 
Customers also continued to discover our catering. As of tomorrow, it'll be 2 years since we rolled out catering options on a national level, which is available everywhere, with the exception of New York City. And while we continue to gain traction in catering, we know there's still work to be done. Part of that work is to test and, ultimately, roll out online platform that will allow customers to order and pay for their catering in advance and, ultimately, to have those orders delivered. Setting up delivery for catering is not a simple task, however, particularly when you consider that many of our catering orders are intended to serve up to 200 people. That's a lot of food to be delivered hot, fresh and delicious in a way that meets our high standards and reflects positively on our brand. So we're going to need a partner that has the scale, reach and capability to deliver those large orders, and so we'll be carefully pursuing potential partners, and hope to have trials complete in late 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,313333206,878395,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark.

Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparison from 2014. We continue to grow our comps this quarter by 2.6%, which is on top of last year's comp of 19.8%, our highest as a public company. We're able to continue to grow even as our restaurants are now achieving volumes of more than $2.5 million on average, all of which can only be accomplished by having top-performing crews and management teams in place that are driven to create an exceptional dining experience for our customers. 
Overall sales for the quarter were up 12% to $1.2 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a 2.6% comp. Year-to-date sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014. Our comp increase during in the quarter was driven by a 1.9% increase in customer visits, accelerated from the second quarter. Increasingly, more customers are connecting with our vision and appreciate the real food made from wholesome, delicious ingredients, using classic cooking techniques, and they appreciate that all of that just tastes better. 
Our sales comps were highest in July, when our ""friends or faux"" campaign was in full force, but were lower in August and September. We were happy with the customer response and engagement with ""friends or faux"" during July, as our customers who played the game learned about our simple, wholesome ingredients and were treated to a BOGO for playing. 
During the third quarter, we also began implementing a targeted menu price increase on steak and barbacoa due to the sustained beef inflation, and we'll continue to roll this out -- roll this increase out across the remaining markets during the fourth quarter. This price increase is expected to contribute about 130 basis points when fully rolled out. And for the third quarter, this targeted menu price increase contributed about 70 basis points to the comp. 
Traffic during the first  few weeks of October so far has been pretty choppy. But overall, they're averaging about the same as what we saw during August and September, so slightly lower than the overall 2.6% comp in Q3. With the recent return of carnitas to 90% in our restaurant and expectation of getting back to 100% soon, we would expect Q4 comps will be similar to what we saw in Q3. 
For the full year we continue to expect our overall comp will be in a low and mid-single digits, and as we look out to 2016, we expect the comps will remain in the low single digits. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.59, an increase of 11%, and year-to-date earnings per share was $12.92, a 26% increase over 2014. 
With 2,000 restaurants on the horizon and our restaurants currently achieving record volumes, we're very confident about what lies ahead as we continue toward our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
Restaurant-level margins in the quarter were 28.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, as higher labor and marketing costs were partially offset by lower food costs. 
Food costs were 33% in the quarter, down 10 basis points sequentially from Q2 and down 130 basis points compared to 2014. The decrease from the prior year was largely driven by lower cost for avocados and dairy, offset by sustained inflation for beef.  We saw a minimal inflation for the rest of our food during the quarter, and we expect our food cost to stay in line with recent results through the end of the year. 
Our pricing for avocados has benefited this year as robust supply from Mexico has helped to keep prices down, while dairy prices remained low due to strong production and increased domestic supplies and strong U.S. dollar has reduced dairy exports. 
For 2016, we expect food cost inflation will be relatively flat, and our food cost could decrease slightly depending on what happens to our beef cost. The U.S. herd count for beef and cattle continues to build, and we may see some relief in the cost of naturally raised beef late in 2016. 
Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor costs were up 40 basis points. 
After our last call in July, we made significant progress in reducing our labor costs and efficiencies and have returned to what we would consider to be normal labor management and scheduling practices. This resulted in Q3 labor being lower than Q2 by 40 basis points. 
Labor de-levered versus last year by 100 basis points as a result of wage inflation, with our hourly wages up nearly 5% over last year, along with the cost of adding enhanced benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, paid sick leave and increased paid vacation for our hourly restaurant employees as we discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Going forward, we expect labor to be slightly higher than Q3 in the fourth quarter during the seasonally lower sales period. 
Occupancy costs were flat in the quarter compared to last year, and not to mention, we're lowering our overall development costs, which will further strengthen our unit economic model. 
Other operating costs were 11.1% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, largely due to the timing of our marketing and promotions this year, including our ""friends or faux"" game and the increased spending surrounding summer advertising to keep Chipotle top of mind. 
Marketing was 1.5% of sales in the quarter, up 20 basis points from last year, and is expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter. Promotion costs were 90 basis points during the quarter, up from 50 basis points last year. For 2016, we anticipate marketing expenses to remain right around 1.5% to 1.6% of sales. 
G&A expense were 5.8% during the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year. And remember that 2014 included our biennial All Managers' Conference, which also will occur in 2016. The conference cost around $10 million in 2014, and is expected to cost around $12 million in 2016. 
Lower stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus costs are also benefiting G&A for the quarter and for the year-to-date. 
Our noncash non-economic stock comp expense of $20.7 million in the quarter, down slightly from last year. And for the first 9 months, stock comp expense was $58.6 million, down from $83 million last year. And we expect the full year charge this year will be about $78 million. 
During 2016, we expect our G&A, including stock-based comp to grow at a slower rate than sales before considering the impact of the All Managers' Conference. 
Stock comp for 2016 will depend on the stock price at the time of the grant and the number and the types of equity awards issued. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and we expect our effective full year rate to also be 38.7%, and that compared to 37.6% for the full year 2014. The tax rate in 2014 benefited from an increase in the estimated -- estimate of useful state tax credits and from the work opportunity and the R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed by Congress for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points. And our estimated tax -- effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to remain at around 38.7%.
During the quarter, we've repurchased about $30 million of our stock, or approximately 46,000 shares at an average share price of $670. At the end of the third quarter, we had $155 million remaining on our share buyback program. 
We finished the quarter with $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt on the balance sheet. And we continue to believe that the best use of cash is to invest in opening our high-returning Chipotle restaurants in the U.S., and we'll continue to nurture our growth seeds, including ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale and our international Chipotle restaurants, so they will become a compelling use of capital in the future.  In the meantime, we'll continue to repurchase shares of our stock opportunistically to enhance shareholder value.

On carnitas, it's hard to tell because we did return to 90, and we finished September like just under 60%. We did hit 90 in the second half of September. It did look like in the markets that it did get carnitas back that we did see some improvement during like the second week of October. But October's been so choppy, so far, that's hard to tell. We did expect that based on when we suspended the sale of carnitas, we did see what we thought could be as much as a 200 basis point negative impact on the comps, so we're hoping we'll see that return. But it will take a little bit more time for us to fully see that happen. In terms of the wage inflation, a lot of that was proactive. We did have some isolated areas. We had San Francisco. We had parts of D.C., where there were minimal wage increases. And in most markets, we're above minimum wage, so that doesn't have an immediate impact. But just because of general competition for employees, just the expectation that we want to hire top performers, we want to be employer of choice, we've been very proactive in making sure that not only are starting wages are competitive, but we also took a look at the number of our hourly managers during the summer to make sure that we're paying fair rates to them as well. So that was proactive in terms of what to expect going forward. Sharon, I think it just depends on what the labor market looks like. I wouldn't expect it would stay at fully 5% year-after-year, so I don't know it would compound all the way to 5%.

And I think that -- obviously, coming off -- we're sort of coming off our highest seasonality in terms of the crowds coming through our restaurants. And then simultaneously, with a sort of lower transaction comp that we've been experiencing, I think what happens is sometimes our teams get focused on a number of other things, staffing, being ""A Model,"" training new managers, on-boarding new crews. And then I think, sometimes, when things aren't moving -- when the crews isn't quite as rapid, people get a little sort of a less excited about pushing on -- pushing throughput and really watching their 4 pillars execution. So I think that it's kind of a long way of saying. It's -- I think we've -- took our eye off the ball a little bit. It could happen sometimes, especially after a year of sort of blistering comps and sort of 19.8% a year ago during this time. Doing those times, it's very easy to keep throughput top of mind and have our crews be focused intensely on it. We had contests running, we had people excited about breaking throughput records and just a lot of focus on it. And I think that the focus has waned a little bit, and that is not -- that's not saying we want to see it continue because throughput, even during slower growth times, we have lines, and we have lines that cause some people to walk away. And so we are going to work to sort of replenish and reinvigorate our teams to focus on throughput and on execution of the 4 pillars of throughput because it is still an enormously huge competitive advantage for us and a huge part of customer service. So even though it's only a fall-off of one transaction, we do look to gain transactions. And as you've seen from the previous several years, we've gained -- even at our core lunch hour, we have gained transactions almost every quarter. And so we don't like to see it fall off one. But we're glad to have attained the real significant gains we made during 2013 and '14, but we'd like to improve on that still more."

If you go back and look to 2013, we started a new trend where we started in low single-digit comps, and we kind of built our comps for the next several quarters. We had a price increase in 2014. But if you combine the last 3 years, and this is kind of the end of that trend, our 3-year comps are up in the high 27%, 28% range. We now need to start a new trend because we started that momentum. And if you look quarter by quarter-to-quarter, you can see that the momentum built for several quarters, it levels off. It peaked last year at 19.8%. And then as you're comparing to multiple years of double-digit comps, and none of this is based on gimmicks, on promotions, on discounting, or anything like that, it's really just inviting more customers, and they have great experience, they want to come back. There's an education that Mark and the team have done with things like Scarecrow and things that raise the awareness of where food comes from, why our food is different. And our customers have been able, during this 3-year trend, to connect the dots between why the food they love so much, why it tastes so good, because they come from these great ingredients, because the food is prepared using classic cooking techniques, there's real cooking going on in our restaurants. And so right now, we're in this challenge, where we've got 3 years of growing our sales by 27%, 28% and comparing to that is difficult. And so what we're hoping will happen is we'll be able to ignite another trend, another 3-year trend. When that will happen with the order of magnitude of that happening is very difficult to predict. But over the last 10, 15 years, Chipotle has seen these kind of ways of comps, and most of it is around creating awareness and appreciation for what we do at Chipotle."

And so there's still this opportunity to educate people, one that which says -- which, that is changing over time because, as we are in more markets, more people know about Chipotle, but they don't necessarily know that we're using classic cooking techniques. They don't necessarily know that we do things like source naturally raised meats, and we have a local program during the right season and things like that. And so that's something that we all bump into people all the time that don't fully understand that. So there's still awareness around why Chipotle is different. There are a lot of competitors out there and just makes I think the messaging more difficult than our messaging that they're doing something that is more natural or that would imply that there's higher quality there.

But we believe that the source of where our comp will come from will still come from educating people about Chipotle, increasing the awareness about why we are different from others.

We had a couple of markets that had pretty significant increases in minimum wage. Generally, we're not affected by minimum wage, but in some cases, the minimum wages are being increased to $10, $11, $12 per hour, and those will have some impact. We don't automatically increase prices in those markets. What we do is we look at all the cost of doing business in that area. And then the 2 cases that we mentioned last quarter, we increased prices there because, not only are wages up, but those areas already have higher costs of doing business, things like higher occupancy costs and local taxes and things like that. And we looked at competition, the competition was pretty aggressive in raising prices. So we'll do the same thing with minimum wage increases on a market-by-market basis.

They're still in the nurturing phase. They're still in the brand-building phase. When we open up a new restaurant, it behaves a lot like Chipotle 12, 15 years ago, when we went into a new market, where it's an unfamiliar brand. It takes a while for customers to figure out what ShopHouse is. Pizzeria Locale, while it's pizza, it's pizza that may be unfamiliar to customers that are used to traditional pizza. And so there's still a brand building and an understanding of what we're doing, very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days. We're seeing encouraging signs, like we're seeing some very strong comps in the markets that we've opened. It's why we've done things like, with ShopHouse, we're going to open a new market in Chicago. And so it gives us now 3 different markets where the brand building and awareness is being created. With Pizzeria Locale, same thing, we will -- very soon -- we're in 2 markets right now. We'll be in the third market. I think we're planting the right seeds.

And I would say this is a very similar reaction to what we're seeing in Europe. We're seeing very attractive sales comps, we're seeing some inconsistency in way the stores open. Some open hot and open up pretty high right away, and some will take a little time to build. So there's still what we consider to be in the early brand-building stage, but we're seeing some encouraging signs."

I mean, one thing, I think that's important to understand about our strategy here is that we deliberately spend less on our marketing, so that we can afford these higher-quality ingredients. And that's essentially the main benefit, the main marketing benefit to our customers. And so we find different ways to tell that story, entertaining ways to do it, but we have recently shifted our focus more to telling the basic story about where our ingredients come from and how they're made, and we've significantly increased our focus on digital marketing, which we've deemed to be very effective. We're going to be using some of our in-store assets to communicate some of these messages like our packaging. And so I think we're doing it. I think what you won't see from us, though, is some people might think ramping up would mean the television, or something like that. The problem with television, beyond the expense is that it's really, really tailored toward 30-second spots, which really only deliver if you have some sort of a promotional or call-to-action message in them, which is a very slippery slope. So we're going to stay the course on telling this brand story, but we're working on several large initiatives, some of -- similar to the ones you've seen in the past as well as what I just mentioned, which is an increased focus on digital and in-store communication. So I'd say we are ramping it up in some way, yes."

I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we've continued to grow our business in a competitive environment while maintaining some of the best margins in the industry. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 12% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and the opening of 53 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.59 per share, an increase of 11%.
With year-to-date revenue of $3.5 billion, comp sales growth of 5.5% and earnings per share growth of 26%, we are well on track to deliver another strong year. More than that, I'm proud of the fact that we continue to deliver such strong results by maintaining true to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We're realizing this vision through constant attention to our unique food and people cultures and by innovating to improve upon these key drivers of our business even in the face of challenges. 
During the quarter, we made significant strides to overcome a major obstacle tied to our ability to obtain pork that meets all of our animal welfare standards. Earlier this month, we announced that we have returned carnitas to 90% of our restaurants nationwide. As discussed on the last earnings call, we have begun to source pork from Karro Foods in the U.K. that is raised in a way that meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards. Just like our current protocols, Karro does not use antibiotics non-therapeutically to promote growth in healthy animals. Karro follows European standards that allow antibiotics to be administered under veterinary supervision, when necessary. We have been very happy with the quality of the pork they've been providing and the care and respect with which Karro is treating their animals. Since beginning our relationship with Karro, we have also secured an additional pork supplier, and we expect to have enough pork to return carnitas to all of our restaurants by the end of November. 
We know that many of our customers love our carnitas and were disappointed we had stopped serving it in a number of our restaurants around the country. To all of our customers who have been inconvenienced by our carnitas shortage, I'd like to personally thank you for your patience and your support. We knew this issue would be difficult for our customers and our restaurants, but we also knew that suspending sales of carnitas in some of our restaurants, rather than serving commodity pork was the right thing to do. And we're thrilled to see that so many of our loyal customers agreed with our decision. 
After highlighting this issue, we have begun discussions with a number of additional suppliers across the country that are interested in working with us to improve animal welfare conditions and meet the standards we require for our pork. I'm so excited about this encouraging change, particularly when compared to the reaction we received when starting our Food with Integrity program a little more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was very little pork available that met our requirements. But today, some of the largest agricultural producers are taking a much closer look at the way they raise their animals, and they're starting to see that we have -- what we have always believed that food grown and raised with respect for animals, the environment, farmers and customers simply tastes better. We're excited to be close to returning to carnitas to 100% of our restaurants. And to let our customers know that carnitas is back, we have been promoting its return in our restaurants through social media and with PR, so customers who have been awaiting its return know where it is available.
Of course, changing the way people think about and eat fast food requires more than overcoming supply change challenges. We focus a lot of our marketing effort on educating customers through entertaining and creative approaches, which Mark will talk about a little bit later. And we're delighted that we continue to see evidence of Chipotle's impact on food issues. 
Most recently, the State of California passed SB-27, making it the first state in the country to pass legislation to limit antibiotic use in healthy livestocks and to ban the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth. We began serving meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics in 1999 when we started serving pork from Niman Ranch. Today, we serve more meat from animals raised without antibiotics than any other restaurant company. While we have been encouraged by even small steps made by other restaurant companies to reduce antibiotic use in farming and moves from some of the largest meat producers to embrace antibiotic-free practices or reduced antibiotic protocols, the California bill is an important -- is important, as it is the first to mandate more responsible antibiotic use in livestock. This is an important step forward in the evolution of animal agriculture, and we hope that others will take similar steps in the foreseeable future.
During the quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, a small 5-day-per-week location in the financial district, which is intensely lunch-driven, like our first stores inside The Loop in Chicago. It is off to a solid start and has been breaking peak-hour throughput records in the U.K. Additionally, just last week, we opened our fourth restaurant in Paris, entering a new neighborhood for us. Our growth seeds in Europe continue to build brand recognition and are at the front end of developing a loyal customer base. 
Our growth seeds here in the U.S. continue to show promise, and we have continued to expand ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. ShopHouse recently opened its fourth location in Los Angeles, bringing the total number of ShopHouse restaurants to 11, and we plan to open 2 ShopHouse restaurants in Chicago before year-end. Pizzeria Locale expanded to its second market during the most recent quarter, opening its first restaurant in Kansas City, and we plan to open 2 pizzas -- Pizzerias in Cincinnati in the coming months. Very exciting to apply our strong food culture and our unique and empowering people culture to these growth seeds. We are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and our commitment to that vision is the best way to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
Last, we recently hired our first-ever Chief Information Officer. Curt Garner will be joining Chipotle on November 23, and comes from Starbucks, where he held the same position. In his 18 years at Starbucks, Curt helped build the technology infrastructure that began with fewer than 2,000 stores to one that now supports a global business. We believe that Curt's background and expertise will be a great asset to Chipotle as we continue to seek ways to accelerate our use of technology to help strengthen our business. We're very excited for Curt to join us and look forward to the value he will bring to Chipotle.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are setting ourselves up to be able to provide a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also maintaining a strong unit economic model. Like our food culture, building the right people culture is an ongoing journey, and is one that requires us to constantly push ourselves to find ways to get better and to raise the bar on the quality of the experience we provide. 
During the quarter, we've hosted -- we hosted our bi-annual field leadership conference to bring together all of our field leaders and support departments to talk about how we can strengthen our culture. It was a wonderful and inspirational 2 days, focused on how our field leaders can make a bigger impact in their restaurants and help our teams on the road to Restaurateur. We discussed the importance of instilling and inspiring vision, creating encouraging circumstances and how to best utilize our diagnosis and planning tool to identify negative themes that are standing in the way of a restaurant achieving Restaurateur status.
Our unique people culture also continues to gain traction within our growth seeds. As Steve mentioned, during the third quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, and I recently visited the fantastic team there and was pleased to be able to sign them off as Restaurateur. Our European operations team, which is led by Jacob Sumner, a team leader and Restaurateur, has been building outstanding teams to ensure that customer experience we are providing in these new markets meets our high standards, and he continues to develop Restaurateur cultures in these restaurants quickly. 
To help us better plan for future growth, we recently hired Jerome Tafani as our Head of European Business Development. Jerome has decades of restaurant industry experience in Europe, and is spearheading our planning process, including navigating the nuances of operating a new restaurant brand across several countries and identifying lower-cost real estate options in markets that are very expensive. As European customers continue to discover and turn into repeat customers at Chipotle, we are excited for the leadership and insight that Jacob and Jerome bring, and we look forward to great things to come from this team.
As of the end of the quarter, we are proud to have a strong roster of nearly 500 Restaurateurs, with an additional 30 restaurants ready to be signed off by an officer. Our past investment and field leadership is beginning to bear fruit, and we are confident those improved restaurant cultures will lead to better service and a more compelling experience for our customers.
Beyond our efforts to strengthen our restaurant leadership, we recently took a very visible step towards bolstering the bench strength in our restaurant as we held our first-ever National Career Day in September. We set ambitious goals to interview more than 30,000 candidates for this, and through the event and surrounding publicity, we ended up hiring 4,977 incremental crew members. Not only are we excited about our new hires, but this event also created a significant opportunity for us to showcase our people culture and the unique career opportunities we provide. 
Although the overall labor market continues to show signs of tightening, we have found that top performers are consistently attracted to the challenging work environment and growth potential offered at Chipotle. One of the leadership roles within our restaurants is the reliance on what we refer to as a takeout specialist, whose job it is to take care of our out-of-store orders, which are a growing part of our business. 
As you may know, virtually every one of our restaurants is equipped with a second make line, which is an abbreviated version of the front line, where we serve our regular customers. Fortunately, those second make lines are gradually getting more use, and we're now averaging nearly $500 in day -- $500 a day in sales per restaurant on the second make line company-wide. In some of our high-volume restaurants, the sales in the second make line are much, much higher, such that is a virtually a second restaurant within the restaurant, which is a phenomenal way for us to leverage our existing kitchens. 
When we receive online, fax or catering orders, the takeout specialist is managing the timing of orders, food production and all other aspects of the guest experience, and preparing the orders to be picked up. Not only is the sales channel exciting, but it offers the additional benefit of improving throughput, as the more people who use the second make line, the better the customer experience is for the rest of our customers who can more quickly receive and enjoy their meal.
During the third quarter, our teams increased throughput during our peak dinner hour by 1 transaction, while nonpeak throughput counts increased by 9 transactions. Unfortunately, we declined by 1 transaction during our peak lunch hour, and our teams will be working on instilling a sense of urgency to continue to improve this important aspect of customer service during the peak lunch hour. 
We know that as our volumes continue to grow, our teams need to continue to achieve incremental throughput gains to improve the overall customer experience. Better throughput is one key driver that helps us improve our unit economic model, and over the years, has contributed to some of our best cash-on-cash returns. 
Another component for terrific return on investment is the great job that our development team has done on identifying locations for new restaurants while maintaining reasonable capital investment costs. We have built a fantastic development program as our real estate, design and construction teams are finding favorable new restaurant sites and negotiating some of our best lease terms. During the quarter, we opened up 53 new restaurants for a total of 150 restaurants through the first 9 months of this year. This is the fastest that we've ever added new stores, and we're not done yet. Our teams have been working diligently, and we're increasing our guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of 215 to 225 new Chipotles.
What's even more encouraging is that we're able to complete these restaurants in what is arguably one of the most competitive real estate markets we've seen in recent years. Our teams have given us feedback that the competition for new site locations remains high, and the demand for talented contractors, subcontractors and crews is intense, as many developers are taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus on identifying an optimal mix of end-cap and in-line restaurants that have actually allowed us to lower our average investment cost. Also, Chipotle remains a preferred tenant for many landlords, and that places us in a strong position to negotiate favorable lease and tenant improvement terms. It also helps us get into properties even where demand is very high. 
As we think about 2016 new unit development, we expect to open new restaurants at an even faster pace, and are currently projecting a range of 220 to 235 new restaurants for next year.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

During the quarter, we continued our efforts to educate consumers about issues in food and our unique food culture through innovative marketing programs. In our promotion we've called ""Friend or Faux,"" we challenged consumers to identify real friendly ingredients that align with our Food with Integrity vision and faux ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives and additives by comparing our food to a representative set of food meals such as burgers, sub sandwiches and pizzas that are often manufactured with highly processed ingredients. People who play the game could win a ""Buy-One-Get-One"" offer at Chipotle simply by comparing what's in our food against what's in traditional fast food. The idea for this promotion will show -- was to show the simplicity of Chipotle's food, all of which is classically prepared from just 68 ingredients across our entire menu compared to typical fast food where a single menu item can have upwards of 100 ingredients, many of which are chemical additives. 
The program launched in July, and consumer participation exceeded our expectations, with more than 750,000 people playing the game within the first 24 hours. In total, the program generated an average of 180,000 page views a day, totaling 7.5 million views over the duration of the program. The campaign message was clear, with a large majority of respondents in the follow-up survey saying that they understood the intent of ""Friend or Faux,"" and that already positive views of Chipotle were strengthened by the program, with 3/4 of respondents saying that it made them more interested in eating at Chipotle. And although sales did increase with these promotions in July, our long-term goal remains to engage our customers and educate them about the quality and simplicity of our foods. 
We also introduced a retro-style video game called Taste Invaders as another entertaining way to point out to customers some of the artificial ingredients found in typical fast food. The game, which is referred to as a galactic battle against artificial ingredients, has been played more than 2 million times and provides another creative path to learn more about Chipotle -- about the food Chipotle serves compared to the vast majority of other chain restaurants. 
We also continued to advertise nationwide throughout the summer months using traditional online, radio and outdoor media. Our goal to educate customers about where our food comes from and the simplicity of our ingredients is also being carried over to our annual food retail promotion and fundraiser this month. Because we've always believed that artificial ingredients simply aren't necessary for delicious, flavorable food, we are asking our customers to add something unnecessary to their costumes October 31 in order to qualify for a $3 Boorito. Boorito has been the favorite promotion for our customers, and we expect will contribute $1 million to benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.
Increasingly, our customers are ordering using their iPhone and Android devices or visiting our website to order online, and we continue to make improvements to enhance and simplify those user experiences. Our mobile and online sales continued to grow for the seventh consecutive quarter, and currently represent more than 5% of topline sales, up more than 40% over last year. As we move forward, further investments in those platforms will be made with an eye toward developing tools and technologies to help our restaurant teams better manage and execute our out-of-store orders. 
Over the next year, we will also continue to improve and simplify our customers' ability to order their meals online. These investments are still at an early stage, but we believe that they will help us increase the quality of the experience for our guests ordering out-of-store and will help us grow this promising piece of our business. 
We've also added a new delivery partnership for customers who prefer that convenience. Ahead of the fall semester at colleges and universities across the country, we entered into a delivery partnership with Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses and that is already well liked and widely used. We are now delivering to 40 major campuses across the country throughout -- through this partnership. Because it's so tailored to students, Tapingo service includes additional conveniences, such as the ability to partner with university payment programs and deliver to dorm rooms and school buildings. Tapingo marks our third delivery partnership and, collectively, these valued delivery partners enable us to offer a delivery service throughout much of the country. 
Customers also continued to discover our catering. As of tomorrow, it'll be 2 years since we rolled out catering options on a national level, which is available everywhere, with the exception of New York City. And while we continue to gain traction in catering, we know there's still work to be done. Part of that work is to test and, ultimately, roll out an online platform that will allow customers to order and pay for their catering in advance and, ultimately, to have those orders delivered. Setting up delivery for catering is not a simple task, however, particularly when you consider that many of our catering orders are intended to serve up to 200 people. That's a lot of food to be delivered hot, fresh and delicious in a way that meets our high standards and reflects positively on our brand. So we're going to need a partner that has the scale, reach and capability to deliver those large orders, and so we'll be carefully pursuing potential partners, and hope to have trials complete in late 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."
26446,313333206,878411,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparison from 2014. We continue to grow our comps this quarter by 2.6%, which is on top of last",1390,"Thanks, Mark. Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparison from 2014. We continue to grow our comps this quarter by 2.6%, which is on top of last year's comp of 19.8%, our highest as a public company. We're able to continue to grow even as our restaurants are now achieving volumes of more than $2.5 million on average, all of which can only be accomplished by having top-performing crews and management teams in place that are driven to create an exceptional dining experience for our customers. 
Overall sales for the quarter were up 12% to $1.2 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a 2.6% comp. Year-to-date sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014. Our comp increase during in the quarter was driven by a 1.9% increase in customer visits, accelerated from the second quarter. Increasingly, more customers are connecting with our vision and they appreciate the real food made from wholesome, delicious ingredients, using classic cooking techniques, and they appreciate that all of that just tastes better. 
Our sales comps were highest in July, when our ""Friend or Faux"" campaign was in full force, but were lower in August and September. We were happy with the customer response and engagement with ""Friend or Faux"" during July, as our customers who played the game learned about our simple, wholesome ingredients and were treated to a BOGO for playing. 
During the third quarter, we also began implementing a targeted menu price increase on steak and barbacoa due to the sustained beef inflation, and we'll continue to roll this out -- roll this increase out across the remaining markets during the fourth quarter. This price increase is expected to contribute about 130 basis points when fully rolled out. And for the third quarter, this targeted menu price increase contributed about 70 basis points to the comp. 
Traffic during the first few weeks of October so far has been pretty choppy. But overall, they're averaging about the same as what we saw during August and September, so slightly lower than the overall 2.6% comp in Q3. With the recent return of carnitas to 90% in our restaurant and expectation of getting back to 100% soon, we would expect Q4 comps will be similar to what we saw in Q3. 
For the full year, we continue to expect our overall comp will be in the low and mid-single digits, and as we look out to 2016, we expect the comps will remain in the low single digits. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.59, an increase of 11%, and year-to-date earnings per share was $12.92, a 26% increase over 2014. 
With 2,000 restaurants on the horizon and our restaurants currently achieving record volumes, we're very confident about what lies ahead as we continue toward our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
Restaurant-level margins in the quarter were 28.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, and higher labor and marketing costs were partially offset by lower food costs. 
Food costs were 33% in the quarter, down 10 basis points sequentially from Q2 and down 130 basis points compared to 2014. The decrease from the prior year was largely driven by lower cost for avocados and dairy, offset by sustained inflation for beef. We saw a minimal inflation for the rest of our food during the quarter, and we expect our food cost to stay in line with recent results through the end of the year. 
Our pricing for avocados has benefited this year as robust supply from Mexico has helped to keep prices down. While dairy prices remained low due to strong production and increased domestic supplies, a strong U.S. dollar has reduced dairy exports. 
For 2016, we expect food cost inflation will be relatively flat, and our food cost could decrease slightly depending on what happens to our beef cost. U.S. herd count for beef and cattle continues to build, and we may see some relief in the cost of naturally raised beef late in 2016. 
Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor costs were up 40 basis points. After our last call in July, we made significant progress in reducing our labor costs inefficiencies and have returned to what we would consider to be normal labor management and scheduling practices. This resulted in Q3 labor being lower than Q2 by 40 basis points. 
Labor de-levered versus last year by 100 basis points as a result of wage inflation, with our hourly wages up nearly 5% over last year, along with the cost of adding enhanced benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, paid sick leave and increased paid vacation for our hourly restaurant employees as we discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Going forward, we expect labor to be slightly higher than Q3 in the fourth quarter during a seasonally lower sales period. 
Occupancy costs were flat in the quarter compared to last year, and not to mention, we're lowering our overall development costs, which will further strengthen our unit economic model. 
Other operating costs were 11.1% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, largely due to the timing of our marketing and promotions this year, including our ""Friend or Faux"" game and the increased spending surrounding summer advertising to keep Chipotle top of mind. 
Marketing was 1.5% of sales in the quarter, up 20 basis points from last year, and is expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter. Promotion costs were 90 basis points during the quarter, up from 50 basis points last year. For 2016, we anticipate marketing expenses remain right around 1.5% to 1.6% of sales. 
G&A expenses were 5.8% during the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year. And remember that 2014 included our biennial All Managers' Conference, which also will occur in 2016. The conference cost around $10 million in 2014, and is expected to cost around $12 million in 2016. Lower stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus costs are also benefiting G&A for the quarter and for the year-to-date. 
Our noncash non-economic stock comp expense of $20.7 million in the quarter, down slightly from last year. And for the first 9 months, stock comp expense was $58.6 million, down from $83 million last year. And we expect the full year charge this year will be about $78 million. 
During 2016, we expect our G&A, including stock-based comp to grow at a slower rate than sales before considering the impact of the All Managers' Conference. 
Stock comp for 2016 will depend on the stock price at the time of the grant and the number and the types of equity awards issued. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and we expect our effective full year rate to also be 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014. The tax rate in 2014 benefited from an increase in the estimated -- estimate of useful state tax credits and from the work opportunity and the R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed by Congress for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points. And our estimated tax -- effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to remain at around 38.7%.
During the quarter, we repurchased about $30 million of our stock, or approximately 46,000 shares at an average share price of $670. At the end of the third quarter, we had $155 million remaining on our share buyback program. 
We finished the quarter with $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with no debt on the balance sheet. And we continue to believe that the best use of cash is to invest in opening our high-returning Chipotle restaurants in the U.S., and we'll continue to nurture our growth seeds, including ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale and our international Chipotle restaurants, so they will become a compelling use of capital in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to repurchase shares of our stock opportunistically to enhance shareholder value. 
Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have."

On carnitas, it's hard to tell because we did return to 90, and we finished September like just under 60%. We did hit 90 in the second half of September. It did look like in the markets that did get carnitas back that we did see some improvement during like the second week of October. But October's been so choppy, so far, that it's hard to tell. We did expect that based on when we suspended the sale of carnitas, we did see what we thought could be as much as a 200 basis point negative impact on the comps, so we're hoping we'll see that return. But it will take a little bit more time for us to fully see that happen. In terms of the wage inflation, a lot of that was proactive. We did have some isolated areas. We had San Francisco. We had parts of D.C., where there were minimum wage increases. And in most markets, we're above minimum wage, so that doesn't have an immediate impact. But just because of general competition for employees, just the expectation that we want to hire top performers, we want to be the employer of choice, we've been very proactive in making sure that not only our starting wages are competitive, but we also took a look at a number of our hourly managers during the summer to make sure that we're paying fair rates to them as well. So that was proactive. In terms of what to expect going forward, Sharon, I think it just depends on what the labor market looks like. I wouldn't expect it would stay at fully 5% year-after-year, so I don't know it would compound all the way to 5%. But I don't know that it's going to drop all the way down to 2%, which is what it had been running for the last, I'd say, 2 or 3 or 4 years."

So I would say that the July moving to September -- or moving to August was more kind of a hangover effect from ""Friend or Faux."" But we're kind of holding at that lower level, that low single-digit level. Some of that also is due to very, very tough comparisons to last year.

And I think that, obviously, coming off -- we're sort of coming off our highest seasonality in terms of the crowds coming through our restaurants.

And then I think sometimes when things aren't moving -- when the growth isn't quite as rapid, people get a little sort of -- a little less excited about pushing on -- pushing throughput and really watching their 4 pillars execution. So I think that it's kind of a long way of saying it's -- I think we've took our eye off the ball a little bit. I think it happens sometimes, especially after a year of sort of blistering comps and sort of 19.8% a year ago during this time. During those times, it's very easy to keep throughput top of mind and have our crews be focused intensely on it. We had contests running, we had people excited about breaking throughput records and just a lot of focus on it. And I think that the focus has waned a little bit, and that is not -- that's not saying we want to see it continue because throughput, even during slower growth times, we have lines, and we have lines that cause some people to want to walk away. And so we are going to work to sort of replenish and reinvigorate our teams to focus on throughput and on execution of the 4 pillars of throughput because it is still an enormously huge competitive advantage for us and a huge part of customer service. So even though it's only a fall-off of one transaction, we do look to gain transactions. And as you've seen from the previous several years, we've gained -- even at our core lunch hour, we have gained transactions almost every quarter. And so we don't like to see it fall off one. But we're glad to have retained the real significant gains we made during 2013 and '14, but we'd like to improve on that still more."

If you go back and look to 2013, we started a new trend where we started in low single-digit comps, and we kind of built our comps for the next several quarters. We had a price increase in 2014. But if you combine the last 3 years, and this is kind of the end of that trend, our 3-year comps are up in the high 27%, 28% range. We now need to start a new trend because we started that momentum. And if you look quarter by quarter-to-quarter, you can see that the momentum builds for several quarters, it levels off. It peaked last year at 19.8%. And then as you're comparing to multiple years of double-digit comps, and none of this is based on gimmicks, on promotions, on discounting or anything like that, it's really just inviting more customers, and they have a great experience, they want to come back. There's an education that Mark and the team have done with things like Scarecrow and things that raise the awareness of where food comes from, why our food is different. And our customers have been able, during this 3-year trend, to connect the dots between why the food they love so much, why it tastes so good, because it comes from these great ingredients, because the food is prepared using classic cooking techniques, there's real cooking going on in our restaurants. And so right now, we're in this challenge where we've got 3 years of growing our sales by 27%, 28% and comparing to that is difficult. And so what we're hoping will happen is we'll be able to ignite another trend, another 3-year trend. When that will happen and what the order of magnitude of that happening is very difficult to predict. But over the last 10, 15 years, Chipotle has seen these kind of waves of comps, and most of it is around creating awareness and appreciation for what we do at Chipotle."

We just got an email from a former colleague of ours within Florida, moved down to Florida, and he says, ""Out of 10 people, as many as 7 or 8 or 9 of them have never been to Chipotle before."" And so there's still this opportunity to educate people, one that we exist, which, that is changing over time because, as we are in more markets, more and more people know about Chipotle, but they don't necessarily know that we're using classic cooking techniques. They don't necessarily know that we do things like source naturally raised meats, and we have a local program during the right season and things like that. And so that's something that we all bump into people all the time that don't fully understand that. So there's still awareness around why Chipotle is different. There are lots of competitors out there and this makes, I think, the messaging more difficult, that our messaging that they're doing something that is more natural or that would imply that there's higher quality there. And so that does make the message more clear. But we believe that the source of where our comp will come from will still come from educating people about Chipotle, increasing the awareness about why we are different from others. And we've had a great experience where people come in and try Chipotle, and they have a great dining experience, they tend to want to come back. And so while yes, it's more challenging; yes, we have higher volumes; yes, there are more competitors out there; generally, our job is, or our challenge is to get more people to understand and come to Chipotle more often."

We'll take the same approach that we took with -- we talked about it on the -- I think it was on the last quarter, and it was in the San Francisco area and then also in the -- I think it was the mid-Atlantic area. We had a couple of markets that had pretty significant increases in minimum wage. Generally, we're not affected by minimum wage, but in some cases, the minimum wages are being increased to $10, $11, $12 per hour, and those will have some impact. We don't automatically increase prices in those markets. What we do is we look at all the cost of doing business in that area. And in the 2 cases that we mentioned last quarter, we increased prices there because not only are wages up, but those areas already have higher costs of doing business, things like higher occupancy costs and local taxes and things like that. And we looked at competition, the competition was pretty aggressive in raising prices. So we'll do the same thing with minimum wage increases on a market-by-market basis. And we'll make the decisions on a market-by-market basis based on the wages, other costs of doing business, what the competitors are doing and what our current margins are.

They're still in the nurturing phase. They're still in the brand-building phase. When we open up a new restaurant, it behaves a lot like Chipotle 12, 15 years ago, when we went into a new market, where it's an unfamiliar brand, it takes a while for customers to figure out what ShopHouse is. Pizzeria Locale, while it's pizza, it's pizza that may be unfamiliar to customers that are used to traditional pizza. And so there's still a brand building and an understanding of what we're doing, very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days. We're seeing encouraging signs, like we're seeing some very strong comps in the markets that we've opened. It's why we've done things like, with ShopHouse, we're going to open a new market in Chicago. And so it gives us now 3 different markets where the brand building and the awareness is being created. With Pizzeria Locale, same thing, we will -- very soon, we're in 2 markets right now, we'll be in a third market. So I think we're planting the right seeds. We're doing it in a number of markets, where more and more customers will be able to visit these restaurants to figure out what's different about ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale. And as we see the awareness build, as we see the comps continue to build, just like we did with Chipotle in the early days, we'll continue to invest in those markets. And I would say this is a very similar reaction to what we're seeing in Europe. We're seeing very attractive sales comps. We're seeing some inconsistency in way the stores open. Some open hot and open up pretty high right away, and some it takes a little time to build. So they're still what we consider to be in the early brand-building stage, but we're seeing some encouraging signs."

I mean, one thing I think is important to understand about our strategy here is that we deliberately spend less on our marketing, so that we can afford these higher-quality ingredients. And that's essentially the main benefit, the main marketing benefit to our customers. And so we find different ways to tell that story, entertaining ways to do it, but we have recently shifted our focus more to telling the basic story about where our ingredients come from and how they're made, and we've significantly increased our focus on digital marketing, which we've found to be very effective. We're going to be using some of our in-store assets to communicate some of these messages like our packaging. And so I think we're doing it. I think what you won't see from us, though, is some people might think ramping up would mean, well, head to television or something like that. The problem with television, beyond the expense, is that it's really, really tailored toward 30-second spots, which really only deliver if you have some sort of a promotional or call-to-action message in them, which is a very slippery slope. So we're going to stay the course on telling this brand story, but we're working on several large initiatives, some of -- similar to the ones you've seen in the past, as well as what I just mentioned, which is an increased focus on digital and in-store communication.

And also, our team has been organized in a new way that's more efficient that's allowed us to work -- for them to work really, really well together. And with their increased confidence, the team is just feeling great, and they're producing really a lot of great sites with really great terms, with great tenant improvement allowances and building these things for less than we did last year, which is superb. But it really isn't any result of our hiring. Our hiring is something we did because we're really trying to become staffed as well as we can in our existing restaurants, to have an adequate complement of people to build it for our future leadership and have a great base and being able to build, when we do build new restaurants."

I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we've continued to grow our business in a competitive environment while maintaini",1190,"Thanks, Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we've continued to grow our business in a competitive environment while maintaining some of the best margins in the industry. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 12% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and the opening of 53 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.59 per share, an increase of 11%.
With year-to-date revenue of $3.5 billion, comp sales growth of 5.5% and earnings per share growth of 26%, we are well on track to deliver another strong year. More than that, I'm proud of the fact that we continue to deliver such strong results by maintaining true to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We're realizing this vision through constant attention to our unique food and people cultures and by innovating to improve upon these key drivers of our business even in the face of challenges. 
During the quarter, we made significant strides to overcome a major obstacle tied to our ability to obtain pork that meets all of our animal welfare standards. Earlier this month, we announced that we have returned carnitas to 90% of our restaurants nationwide. As discussed on the last earnings call, we have begun to source pork from Karro Foods in the U.K. that is raised in a way that meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards. Just like our current protocols, Karro does not use antibiotics non-therapeutically to promote growth in healthy animals. Karro follows European standards that allow antibiotics to be administered under veterinary supervision, when necessary. We have been very happy with the quality of the pork they've been providing and the care and respect with which Karro is treating their animals. Since beginning our relationship with Karro, we have also secured an additional pork supplier, and we expect to have enough pork to return carnitas to all of our restaurants by the end of November. 
We know that many of our customers love our carnitas and were disappointed we had stopped serving it in a number of our restaurants around the country. To all of our customers who have been inconvenienced by our carnitas shortage, I'd like to personally thank you for your patience and your support. We knew this issue would be difficult for our customers and our restaurants, but we also knew that suspending sales of carnitas in some of our restaurants, rather than serving commodity pork was the right thing to do. And we're thrilled to see that so many of our loyal customers agreed with our decision. 
After highlighting this issue, we have begun discussions with a number of additional suppliers across the country that are interested in working with us to improve animal welfare conditions and meet the standards we require for our pork. I'm so excited about this encouraging change, particularly when compared to the reaction we received when starting our Food with Integrity program a little more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was very little pork available that met our requirements. But today, some of the largest agricultural producers are taking a much closer look at the way they raise their animals, and they're starting to see that we have -- what we have always believed that food grown and raised with respect for animals, the environment, farmers and customers simply tastes better. We're excited to be close to returning to carnitas to 100% of our restaurants. And to let our customers know that carnitas is back, we have been promoting its return in our restaurants through social media and with PR, so customers who have been awaiting its return know where it is available.
Of course, changing the way people think about and eat fast food requires more than overcoming supply change challenges. We focus a lot of our marketing effort on educating customers through entertaining and creative approaches, which Mark will talk about a little bit later. And we're delighted that we continue to see evidence of Chipotle's impact on food issues. 
Most recently, the State of California passed SB-27, making it the first state in the country to pass legislation to limit antibiotic use in healthy livestocks and to ban the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth. We began serving meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics in 1999 when we started serving pork from Niman Ranch. Today, we serve more meat from animals raised without antibiotics than any other restaurant company. While we have been encouraged by even small steps made by other restaurant companies to reduce antibiotic use in farming and moves from some of the largest meat producers to embrace antibiotic-free practices or reduced antibiotic protocols, the California bill is an important -- is important, as it is the first to mandate more responsible antibiotic use in livestock. This is an important step forward in the evolution of animal agriculture, and we hope that others will take similar steps in the foreseeable future.
During the quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, a small 5-day-per-week location in the financial district, which is intensely lunch-driven, like our first stores inside The Loop in Chicago. It is off to a solid start and has been breaking peak-hour throughput records in the U.K. Additionally, just last week, we opened our fourth restaurant in Paris, entering a new neighborhood for us. Our growth seeds in Europe continue to build brand recognition and are at the front end of developing a loyal customer base. 
Our growth seeds here in the U.S. continue to show promise, and we have continued to expand ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. ShopHouse recently opened its fourth location in Los Angeles, bringing the total number of ShopHouse restaurants to 11, and we plan to open 2 ShopHouse restaurants in Chicago before year-end. Pizzeria Locale expanded to its second market during the most recent quarter, opening its first restaurant in Kansas City, and we plan to open 2 pizzas -- Pizzerias in Cincinnati in the coming months. Very exciting to apply our strong food culture and our unique and empowering people culture to these growth seeds. We are changing the way people think about and eat fast food, and our commitment to that vision is the best way to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.
Last, we recently hired our first-ever Chief Information Officer. Curt Garner will be joining Chipotle on November 23, and comes from Starbucks, where he held the same position. In his 18 years at Starbucks, Curt helped build the technology infrastructure that began with fewer than 2,000 stores to one that now supports a global business. We believe that Curt's background and expertise will be a great asset to Chipotle as we continue to seek ways to accelerate our use of technology to help strengthen our business. We're very excited for Curt to join us and look forward to the value he will bring to Chipotle.
I'll now turn the call over to Monty."

Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are setting ours",1219,"Thank you, Steve. Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are setting ourselves up to be able to provide a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also maintaining a strong unit economic model. Like our food culture, building the right people culture is an ongoing journey, and is one that requires us to constantly push ourselves to find ways to get better and to raise the bar on the quality of the experience we provide. 
During the quarter, we've hosted -- we hosted our bi-annual field leadership conference to bring together all of our field leaders and support departments to talk about how we can strengthen our culture. It was a wonderful and inspirational 2 days, focused on how our field leaders can make a bigger impact in their restaurants and help our teams on the road to Restaurateur. We discussed the importance of instilling and inspiring vision, creating encouraging circumstances and how to best utilize our diagnosis and planning tool to identify negative themes that are standing in the way of a restaurant achieving Restaurateur status.
Our unique people culture also continues to gain traction within our growth seeds. As Steve mentioned, during the third quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, and I recently visited the fantastic team there and was pleased to be able to sign them off as Restaurateur. Our European operations team, which is led by Jacob Sumner, a team leader and Restaurateur, has been building outstanding teams to ensure that customer experience we are providing in these new markets meets our high standards, and he continues to develop Restaurateur cultures in these restaurants quickly. 
To help us better plan for future growth, we recently hired Jerome Tafani as our Head of European Business Development. Jerome has decades of restaurant industry experience in Europe, and is spearheading our planning process, including navigating the nuances of operating a new restaurant brand across several countries and identifying lower-cost real estate options in markets that are very expensive. As European customers continue to discover and turn into repeat customers at Chipotle, we are excited for the leadership and insight that Jacob and Jerome bring, and we look forward to great things to come from this team.
As of the end of the quarter, we are proud to have a strong roster of nearly 500 Restaurateurs, with an additional 30 restaurants ready to be signed off by an officer. Our past investment and field leadership is beginning to bear fruit, and we are confident those improved restaurant cultures will lead to better service and a more compelling experience for our customers.
Beyond our efforts to strengthen our restaurant leadership, we recently took a very visible step towards bolstering the bench strength in our restaurant as we held our first-ever National Career Day in September. We set ambitious goals to interview more than 30,000 candidates for this, and through the event and surrounding publicity, we ended up hiring 4,977 incremental crew members. Not only are we excited about our new hires, but this event also created a significant opportunity for us to showcase our people culture and the unique career opportunities we provide. 
Although the overall labor market continues to show signs of tightening, we have found that top performers are consistently attracted to the challenging work environment and growth potential offered at Chipotle. One of the leadership roles within our restaurants is the reliance on what we refer to as a takeout specialist, whose job it is to take care of our out-of-store orders, which are a growing part of our business. 
As you may know, virtually every one of our restaurants is equipped with a second make line, which is an abbreviated version of the front line, where we serve our regular customers. Fortunately, those second make lines are gradually getting more use, and we're now averaging nearly $500 in day -- $500 a day in sales per restaurant on the second make line company-wide. In some of our high-volume restaurants, the sales in the second make line are much, much higher, such that is a virtually a second restaurant within the restaurant, which is a phenomenal way for us to leverage our existing kitchens. 
When we receive online, fax or catering orders, the takeout specialist is managing the timing of orders, food production and all other aspects of the guest experience, and preparing the orders to be picked up. Not only is the sales channel exciting, but it offers the additional benefit of improving throughput, as the more people who use the second make line, the better the customer experience is for the rest of our customers who can more quickly receive and enjoy their meal.
During the third quarter, our teams increased throughput during our peak dinner hour by 1 transaction, while nonpeak throughput counts increased by 9 transactions. Unfortunately, we declined by 1 transaction during our peak lunch hour, and our teams will be working on instilling a sense of urgency to continue to improve this important aspect of customer service during the peak lunch hour. 
We know that as our volumes continue to grow, our teams need to continue to achieve incremental throughput gains to improve the overall customer experience. Better throughput is one key driver that helps us improve our unit economic model, and over the years, has contributed to some of our best cash-on-cash returns. 
Another component for terrific return on investment is the great job that our development team has done on identifying locations for new restaurants while maintaining reasonable capital investment costs. We have built a fantastic development program as our real estate, design and construction teams are finding favorable new restaurant sites and negotiating some of our best lease terms. During the quarter, we opened up 53 new restaurants for a total of 150 restaurants through the first 9 months of this year. This is the fastest that we've ever added new stores, and we're not done yet. Our teams have been working diligently, and we're increasing our guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of 215 to 225 new Chipotles.
What's even more encouraging is that we're able to complete these restaurants in what is arguably one of the most competitive real estate markets we've seen in recent years. Our teams have given us feedback that the competition for new site locations remains high, and the demand for talented contractors, subcontractors and crews is intense, as many developers are taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus on identifying an optimal mix of end-cap and in-line restaurants that have actually allowed us to lower our average investment cost. Also, Chipotle remains a preferred tenant for many landlords, and that places us in a strong position to negotiate favorable lease and tenant improvement terms. It also helps us get into properties even where demand is very high. 
As we think about 2016 new unit development, we expect to open new restaurants at an even faster pace, and are currently projecting a range of 220 to 235 new restaurants for next year.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

During the quarter, we continued our efforts to educate consumers about issues in food and our unique food culture through innovative marketing programs. In our promotion we've called ""Friend or Faux,"" we challenged consumers to identify",924,"Thank you, Monty. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to educate consumers about issues in food and our unique food culture through innovative marketing programs. In our promotion we've called ""Friend or Faux,"" we challenged consumers to identify real friendly ingredients that align with our Food with Integrity vision and faux ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives and additives by comparing our food to a representative set of food meals such as burgers, sub sandwiches and pizzas that are often manufactured with highly processed ingredients. People who play the game could win a ""Buy-One-Get-One"" offer at Chipotle simply by comparing what's in our food against what's in traditional fast food. The idea for this promotion will show -- was to show the simplicity of Chipotle's food, all of which is classically prepared from just 68 ingredients across our entire menu compared to typical fast food where a single menu item can have upwards of 100 ingredients, many of which are chemical additives. 
The program launched in July, and consumer participation exceeded our expectations, with more than 750,000 people playing the game within the first 24 hours. In total, the program generated an average of 180,000 page views a day, totaling 7.5 million views over the duration of the program. The campaign message was clear, with a large majority of respondents in the follow-up survey saying that they understood the intent of ""Friend or Faux,"" and that already positive views of Chipotle were strengthened by the program, with 3/4 of respondents saying that it made them more interested in eating at Chipotle. And although sales did increase with these promotions in July, our long-term goal remains to engage our customers and educate them about the quality and simplicity of our foods. 
We also introduced a retro-style video game called Taste Invaders as another entertaining way to point out to customers some of the artificial ingredients found in typical fast food. The game, which is referred to as a galactic battle against artificial ingredients, has been played more than 2 million times and provides another creative path to learn more about Chipotle -- about the food Chipotle serves compared to the vast majority of other chain restaurants. 
We also continued to advertise nationwide throughout the summer months using traditional online, radio and outdoor media. Our goal to educate customers about where our food comes from and the simplicity of our ingredients is also being carried over to our annual food retail promotion and fundraiser this month. Because we've always believed that artificial ingredients simply aren't necessary for delicious, flavorable food, we are asking our customers to add something unnecessary to their costumes October 31 in order to qualify for a $3 Boorito. Boorito has been the favorite promotion for our customers, and we expect will contribute $1 million to benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.
Increasingly, our customers are ordering using their iPhone and Android devices or visiting our website to order online, and we continue to make improvements to enhance and simplify those user experiences. Our mobile and online sales continued to grow for the seventh consecutive quarter, and currently represent more than 5% of topline sales, up more than 40% over last year. As we move forward, further investments in those platforms will be made with an eye toward developing tools and technologies to help our restaurant teams better manage and execute our out-of-store orders. 
Over the next year, we will also continue to improve and simplify our customers' ability to order their meals online. These investments are still at an early stage, but we believe that they will help us increase the quality of the experience for our guests ordering out-of-store and will help us grow this promising piece of our business. 
We've also added a new delivery partnership for customers who prefer that convenience. Ahead of the fall semester at colleges and universities across the country, we entered into a delivery partnership with Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses and that is already well liked and widely used. We are now delivering to 40 major campuses across the country throughout -- through this partnership. Because it's so tailored to students, Tapingo service includes additional conveniences, such as the ability to partner with university payment programs and deliver to dorm rooms and school buildings. Tapingo marks our third delivery partnership and, collectively, these valued delivery partners enable us to offer a delivery service throughout much of the country. 
Customers also continued to discover our catering. As of tomorrow, it'll be 2 years since we rolled out catering options on a national level, which is available everywhere, with the exception of New York City. And while we continue to gain traction in catering, we know there's still work to be done. Part of that work is to test and, ultimately, roll out an online platform that will allow customers to order and pay for their catering in advance and, ultimately, to have those orders delivered. Setting up delivery for catering is not a simple task, however, particularly when you consider that many of our catering orders are intended to serve up to 200 people. That's a lot of food to be delivered hot, fresh and delicious in a way that meets our high standards and reflects positively on our brand. So we're going to need a partner that has the scale, reach and capability to deliver those large orders, and so we'll be carefully pursuing potential partners, and hope to have trials complete in late 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack."

Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparison from 2014.

Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparison from 2014. We continue to grow our comps this quarter by 2.6%, which is on top of last year's comp of 19.8%, our highest as a public company. We're able to continue to grow even as our restaurants are now achieving volumes of more than $2.5 million on average, all of which can only be accomplished by having top-performing crews and management teams in place that are driven to create an exceptional dining experience for our customers. 
Overall sales for the quarter were up 12% to $1.2 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a 2.6% comp. Year-to-date sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014. Our comp increase during in the quarter was driven by a 1.9% increase in customer visits, accelerated from the second quarter. Increasingly, more customers are connecting with our vision and they appreciate the real food made from wholesome, delicious ingredients, using classic cooking techniques, and they appreciate that all of that just tastes better. 
Our sales comps were highest in July, when our ""Friend or Faux"" campaign was in full force, but were lower in August and September. We were happy with the customer response and engagement with ""Friend or Faux"" during July, as our customers who played the game learned about our simple, wholesome ingredients and were treated to a BOGO for playing. 
During the third quarter, we also began implementing a targeted menu price increase on steak and barbacoa due to the sustained beef inflation, and we'll continue to roll this out -- roll this increase out across the remaining markets during the fourth quarter. This price increase is expected to contribute about 130 basis points when fully rolled out. And for the third quarter, this targeted menu price increase contributed about 70 basis points to the comp. 
Traffic during the first few weeks of October so far has been pretty choppy. But overall, they're averaging about the same as what we saw during August and September, so slightly lower than the overall 2.6% comp in Q3. With the recent return of carnitas to 90% in our restaurant and expectation of getting back to 100% soon, we would expect Q4 comps will be similar to what we saw in Q3. 
For the full year, we continue to expect our overall comp will be in the low and mid-single digits, and as we look out to 2016, we expect the comps will remain in the low single digits. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.59, an increase of 11%, and year-to-date earnings per share was $12.92, a 26% increase over 2014. 
With 2,000 restaurants on the horizon and our restaurants currently achieving record volumes, we're very confident about what lies ahead as we continue toward our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food.
Restaurant-level margins in the quarter were 28.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, and higher labor and marketing costs were partially offset by lower food costs. 
Food costs were 33% in the quarter, down 10 basis points sequentially from Q2 and down 130 basis points compared to 2014. The decrease from the prior year was largely driven by lower cost for avocados and dairy, offset by sustained inflation for beef. We saw a minimal inflation for the rest of our food during the quarter, and we expect our food cost to stay in line with recent results through the end of the year. 
Our pricing for avocados has benefited this year as robust supply from Mexico has helped to keep prices down. While dairy prices remained low due to strong production and increased domestic supplies, a strong U.S. dollar has reduced dairy exports. 
For 2016, we expect food cost inflation will be relatively flat, and our food cost could decrease slightly depending on what happens to our beef cost. U.S. herd count for beef and cattle continues to build, and we may see some relief in the cost of naturally raised beef late in 2016. 
Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor costs were up 40 basis points. After our last call in July, we made significant progress in reducing our labor costs inefficiencies and have returned to what we would consider to be normal labor management and scheduling practices. This resulted in Q3 labor being lower than Q2 by 40 basis points. 
Labor de-levered versus last year by 100 basis points as a result of wage inflation, with our hourly wages up nearly 5% over last year, along with the cost of adding enhanced benefits, such as tuition reimbursement, paid sick leave and increased paid vacation for our hourly restaurant employees as we discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Going forward, we expect labor to be slightly higher than Q3 in the fourth quarter during a seasonally lower sales period. 
Occupancy costs were flat in the quarter compared to last year, and not to mention, we're lowering our overall development costs, which will further strengthen our unit economic model. 
Other operating costs were 11.1% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, largely due to the timing of our marketing and promotions this year, including our ""Friend or Faux"" game and the increased spending surrounding summer advertising to keep Chipotle top of mind. 
Marketing was 1.5% of sales in the quarter, up 20 basis points from last year, and is expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter. Promotion costs were 90 basis points during the quarter, up from 50 basis points last year. For 2016, we anticipate marketing expenses remain right around 1.5% to 1.6% of sales. 
G&A expenses were 5.8% during the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year. And remember that 2014 included our biennial All Managers' Conference, which also will occur in 2016. The conference cost around $10 million in 2014, and is expected to cost around $12 million in 2016. Lower stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus costs are also benefiting G&A for the quarter and for the year-to-date. 
Our noncash non-economic stock comp expense of $20.7 million in the quarter, down slightly from last year. And for the first 9 months, stock comp expense was $58.6 million, down from $83 million last year. And we expect the full year charge this year will be about $78 million. 
During 2016, we expect our G&A, including stock-based comp to grow at a slower rate than sales before considering the impact of the All Managers' Conference. 
Stock comp for 2016 will depend on the stock price at the time of the grant and the number and the types of equity awards issued. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and we expect our effective full year rate to also be 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014. The tax rate in 2014 benefited from an increase in the estimated -- estimate of useful state tax credits and from the work opportunity and the R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed by Congress for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points. And our estimated tax -- effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to remain at around 38.7%.
During the quarter, we repurchased about $30 million of our stock, or approximately 46,000 shares at an average share price of $670. At the end of the third quarter, we had $155 million remaining on our share buyback program. 
We finished the quarter with $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with no debt on the balance sheet. And we continue to believe that the best use of cash is to invest in opening our high-returning Chipotle restaurants in the U.S., and we'll continue to nurture our growth seeds, including ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale and our international Chipotle restaurants, so they will become a compelling use of capital in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to repurchase shares of our stock opportunistically to enhance shareholder value. 
Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have."

I know, originally, you thought it was about a 200 basis point penalty. And then separately on labor, I guess on the wage inflation of 5%, can you kind of dimensionalize what you think your underlying wage inflation is? I think you did some sort of step-up or adjustment in your wage schedule, so I'm not sure kind of how much of that was proactive versus reactive and what might be the ongoing run rate for 2016 for your wage inflation."

On carnitas, it's hard to tell because we did return to 90, and we finished September like just under 60%. We did hit 90 in the second half of September. It did look like in the markets that did get carnitas back that we did see some improvement during like the second week of October. But October's been so choppy, so far, that it's hard to tell. We did expect that based on when we suspended the sale of carnitas, we did see what we thought could be as much as a 200 basis point negative impact on the comps, so we're hoping we'll see that return. But it will take a little bit more time for us to fully see that happen. In terms of the wage inflation, a lot of that was proactive. We did have some isolated areas. We had San Francisco. We had parts of D.C., where there were minimum wage increases. And in most markets, we're above minimum wage, so that doesn't have an immediate impact. But just because of general competition for employees, just the expectation that we want to hire top performers, we want to be the employer of choice, we've been very proactive in making sure that not only our starting wages are competitive, but we also took a look at a number of our hourly managers during the summer to make sure that we're paying fair rates to them as well. So that was proactive. In terms of what to expect going forward, Sharon, I think it just depends on what the labor market looks like. I wouldn't expect it would stay at fully 5% year-after-year, so I don't know it would compound all the way to 5%. But I don't know that it's going to drop all the way down to 2%, which is what it had been running for the last, I'd say, 2 or 3 or 4 years."

And I think that, obviously, coming off -- we're sort of coming off our highest seasonality in terms of the crowds coming through our restaurants. And then simultaneously, with a sort of lower transaction comp that we've been experiencing, I think what happens is sometimes our teams get focused on a number of other things, staffing, being ""A Model,"" training new managers, on-boarding new crews. And then I think sometimes when things aren't moving -- when the growth isn't quite as rapid, people get a little sort of -- a little less excited about pushing on -- pushing throughput and really watching their 4 pillars execution. So I think that it's kind of a long way of saying it's -- I think we've took our eye off the ball a little bit. I think it happens sometimes, especially after a year of sort of blistering comps and sort of 19.8% a year ago during this time. During those times, it's very easy to keep throughput top of mind and have our crews be focused intensely on it. We had contests running, we had people excited about breaking throughput records and just a lot of focus on it. And I think that the focus has waned a little bit, and that is not -- that's not saying we want to see it continue because throughput, even during slower growth times, we have lines, and we have lines that cause some people to want to walk away. And so we are going to work to sort of replenish and reinvigorate our teams to focus on throughput and on execution of the 4 pillars of throughput because it is still an enormously huge competitive advantage for us and a huge part of customer service. So even though it's only a fall-off of one transaction, we do look to gain transactions. And as you've seen from the previous several years, we've gained -- even at our core lunch hour, we have gained transactions almost every quarter. And so we don't like to see it fall off one. But we're glad to have retained the real significant gains we made during 2013 and '14, but we'd like to improve on that still more."

If you go back and look to 2013, we started a new trend where we started in low single-digit comps, and we kind of built our comps for the next several quarters. We had a price increase in 2014. But if you combine the last 3 years, and this is kind of the end of that trend, our 3-year comps are up in the high 27%, 28% range. We now need to start a new trend because we started that momentum. And if you look quarter by quarter-to-quarter, you can see that the momentum builds for several quarters, it levels off. It peaked last year at 19.8%. And then as you're comparing to multiple years of double-digit comps, and none of this is based on gimmicks, on promotions, on discounting or anything like that, it's really just inviting more customers, and they have a great experience, they want to come back. There's an education that Mark and the team have done with things like Scarecrow and things that raise the awareness of where food comes from, why our food is different. And our customers have been able, during this 3-year trend, to connect the dots between why the food they love so much, why it tastes so good, because it comes from these great ingredients, because the food is prepared using classic cooking techniques, there's real cooking going on in our restaurants. And so right now, we're in this challenge where we've got 3 years of growing our sales by 27%, 28% and comparing to that is difficult. And so what we're hoping will happen is we'll be able to ignite another trend, another 3-year trend. When that will happen and what the order of magnitude of that happening is very difficult to predict. But over the last 10, 15 years, Chipotle has seen these kind of waves of comps, and most of it is around creating awareness and appreciation for what we do at Chipotle."

They don't know that we're doing real cooking. I mean, this happens to me all the time. We just got an email from a former colleague of ours within Florida, moved down to Florida, and he says, ""Out of 10 people, as many as 7 or 8 or 9 of them have never been to Chipotle before."" And so there's still this opportunity to educate people, one that we exist, which, that is changing over time because, as we are in more markets, more and more people know about Chipotle, but they don't necessarily know that we're using classic cooking techniques. They don't necessarily know that we do things like source naturally raised meats, and we have a local program during the right season and things like that. And so that's something that we all bump into people all the time that don't fully understand that. So there's still awareness around why Chipotle is different. There are lots of competitors out there and this makes, I think, the messaging more difficult, that our messaging that they're doing something that is more natural or that would imply that there's higher quality there. And so that does make the message more clear. But we believe that the source of where our comp will come from will still come from educating people about Chipotle, increasing the awareness about why we are different from others. And we've had a great experience where people come in and try Chipotle, and they have a great dining experience, they tend to want to come back. And so while yes, it's more challenging; yes, we have higher volumes; yes, there are more competitors out there; generally, our job is, or our challenge is to get more people to understand and come to Chipotle more often."

But we do have a number of isolated markets, a number of which are coming up in January. We'll take the same approach that we took with -- we talked about it on the -- I think it was on the last quarter, and it was in the San Francisco area and then also in the -- I think it was the mid-Atlantic area. We had a couple of markets that had pretty significant increases in minimum wage. Generally, we're not affected by minimum wage, but in some cases, the minimum wages are being increased to $10, $11, $12 per hour, and those will have some impact. We don't automatically increase prices in those markets. What we do is we look at all the cost of doing business in that area. And in the 2 cases that we mentioned last quarter, we increased prices there because not only are wages up, but those areas already have higher costs of doing business, things like higher occupancy costs and local taxes and things like that. And we looked at competition, the competition was pretty aggressive in raising prices. So we'll do the same thing with minimum wage increases on a market-by-market basis. And we'll make the decisions on a market-by-market basis based on the wages, other costs of doing business, what the competitors are doing and what our current margins are. We'll consider all those factors."

They're still in the nurturing phase. They're still in the brand-building phase. When we open up a new restaurant, it behaves a lot like Chipotle 12, 15 years ago, when we went into a new market, where it's an unfamiliar brand, it takes a while for customers to figure out what ShopHouse is. Pizzeria Locale, while it's pizza, it's pizza that may be unfamiliar to customers that are used to traditional pizza. And so there's still a brand building and an understanding of what we're doing, very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days. We're seeing encouraging signs, like we're seeing some very strong comps in the markets that we've opened. It's why we've done things like, with ShopHouse, we're going to open a new market in Chicago. And so it gives us now 3 different markets where the brand building and the awareness is being created. With Pizzeria Locale, same thing, we will -- very soon, we're in 2 markets right now, we'll be in a third market. So I think we're planting the right seeds. We're doing it in a number of markets, where more and more customers will be able to visit these restaurants to figure out what's different about ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale. And as we see the awareness build, as we see the comps continue to build, just like we did with Chipotle in the early days, we'll continue to invest in those markets. And I would say this is a very similar reaction to what we're seeing in Europe. We're seeing very attractive sales comps. We're seeing some inconsistency in way the stores open. Some open hot and open up pretty high right away, and some it takes a little time to build. So they're still what we consider to be in the early brand-building stage, but we're seeing some encouraging signs."

I mean, one thing I think is important to understand about our strategy here is that we deliberately spend less on our marketing, so that we can afford these higher-quality ingredients. And that's essentially the main benefit, the main marketing benefit to our customers. And so we find different ways to tell that story, entertaining ways to do it, but we have recently shifted our focus more to telling the basic story about where our ingredients come from and how they're made, and we've significantly increased our focus on digital marketing, which we've found to be very effective. We're going to be using some of our in-store assets to communicate some of these messages like our packaging. And so I think we're doing it. I think what you won't see from us, though, is some people might think ramping up would mean, well, head to television or something like that. The problem with television, beyond the expense, is that it's really, really tailored toward 30-second spots, which really only deliver if you have some sort of a promotional or call-to-action message in them, which is a very slippery slope. So we're going to stay the course on telling this brand story, but we're working on several large initiatives, some of -- similar to the ones you've seen in the past, as well as what I just mentioned, which is an increased focus on digital and in-store communication. So I'd say we are ramping it up in some way, yes."
