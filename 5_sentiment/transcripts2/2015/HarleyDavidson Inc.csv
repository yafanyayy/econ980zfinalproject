And thanks for joining us on the call. John will provide the details on the quarter in the year.

And thanks for joining us on the call. John will provide the details on the quarter in the year. But first, I want to highlight some of our major achievements for 2014 and then briefly touch on some of our future opportunities. Full year diluted EPS grew more than 18%, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit EPS increases. Consolidated revenue topped the $6 billion mark for the first time since 2006. Gross and operating margins were up strongly driven by our focus on operational efficiencies and our commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our business. A big piece of these improved efficiencies came from manufacturing. 2014 marked our second year of flexible surge production. The financial impacts of surge and all the other improvements in manufacturing in recent years have been remarkable. To say nothing of the added flexibility that surge gives us to capitalize on changing market conditions. 
On the product side, our new 2015 motorcycles have been extremely well received. Retail sales of the new project Rushmore motorcycles, including the return of the Road Glide, the introduction of Classic Low and Ultra Limited Low touring bikes, CVO Street Glide and the Freewheeler have been very strong. We also rolled out the Street 750 and 500 last year, designed for a new generation of global riders, and the response has been outstanding. And in the fourth quarter, retail sales of Street drove double-digit gains in Harley-Davidson's small cruisers in the United States. To date, the majority of initial U.S. Street purchases have been new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
In the international markets, Street is selling very well. And in India, the Street 750 was recently named Motorcycle of the year. In 2015, Street will be available nearly all of our markets worldwide. Also, we continue to see extraordinary level of interest in positive feedback for a bike that's not even on the market, Project LiveWire, Harley-Davidson's first electric motor cycle. In 2014, we gave more than 6,800 demo rides in the U.S. with the vast majority of riders saying that it far exceeded their expectations. The demo tour is moving in to Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific in the 2015. In line with our strategic plan increasingly significant role for the company. 
In 2014, international sales of new Harley-Davidson's grew at more than 5%. And accounted for more than 36% of total retail Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales, that's up from 30% in 2008. We said for several years that we expect international sales to grow at a faster rate than domestic sales. And in 2014, that came into play. The Asia-Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions posted their highest new retail motorcycle sales on record for each region. And we're also seeing success as a result of our U.S. outreach strategies. In 2014 for the third straight year, sales of new Harley's to our outreach customers consistent of young adults, women, African-Americans and Hispanics grew at more than twice the rate sales to core customers. From Street to Touring, we're delivering motorcycles that bring these new riders into the Harley-Davidson's family. 
So overall, 2014 was another great year, and we remain focused on managing the business for the long term, building on our strategies and driving continuous improvement. It's been a little over 5 years since we unveiled our strategies to focus solely on Harley-Davidson brand to be customer lead in everything we do, to transform every of our business and ensure we're developing great leaders at every level of the company to drive our performance. 
Looking at what we've achieved since 2009, there's no doubt in my mind, it was the right strategy and I'm extremely proud of everyone of our team and the proof is in the results. But looking ahead, our strategy will continue to focus on maximizing our opportunities in order to increasingly realize our full potential as a growing global company. That includes, what we see as tremendous opportunities in bringing new products to market, further extending our international reach and expanding our opportunities with outreach customers. It also includes further optimizing Harley-Davidson's agility in manufacturing product development and customer retail experience. With ongoing strategic direction, in clear focus, our business objectives remained extremely relevant. First, to outperform the S&P 500 over time, to grow international retail sales at a faster rate than U.S. sales, and within the U.S., to grow sales to outreach customers at a faster rate than sales to our core customers and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenue. 
So to recap, we've seen proof of what can be accomplished through a sound strategy, focus and determination and by working together as one company, one team, moving in one direction. We also know our work is never done when it comes to continuous improvement. And I've every confidence that we'll continue to achieve great things together. 
With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your investment in Harley-Davidson, and I'll turn it over to John for more details on the quarter and the year."

I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million",1918,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.35 per share. Operating income for the motorcycles segment was $35.9 million, 40.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was flat to prior year, the decrease in the motorcycle business operating income was driven by a lower gross margin percent and higher year-over-year SG&A spending. 
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 1.8% year-over-year. Also, during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February and a lower effective tax rate. We will continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now, let's let get closer look at fourth quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 2.8% over last year's increase of 5.7%. This year's Q4 results were driven by strong increases in our international markets, partially offset by decline in the U.S. Fourth quarter worldwide retail sales reflected in outstanding consumer response to our new 2015 model year motorcycles, including Street, we sold very well in the initial rollout markets. 
Retail sales gains from the new model year bikes were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in retail sales of our initial Rushmore models as we left the enthusiastic customer response after the initial launch of Rushmore in 2013. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 2.7% compared to 2013. 2014 retail sales reflected very challenging U.S. weather conditions in the first half of the year and the absence of the popular Road Glide models for much of the year. As we exited the fourth quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. In 2015, we expect continued momentum behind our model year '15 motorcycles, including increased worldwide distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 12. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, which included initial Rushmore launch. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales during the quarter were; first, retail sales of the 7 new model year '15 Rushmore models were very strong. As anticipated, Road Glide sales were very robust and they represented about 14% of the U.S. retail sales in Q4 versus last year when Road Glide only represented about 4% of sales. Second, retail sales of the new Street motorcycle appear to be largely incremental. We're pleased to see that the majority of initial Street purchasers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand. Reinforcing the strategic importance of this new growth opportunity, in fact, on a combined basis, retail sales of our Sportster and Street motorcycles were up double digits in the quarter. And finally, our retail sales of the first Rushmore models, which launched in August of 2013 were down year-over-year as we left the initial enthusiastic customer response to these highly innovative game changing motorcycles. 
Q4 2013 retail sales of non-Road Glide touring models were up in excess of 40%, compared to Q4 2012. That set up a very tough comparison for Q4 2014. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were up 1.3%. As I'd mentioned, full year retail sales benefited from strong sales of Rushmore and Street motorcycles. However, we believed 2014 retail sales were adversely impacted by weather and the absence of Road Glide. Full year market share decreased 1.6 percentage points, largely driven by the absence of Road Glide. We believe our market share was also impacted by increasing discounting by our competitors late in the year. 
Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,900 motorcycles at the end of 2014, compared to 2013, largely due to the initial dealer fill of Street models for retail. We believe year end dealer inventories is in good position going into 2015. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 9.2% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the full year. We're very pleased with our international performance in 2014. In fact, we experienced all-time high retail sales for EMEA, Asia-Pacific and the Latin American regions. In our EMEA region, Q4 retail sales were up 8.7% driven by growth in nearly all countries throughout the region, in particular, we saw strong growth in Southern Europe, Germany, Switzerland and emerging markets in the region. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were up 6.4% and full year market share in Europe was 12.0%, down 0.8 percentage points behind the introduction of several performance oriented models by the competition. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 14.2% for the fourth quarter, retail sales in emerging markets within the region were up significantly driven by India where retail sales more than doubled during the quarter as a result of very robust demand for our new Street motorcycles. In addition, sales continued to be very strong in China and in Japan. Sales growth turned positive following a couple of down quarters, which were driven by the impact an increase in the consumption tax. 
For the full year, retail sales were up 11.8% in our Asia-Pacific region. Latin America region retail sales were up 4.7% in the quarter as a result of strong growth in Mexico with Brazil modestly. For the full year, retail sales in the Latin America region were up 2.1%. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 5.7% in the fourth quarter and down 10.8% for the full year. 
We believe currency driven price increases impacted retail sales throughout the year. We're encouraged by fourth quarter international performance, we remain concerned ongoing economic challenges in several markets. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across the world and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets. Since 2009, we've added 136 new international dealer points to the distribution network. We believe we can continue to realize strong international growth opportunities by prudently expanding our distribution network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street and Rushmore, which appeal to the global customers. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 1.2% compared to last year. Fourth quarter shipments finished within our expected range of 46.500 to 51.500 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.5 percentage points from the prior year as Rushmore models continued to stimulate demand in the market. 
Also, during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and category was up 3.1 percentage points reflecting our first-year Street shipments. For the full year, we shipped 9,900 Street motorcycles worldwide at the high-end of our expected shipment range of 7,000 to 10,000 motorcycles. We expect that the Street and Sportster category mix will be considerably higher in 2015 behind increased Street shipments. 2014 international shipments as a percentage of the total were 35.7%. We're committed to investing in international growth and continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was flat in the fourth quarter with a 1.2% increase in motorcycle shipments. Revenue was primarily impacted by unfavorable currency exchange. For the full year, motorcycles segment revenue was up 5.9% behind a 3.9% increase in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $133 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the US dollar by approximately 9%, compared to Q4 2013. 
For the full year, 2014, average motorcycle revenue per unit increased by $584 from 2013 driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates. Parts and Accessories sales were down 2.2% in the fourth quarter and up 0.2% for the full year. For the full year, P&A retail sales benefited from strong international sales, partially offset by lower accessory sales following the strong launch of project Rushmore accessories in 2013. 
General Merchandise was down 1.1% in the quarter and down 3.7% for the full year, compared to 2013. Both the fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by of our aggressive SKU reduction plan across our apparel offering in an effort to transform the retail customer experience with a more targeted assortment of popular styles. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 30.5%, which was 1.0 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well with volume price mix all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting the foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $4.4 million driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was largely flat the prior year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect mix to adversely impact margin driven by increased shipments of Street motorcycles, which were not in the year-ago shipments. During the first quarter, we will continue to expand Street distribution to most of Western Europe, Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Foreign currency exchange was $22.8 million unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within and on a year-over-year basis. The Yen Brazilian Real and Australian dollar devalued and average of 6% from the beginning to the end of the quarter and were 9% weaker compared to the prior year quarter. This resulted at an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 2.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign denominated assets on the balance sheet. 
Full year gross margin was 36.4%, which was up 1 percentage point from the last year. We're very pleased with our 2014 gross margin growth, and the balance composition of margin growth across volume price, mix and manufacturing productivity. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 3.5% down 2.4 percentage points, compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $35.9 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending. For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 18.0%, up 1.4 percentage points compared to last year. We're very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in 2014. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on the cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now, moving onto Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the fourth quarter, HDFS's operating profit increased $1.1 million or 1.8% compared to last year. The fourth quarter increase was driven by $5.4 million of improved profitability from our non-lending activities. On a full year basis, HDFS posted operating profit of $277.8 million, a decrease of 1.9% compared to 2013. We were very pleased with the performance of Financial Services business. The business remains very profitable with industry-leading returns and a strong portfolio. Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS's operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 4.7% or $22.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.6 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the fourth quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed for motorcycle. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. Our market share increased to 56.8% compared to 54.5% in 2013. Finance receivables outstanding increased 7.4% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. 
In 2014, approximately 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime. Moving on to credit performance on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2014, was 3.61% or 10 basis points lower than year end 2013. This is the lowest year end 30-day delinquency level in at least 13 years. Annual retail credit losses increased by 13 basis points to 1.22% compared to 2013, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charge-offs in prior years and modestly higher credit losses as a result of changing consumer behavior. We're pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2014, as we continue to contribute strong profitability, delivered solid credit performance and maintained strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. as demonstrated by the $100 million dividend, HDFS paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. this month. Now, let me turn back to John."

Now, let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $964.2 million of cash in marketable securities.

You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $964.2 million of cash in marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.22 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 3-year medium-term offering with a coupon rate of 1.55%. Also, this month, we completed a $700 million as asset securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 3.3 million shares of Harley-Davidson's stock for $222.1 million during the quarter. As we've stated returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
Now, I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22. I'd like to highlight 2 items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $1.15 billion in 2014. Operating cash flow was up $169.6 million from last year, primarily driven by lapping of last year's pension contribution of $175 million and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations. And second, the full year tax rate was 34.2% compared to 34.1% in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2014, the full year benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter. 
The summary of full year 2014 is on Slide 23. We had net income of $844.6 million in 2014, which was up 15.1% compared to 2013 and earnings per share was up 18.3%. The motorcycles segment operating income was up 15.2% compared to prior year. The motorcycle segment growth was driven by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. As expected, HDFS income was down slightly during 2014 behind higher credit losses. 
Finally, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of high interest debt last February. 
On Slide 24, you'll see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we expect to ship 282,000 to 287,000 on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4% to 6% from 2014 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson remain strong. We expect shipment growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, great model year 2015 and 2016 motorcycles, full year Road Glide availability, improving availability and expanding distribution for the new Street motorcycles, continuing outreach momentum in the U.S. and international expansion. 
During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 79,000 and 84,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 4% down 2% compared to last year's first quarter shipments. For 2015, we believe operating margin, the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be up modestly impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle placing, incremental margin driven by higher motorcycle production, and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect lower gross margin as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense, and unfavorable mix. 
To the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency held at yesterday's exchange rates throughout 2015, our motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 3.25%. And while we have a significant portion of the year hedged at attractive rates, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate in the lower gross margin. Pension expense will increase in 2015 as a result of a lower discount rate and change in mortality assumptions. 
Finally, we expect the impact of mix to be negative as we continue to increase distribution of Street motorcycles. Looking at SG&A, we expect spending to increase in 2015 as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect to little decline as a percent of revenue as we leverage our current SG&A spending. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015, compared to 2014 as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing completion.

in 2015. So looking back, we're very pleased with our 2014 results and key accomplishments. In 2014, we successfully increased sales, gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in an 18.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. Expanded our flexible manufacturing capability at our U.S. plans, continued to go outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth rate in United States, once 7 new Rushmore in the new Street platform, Project LiveWire our first electric motorcycle, expanded our international dealer network and delivered shareholder value through a dividend increase of 31% and repurchased $604 million in company shares. We're excited about 2015 and we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions."

So we're seeing here is that if the date rates held at yesterday's with the exchange rates finished yesterday and they held throughout the year. That would take our expected revenue for 2015 and reduce it by 3.25 percentage points. So you take motorcycles segment revenue and take it down by 3.25 points. Now with that, we obviously hedges on.

I guess, my question is, seems like Road Glide is going to be a pretty sizable benefit to the shipment guide and it sounds like you're saying Street is going to be pretty as well. I guess, the question is A, can you quantify those benefits through the shipment guide and B, if not, how are you thinking about everything else, your non-Road Glide, non-Street guidance because it seems like for those of us that turnaround numbers that 4% to 6% represents flat or maybe even down shipments of everything else. How should we think about that?"

As we talked in the preamble, we couldn't feel better about the companies or the brands fundamentals from market share industry to outrage to repeat and the new to the brand and so on and so forth. So that will be a big driver. We've got the model year '15 motorcycles which we certainly saw fourth quarter the new ones performed extremely well including Road Glide. I mean, as you mentioned we got full year Road Glide and Street coming back along with international expansion. But we also have some headwinds, when we look at next year, those being one as lapping Rider Academy sell in which was about 2,200 units in United States in the first half of last year. So we got a lap and then secondly, as we talked about in the fourth quarter we had a very significant year-ago enthusiasm for Rushmore as we got some big gains in the first and second quarters, it tend to taper off each of the quarters and then finally, competitive discounting is coming in play a little bit here. But we kicked all of that, we couldn't feel better about our shipment guidance of up 4% to 6%. And we do expect both the new models as well as core bikes to grow during that to deliver to 4% to 6%."

Revenue was hit by $26 million by that year-over-year 9% devaluation. We did pick up some favorability in gross margin. I'm sorry, cost of goods of about $3.5 million. And that was driven by very favorable gains in terms of the hedges that we did have in place for the quarter, a lot of those been put on several quarters before at very attractive rates. However, the balance sheet revaluation was very significant. I don't quantify exactly the number, but it was certainly over $10 million. So that brought the overall impact down and ultimately it hurt operating profits by $23 million, which represented about 1.4 points of gross margin. So ex-currency gross margin was actually pretty strong and certainly would have been up. Overall, revenue in the quarter was hurt by about 2.5%. As we look forward to the first quarter, Tim, we would expect actually more unfavorability than we saw in the fourth quarter. So we expect more than the $23 million that we had in the fourth quarter and we would expect revenues to be down about 3.25% for the first quarter. When you asked about the positions that we have. We don't provide those, because they change on a regular basis and as the year goes on, obviously, the hedged positions change. Suffice to say that, in the guidance -- in the of our credit risk in 2015, all of that is incorporated. So as of today, all of our positions are incorporated and we would expect revenue to be down the 3.25 and half of that falling through to impact gross margin. So that's kind of all in number for you."

Felicia, I'm just we talked about this last couple of quarters. And we haven't seen a dramatic shift in discounting. When we're looking the fourth quarter, we have seen a stepped-up level of discounting. We always see a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter, one is the lower sales month rate, it is less than 16% of our retail sales. But also, there's a lot of positioning by competition and clearing out inventories. So we saw 2/3 of the folks that have been discounting dramatically increased the discounting at year-over-year basis. So some that will keep a close eye on which got to remember that competitors models are little bit different, the majority of the motorcycles that they sell in a given year are old model years and the fourth quarter was no different. 55% to 75% of the models of the competition sold were over a year old, and so just maybe just cleaning out inventories, but that had a big impact on overall market share in the quarter as well. We are discounts anywhere from $300 a bike to $2,000. So just something that for us watch going forward, but we did see an increase in discounting in the fourth quarter. The second quarter -- the second question, Felicia, was the exchange rates. If they move from here, they're not linear right? Because, we got revaluation of assets, on depending on what happens within cores and we've got the fact that we're constantly changing our hedge position as we talked about we put on hedges in a steer step fashion over 4 quarters, we'll continue to do that. So it is not linear. But certainly with that information, provide a good starting point, but then as the year goes on and things change that could change a bit."

It is all incorporated in our operating margin guidance of 18% to 19%. When we look at that currency guidance, we would expect it to be a headwind of about 0.5 to 0.75 of gross margin point. So obviously, X currency gross margin, I'm sorry, operating margin would be a fair amount higher. And again, we couldn't be more excited about what we've done in terms of manufacturing side of the business to deliver those margins and our ability to price in those types of things. So the underlying cost structure and momentum that we've got is fairly significant, we couldn't be more pleased. Certainly currency is pretty big headwind. So the second question is, with regards to I'm assuming retail inventory at the end of the year. So this year, we were up exactly where we thought, and again, I couldn't said couldn't be more proud of the way that the organization responded to the softer, the poor weather in the first half and the ability of our flexible manufacturing system to adjust very quickly. At the end of the year, we ended with inventory -- retail inventories exactly where we expected in the United States. They were up, but almost all driven by Street dealer fell. As we look forward, I'm feeling very good about the inventory position is today, we would expect inventory to rise behind just the higher sales, basically holding our days inventory constant year-over-year. So there would be a modest increase in inventory on a year-over-year basis as we exit 2015 based on our forward look of retail sales."

So that will drive a lot of benefit in terms of overall gross margin percent as well. And then finally, the business model that we put together and the flexible manufacturing that we've got working and the focus of the plants have on continuous improvement, the systems that we put in are all driving fantastic productivity out of the plants and we would expect that to continue into 2015. And again, I can't say enough about how strong it's been. The second question that you asked is, with regards to our international growth. We've talked a lot about international. We have invested, we have expanded the dealer network and we expect that to continue in 2015. But aside from Street, we talked about Street, 3 out of 4 motorcycles in India are Street. In Southern Europe, it sold very well, it's brining a lot of new people into the brand. And we'll clearly expand that in the first quarter here to many more markets around the world. But we can't overlook how well our products are doing internationally. And the other products are up this year and expected to up next year. But in particular, Project Rushmore motorcycles are selling extremely well internationally. For example, in Europe, we're well over 20% growth in our Touring product.

John will provide the details on the quarter and the year. But first, I want to highlight some of our major achievements for 2014, and then briefly touch on some of our future opportunities. Full year d",848,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. John will provide the details on the quarter and the year. But first, I want to highlight some of our major achievements for 2014, and then briefly touch on some of our future opportunities. Full year diluted EPS grew more than 18%, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit EPS increases. Consolidated revenue topped the $6 billion mark for the first time since 2006. Gross and operating margins were up strongly driven by our focus on operational efficiencies and our commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our business. A big piece of these improved efficiencies came from manufacturing. 2014 marked our second year of flexible surge production. The financial impacts of surge and all the other improvements in manufacturing in recent years have been remarkable. To say nothing of the added flexibility that surge gives us to capitalize on changing market conditions. 
On the product side, our new 2015 motorcycles have been extremely well received. Retail sales of the new project Rushmore motorcycles, including the return of the Road Glide, the introduction of Classic Low and Ultra Limited Low touring bikes, CVO Street Glide and the Freewheeler have been very strong. We also rolled out the Street 750 and 500 last year, designed for a new generation of global riders, and the response has been outstanding. And in the fourth quarter, retail sales of Street drove double-digit gains in Harley-Davidson's small cruisers in the United States. To date, the majority of initial U.S. Street purchases have been new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
In the international markets, Street is selling very well. And in India, the Street 750 was recently named Motorcycle of the Year. In 2015, Street will be available in nearly all of our markets worldwide. Also, we continue to see an extraordinary level of interest and positive feedback for a bike that's not even on the market, Project LiveWire, Harley-Davidson's first electric motorcycle. In 2014, we gave more than 6,800 demo rides in the U.S., with the vast majority of riders saying that it far exceeded their expectations. The demo tour is moving into Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific in 2015, in line with our strategic plan [indiscernible] and increasingly significant role for the company. 
In 2014, international sales of new Harley-Davidson's grew at more than 5% and accounted for more than 36% of total retail Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales, that's up from 30% in 2008. We said for several years that we expect international sales to grow at a faster rate than domestic sales. And in 2014, that came into play. The Asia-Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions posted their highest new retail motorcycle sales on record for each region. And we're also seeing success as a result of our U.S. outreach strategies. In 2014, for the third straight year, sales of new Harley's to our outreach customers, consisting of young adults, women, African-Americans and Hispanics, grew at more than twice the rate of sales to core customers. From Street to Touring, we're delivering motorcycles that bring these new riders into the Harley-Davidson family. 
So overall, 2014 was another great year, and we remain focused on managing the business for the long term, building on our strategies and driving continuous improvement. It's been a little over 5 years since we unveiled our strategies to focus solely on the Harley-Davidson brand to be customer-led in everything we do, to transform every facet of our business and ensure we're developing great leaders at every level of the company to drive our performance. 
Looking at what we've achieved since 2009, there's no doubt in my mind, it was the right strategy and I'm extremely proud of everyone of our team, and the proof is in the results. But looking ahead, our strategy will continue to focus on maximizing our opportunities in order to increasingly realize our full potential as a growing global company. That includes, what we see as tremendous opportunities in bringing new wow products to market, further extending our international reach and expanding our opportunities with outreach customers. It also includes further optimizing Harley-Davidson's agility in manufacturing, product development and customer retail experience. With ongoing strategic direction and clear focus, our business objectives remain extremely relevant. First, to outperform the S&P 500 over time; to grow international retail sales at a faster rate than U.S. sales; and within the U.S., to grow sales to outreach customers at a faster rate than sales to our core customers and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenue. 
So to recap, we've seen proof of what can be accomplished through a sound strategy, focus and determination, and by working together as one company, one team, moving in one direction. We also know our work is never done when it comes to continuous improvement. And I have every confidence that we will continue to achieve great things together. 
With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your investment in Harley-Davidson, and I'll turn it over to John for more detail on the quarter and the year."

I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million",1923,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.35 per share. Operating income for the motorcycles segment was $35.9 million, 40.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was flat to prior year, the decrease in the motorcycle business operating income was driven by a lower gross margin percent and higher year-over-year SG&A spending. 
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 1.8% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February and a lower effective tax rate. We will continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now, let's take a closer look at fourth quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 2.8% over last year's increase of 5.7%. This year's Q4 results were driven by strong increases in our international markets, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. Fourth quarter worldwide retail sales reflected in outstanding consumer response to our new 2015 model year motorcycles, including Street, which sold very well in initial rollout markets. 
Retail sales gains from the new model year bikes were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in retail sales of our initial Rushmore models, as we left the enthusiastic customer response after the initial launch of Rushmore in 2013. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 2.7% compared to 2013. 2014 retail sales reflected very challenging U.S. weather conditions in the first half of the year and the absence of the popular Road Glide models for much of the year. As we exited the fourth quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. In 2015, we expect continued momentum behind our model year '15 motorcycles, including increased worldwide distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 12. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, which included initial Rushmore launch. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales during the quarter were; first, retail sales of the 7 new model year '15 Rushmore models were very strong. As anticipated, Road Glide sales were very robust and they represented about 14% of U.S. retail sales in Q4 versus last year when Road Glide only represented about 4% of sales. Second, retail sales of the new Street motorcycle appeared to be largely incremental. We're pleased to see that the majority of initial Street purchasers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand, reinforcing the strategic importance of this new growth opportunity. In fact, on a combined basis, retail sales of our Sportster and Street motorcycles were up double digits in the quarter. And finally, our retail sales of the first Rushmore models, which launched in August of 2013 were down year-over-year as we left the initial enthusiastic customer response to these highly innovative game-changing motorcycles. 
Q4 2013 retail sales of non-Road Glide touring models were up in excess of 40% compared to Q4 2012. That set up a very tough comparison for Q4 2014. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were up 1.3%. As I had mentioned, full year retail sales benefited from strong sales of Rushmore and Street motorcycles. However, we believed 2014 retail sales were adversely impacted by weather and the absence of Road Glide. Full year market share decreased 1.6 percentage points, largely driven by the absence of Road Glide. We believe our market share was also impacted by increasing discounting by our competitors late in the year. 
Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,900 motorcycles at the end of 2014 compared to 2013, largely due to the initial dealer fill of Street models for retail. We believe year end dealer inventories is in a good position going into 2015. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 9.2% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the full year. We're very pleased with our international performance in 2014. In fact, we experienced all-time high retail sales for EMEA, Asia-Pacific and the Latin America regions. In our EMEA region, Q4 retail sales were up 8.7%, driven by growth in nearly all countries throughout the region, in particular, we saw a strong growth in Southern Europe, Germany, Switzerland and emerging markets in the region. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were up 6.4% and full year market share in Europe was 12.0%, down 0.8 percentage points behind the introduction of several performance-oriented models by the competition. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 14.2% for the fourth quarter, retail sales in emerging markets within the region were up significantly, driven by India, where retail sales more than doubled during the quarter as a result of very robust demand for our new Street motorcycles. In addition, sales continued to be very strong in China. And in Japan, sales growth turned positive following a couple of down quarters, which were driven by the impact an increase in the consumption tax. 
For the full year, retail sales were up 11.8% in our Asia-Pacific region. Latin America region retail sales were up 4.7% in the quarter, as a result of strong growth in Mexico, with Brazil up modestly. For the full year, retail sales in the Latin America region were up 2.1%. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 5.7% in the fourth quarter and down 10.8% for the full year. 
We believe, currency-driven price increases impacted retail sales throughout the year. While we're encouraged by fourth quarter international performance, we remain concerned with ongoing economic challenges in several markets. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across the world and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets. Since 2009, we've added 136 new international dealer points to the distribution network. We believe we can continue to realize strong international growth opportunities by prudently expanding our distribution network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street and Rushmore, which appeal to the global customers. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 1.2% compared to last year. Fourth quarter shipments finished within our expected range of 46,500 to 51,500 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.5 percentage points from the prior year, as Rushmore models continued to stimulate demand in the market. 
Also, during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 3.1 percentage points, reflecting our first-year of Street shipments. For the full year, we shipped 9,900 Street motorcycles worldwide at the high-end of our expected shipment range of 7,000 to 10,000 motorcycles. We expect that the Street and Sportster category mix will be considerably higher in 2015 behind increased Street shipments. 2014 international shipments as a percentage of the total were 35.7%. We're committed to investing in international growth and continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was flat in the fourth quarter, with a 1.2% increase in motorcycle shipments. Revenue was primarily impacted by unfavorable currency exchange. For the full year, motorcycles segment revenue was up 5.9% behind a 3.9% increase in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $133 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the US dollar by approximately 9% compared to Q4 2013. 
For the full year, 2014, average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $584 from 2013, driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates. Parts and Accessories sales were down 2.2% in the fourth quarter and up 0.2% for the full year. For the full year, P&A retail sales benefited from strong international sales, partially offset by lower accessory sales, following the strong launch of project Rushmore accessories in 2013. 
General Merchandise was down 1.1% in the quarter and down 3.7% for the full year, compared to 2013. Both the fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by of our aggressive SKU reduction plan across our apparel offering in an effort to transform the retail customer experience, with a more targeted assortment of popular styles. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 30.5%, which was 1.0 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well with volume, price, mix, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $4.4 million, driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had a unfavorable impact on margin, driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was largely flat the prior year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect mix to adversely impact margin, driven by increased shipments of Street motorcycles, which were not in the year-ago shipments. During the first quarter, we will continue to expand Street distribution to most of Western Europe, Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Foreign currency exchange was $22.8 million, unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 6% from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and were 9% weaker compared to the prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 2.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign-denominated assets on the balance sheet. 
Full year gross margin was 36.4%, which was up 1 percentage point from the last year. We're very pleased with our 2014 gross margin growth, and the balance composition of margin growth across volume, price, mix and manufacturing productivity. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 3.5%, down 2.4 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $35.9 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending. For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 18.0%, up 1.4 percentage points compared to last year. We're very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in 2014. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on the cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now, moving onto our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the fourth quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased $1.1 million or 1.8% compared to last year. The fourth quarter increase was driven by $5.4 million of improved profitability from our non-lending activities. On a full year basis, HDFS posted operating profit of $277.8 million, a decrease of 1.9% compared to 2013. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remains very profitable with industry-leading returns and a strong portfolio. 
Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 4.7% or $22.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.6 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the fourth quarter compared to last year, and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. Our market share increased to 56.8% compared to 54.5% in 2013. Finance receivables outstanding increased 7.4% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and subprime segments. 
In 2014, approximately 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime. Moving on to credit performance on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2014, was 3.61% or 10 basis points lower than year end 2013. This is the lowest year end 30-day delinquency level in at least 13 years. Annual retail credit losses increased by 13 basis points to 1.22% compared to 2013, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years and modestly higher credit losses as a result of changing consumer behavior. We're pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2014, as we continue to contribute strong profitability, delivered solid credit performance and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc., as demonstrated by the $100 million dividend, HDFS, paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. this month. 
Now, let me turn it back to John."

Now, let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 21. You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $964.2 million of cash in marketable securities.

You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $964.2 million of cash in marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.22 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We are -- we currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 3-year medium-term note offering with a coupon rate of 1.55%. Also, this month, we completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 3.3 million shares of Harley-Davidson's stock for $222.1 million during the quarter. As we've stated returning value to our shareholders is a top priority, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
Now, I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22. I'd like to highlight 2 items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $1.15 billion in 2014. Operating cash flow was up $169.6 million from last year, primarily driven by lapping of last year's pension contribution of $175 million and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations. And second, the full year tax rate was 34.2% compared to 34.1% in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2014, the full year benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter. 
The summary of full year 2014 is on Slide 23. We had net income of $844.6 million in 2014, which was up 15.1% compared to 2013, and earnings per share was up 18.3%. The motorcycles segment operating income was up 15.2% compared to prior year. The motorcycle segment growth was driven by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. As expected, HDFS income was down slightly during 2014 behind higher credit losses. 
Finally, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of high interest debt last February. 
On Slide 24, you'll see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we expect to ship 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4% to 6% from 2014 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson remain strong. We expect shipment growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, great model year 2015 and 2016 motorcycles, full year Road Glide availability, improving availability and expanding distribution for the new Street motorcycles, continuing outreach momentum in the U.S. and international expansion. 
During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 79,000 and 84,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 4% to down 2% compared to last year's first quarter shipments. For 2015, we believe operating margin, the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be up modestly impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing; incremental margin, driven by higher motorcycle production; and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect lower gross margin as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense, and unfavorable mix. 
To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency held at yesterday's exchange rates throughout 2015, our motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 3.25%. And while we have a significant portion of the year hedged at attractive rates, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin. Pension expense will increase in 2015 as a result of a lower discount rate and change in mortality assumptions. 
Finally, we expect the impact of mix to be negative as we continue to increase distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Looking at SG&A, we expect spending to increase in 2015, as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect it will decline as a percent of revenue, as we leverage our current SG&A spending. 
For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014, as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing completion and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million and $260 million, as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. 
So, looking back, we're very pleased with our 2014 results and key accomplishments. In 2014, we successfully increased sales, gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in an 18.3% increase in diluted earnings per share; expanded our flexible manufacturing capability at our U.S. plants; continued to go outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth rate in United States; launched 7 new Rushmore motorcycles and -- in the new Street platform; revealed Project LiveWire, our first electric motorcycle; expanded our international dealer network; and delivered shareholder value through a dividend increase of 31% and repurchased $604 million in company shares. 
We're excited about 2015 and we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

We've seen tremendous devaluation, starting back in the third quarter devalued 7%, another 6% in the fourth quarter. And if you look from January 1st of this year through January 28th yesterday's rates, there was another 4% devaluation. And that's taking out our basket of currencies, our major 4 currencies, which is the euro, the yen, the Australia dollar and the Brazilian real. And the mix that we have, we're down quite considerably. So what we're seeing here is that if the rates held at yesterday's, where the exchange rates finished yesterday, and they held throughout the year, that would take our expected revenue for 2015 and reduce it by 3.25 percentage points. So you take motorcycles segment revenue and take it down by 3.25 points. Now with that, obviously, we have hedges on during the year and we talked about that. We typically hedge in a stair-step fashion. So we have some hedges on, but those will diminish as the year goes on. And we would expect out of that revenue hit, 3.25% of our motorcycle segment revenue, half of that would fall and be negative impact to gross margin in terms of the dollar -- gross margin dollar impact."

I mean, as you mentioned, we got the full year Road Glide and Street coming back along with international expansion. But we also have some headwinds. When we look at next year, those being one as lapping the rider academy sell in, which was about 2,200 units in the United States in the first half of last year. So we got to lap that. And then secondly, as we had talked about -- in the fourth quarter, we had very significant year ago enthusiasm for Rushmore, as we got some big gains in the lap in the first and second quarters. It tend to taper off each of the quarters and then finally, competitive discounting is coming into play a little bit here.

On the fourth quarter currency, let's just take a run through, we don't break out specifically the revaluation, but I'll give you a sense of magnitude. Revenue was hit by $26 million by that year-over-year 9% devaluation. We did pick up some favorability in gross margin -- I'm sorry, cost of goods sold of about $3.5 million. And that was driven by very favorable gains in terms of the hedges that we did have in place for the quarter, a lot of those being put on several quarters before at very attractive rates. However, the balance sheet revaluation was very significant. I don't quantify exactly the number, but it was certainly over $10 million. So that brought the overall impact down and ultimately it hurt operating profits by $23 million, which represented about 1.4 points of gross margin. So x currency, our gross margin was actually pretty strong, and certainly would have been up. Overall revenue in the quarter was hurt by about 2.5%. As we look forward to the first quarter, Tim, we would expect actually more unfavorability than we saw in the fourth quarter. So we expect more than the $23 million that we had in the fourth quarter, and we would expect revenues to be down about 3.25% for the first quarter. When you -- you asked about the positions that we have. We don't provide those because they change on a regular basis. And as the year goes on, obviously, the hedge positions change. Suffice to say that, in the guidance or in the dimensionalization of our credit risk in 2015, all of that's incorporated.

Felicia, [indiscernible] you, we've talked about this the last couple of quarters. And we haven't seen a dramatic shift in discounting. When we look in the fourth quarter, we have seen a stepped-up level of discounting. Now we always see a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter. One is the lower sales month, right? It's less than 16% of our retail sales. But also, there's a lot of positioning by competition and clearing out inventories. So we saw 2/3 of the folks that were -- that have been discounting, dramatically increased the discounting on a year-over-year basis. So it's something that we'll keep a close eye on. But you got to remember that competitor's models are a little bit different. The majority of motorcycles that they sell in a given year are old model years, and the fourth quarter was no different. 55% to 75% of the models of the competition sold were over a year old. And so, just maybe, just cleaning out inventories, but that had a big impact on overall market share in the quarter as well. We saw discounts anywhere from $300 a bike to $2,000. So it's just something that -- for us watch going forward, but we did see a -- an increase in discounting in the fourth quarter. The second quarter -- the second question, Felicia, was the exchange rates. If they move from here, they're not linear, right? Because we got revaluation of assets depending on what happens within cores, and we've got the fact that we're constantly changing our hedge position as -- we talked about we put on hedges in a stair-step fashion over 4 quarters. We'll continue to do that. So it is not linear. But certainly, with that information, should provide a good starting point. But then as the year goes on and things change, that could change a bit."

And again, we couldn't be more excited about what we've done in terms of the manufacturing side of the business to deliver those margins and our ability to price in those types of things. So the underlying cost structure and momentum that we've got is fairly significant and we couldn't be more pleased. Certainly, currency is throwing us here a pretty big headwind. So the second question is, with regards to -- I'm assuming retail inventory at the end of the year. So this year, we were up at exactly where we thought. And again, I couldn't say we couldn't be more prouder of the way that the organization responded to the soft or the poor weather in the first half and the ability of our flexible manufacturing system to adjust very quickly. At the end of the year, we ended -- with inventory -- retail inventory is exactly where we expected in the United States. They were up, but almost all driven by the Street dealer fell. As we look forward, and I'm feeling very good about where our inventory position is today, we would expect inventory to rise behind just the higher sales, basically holding our days inventory constant year-over-year.

So that will drive a lot of benefit in terms of overall gross margin percent as well. And then finally, the business model that we put together and the flexible manufacturing that we've got working and the focus that the plants have on continuous improvement, the systems that we put in are all driving fantastic productivity out of the plants, and we would expect that to continue into 2015. And again, I can't say enough about how strong that's been. The second question that you asked is, with regards to our international growth. We've talked a lot about international. We have invested. We have expanded the dealer network and we expect that to continue in 2015. But aside from Street, we talked about Street, 3 out of 4 motorcycles in India are Street.

What we're seeing here is certainly unprecedented, want to see the magnitude of change and to see everything moving in the same direction. And obviously, we've given some dimensionalization on the impact on our earnings. So we're certainly concerned and we'll look at all options to deal with it. But let me tell you, Greg, is that we're going to do what's right for this brand in the long-term, and we're going to work through it.

But first, I want to highlight some of our major achievements for 2014, and then briefly touch on some of our future opportunities. Full year diluted EPS grew more than 18%, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit EPS increases. Consolidated revenue topped the $6 billion mark for the first time since 2006. Gross and operating margins were up strongly driven by our focus on operational efficiencies and our commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our business. A big piece of these improved efficiencies came from manufacturing. 2014 marked our second year of flexible surge production. The financial impacts of surge and all the other improvements in manufacturing in recent years have been remarkable. To say nothing of the added flexibility that surge gives us to capitalize on changing market conditions. 
On the product side, our new 2015 motorcycles have been extremely well received. Retail sales of the new project Rushmore motorcycles, including the return of the Road Glide, the introduction of Classic Low and Ultra Limited Low touring bikes, a CVO Street Glide and the Freewheeler have been very strong. We also rolled out the Street 750 and 500 last year, designed for a new generation of global riders, and the response has been outstanding. And in the fourth quarter, retail sales of Street drove double-digit gains in Harley-Davidson's small cruisers in the United States. To date, the majority of initial U.S. Street purchases have been new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
In the international markets, Street is selling very well. And in India, the Street 750 was recently named Motorcycle of the Year. In 2015, Street will be available in nearly all of our markets worldwide. Also, we continue to see an extraordinary level of interest and positive feedback for a bike that's not even on the market, Project LiveWire, Harley-Davidson's first electric motorcycle. In 2014, we gave more than 6,800 demo rides in the U.S., with the vast majority of riders saying that it far exceeded their expectations. The demo tour is moving into Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific in 2015, in line with our strategic plan [indiscernible] and increasingly significant role for the company. 
In 2014, international sales of new Harley-Davidson's grew at more than 5% and accounted for more than 36% of total retail Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales, that's up from 30% in 2008. We've said for several years that we expect international sales to grow at a faster rate than domestic sales. And in 2014, that came into play. The Asia-Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions posted their highest new retail motorcycle sales on record for each region. And we're also seeing success as a result of our U.S. outreach strategies. In 2014, for the third straight year, sales of new Harley's to our outreach customers, consisting of young adults, women, African-Americans and Hispanics, grew at more than twice the rate of sales to core customers. From Street to Touring, we're delivering motorcycles that bring these new riders into the Harley-Davidson family. 
So overall, 2014 was another great year, and we remain focused on managing the business for the long term, building on our strategies and driving continuous improvement. It's been a little over 5 years since we unveiled our strategies to focus solely on the Harley-Davidson brand, to be customer-led in everything we do, to transform every facet of our business and ensure we're developing great leaders at every level of the company to drive our performance. 
Looking at what we've achieved since 2009, there's no doubt in my mind, it was the right strategy and I'm extremely proud of everyone of our team, and the proof is in the results. But looking ahead, our strategy will continue to focus on maximizing our opportunities in order to increasingly realize our full potential as a growing global company. That includes, what we see as tremendous opportunities in bringing new ""Wow!"" products to market, further extending our international reach and expanding our opportunities with outreach customers. It also includes further optimizing Harley-Davidson's agility in manufacturing, product development and customer retail experience. With ongoing strategic direction and clear focus, our business objectives remain extremely relevant. First, to outperform the S&P 500 over time; to grow international retail sales at a faster rate than U.S. sales; and within the U.S., to grow sales to outreach customers at a faster rate than sales to our core customers and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenue. 
So to recap, we've seen proof of what can be accomplished through a sound strategy, focus and determination, and by working together as one company, one team, moving in one direction. We also know our work is never done when it comes to continuous improvement. And I have every confidence that we will continue to achieve great things together. 
With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your investment in Harley-Davidson, and I'll turn it over to John for more detail on the quarter and the year."

I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million",1927,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.35 per share. Operating income for the motorcycles segment was $35.9 million, 40.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was flat to prior year, the decrease in the motorcycle business operating income was driven by a lower gross margin percent and higher year-over-year SG&A spending. 
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 1.8% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February and a lower effective tax rate. We will continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now, let's take a closer look at fourth quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 2.8% over last year's increase of 5.7%. This year's Q4 results were driven by strong increases in our international markets, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. Fourth quarter worldwide retail sales reflected an outstanding consumer response to our new 2015 model year motorcycles, including Street, which sold very well in initial rollout markets. 
Retail sales gains from the new model year bikes were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in retail sales of our initial Rushmore models, as we lapped the enthusiastic customer response after the initial launch of Rushmore in 2013. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 2.7% compared to 2013. 2014 retail sales reflected very challenging U.S. weather conditions in the first half of the year and the absence of the popular Road Glide models for much of the year. As we exited the fourth quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. In 2015, we expect continued momentum behind our model year '15 motorcycles, including increased worldwide distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 12. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, which included initial Rushmore launch. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales during the quarter were; first, retail sales of the 7 new model year '15 Rushmore models were very strong. As anticipated, Road Glide sales were very robust and they represented about 14% of U.S. retail sales in Q4 versus last year when Road Glide only represented about 4% of sales. Second, retail sales of the new Street motorcycle appeared to be largely incremental. We are pleased to see that the majority of initial Street purchasers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand, reinforcing the strategic importance of this new growth opportunity. In fact, on a combined basis, retail sales of our Sportster and Street motorcycles were up double digits in the quarter. And finally, our retail sales of the first Rushmore models, which launched in August of 2013 were down year-over-year as we lapped the initial enthusiastic customer response to these highly innovative game-changing motorcycles. 
Q4 2013 retail sales of non-Road Glide touring models were up in excess of 40% compared to Q4 2012. That set up a very tough comparison for Q4 2014. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were up 1.3%. As I had mentioned, full year retail sales benefited from strong sales of Rushmore and Street motorcycles. However, we believed 2014 retail sales were adversely impacted by weather and the absence of Road Glide. Full year market share decreased 1.6 percentage points, largely driven by the absence of Road Glide. We believe our market share was also impacted by increasing discounting by our competitors late in the year. 
Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,900 motorcycles at the end of 2014 compared to 2013, largely due to the initial dealer fill of Street models for retail. We believe year end dealer inventories is in a good position going into 2015. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 9.2% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the full year. We are very pleased with our international performance in 2014. In fact, we experienced all-time high retail sales for EMEA, Asia-Pacific and the Latin America regions. In our EMEA region, Q4 retail sales were up 8.7%, driven by growth in nearly all countries throughout the region, in particular, we saw strong growth in Southern Europe, Germany, Switzerland and emerging markets in the region. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were up 6.4% and full year market share in Europe was 12.0%, down 0.8 percentage points behind the introduction of several performance-oriented models by the competition. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, retail sales were up 14.2% for the fourth quarter, retail sales in emerging markets within the region were up significantly, driven by India, where retail sales more than doubled during the quarter as a result of very robust demand for our new Street motorcycles. In addition, sales continued to be very strong in China. And in Japan, sales growth turned positive following a couple of down quarters, which were driven by the impact an increase in the consumption tax. 
For the full year, retail sales were up 11.8% in our Asia-Pacific region. Latin America region retail sales were up 4.7% in the quarter, as a result of strong growth in Mexico, with Brazil up modestly. For the full year, retail sales in the Latin America region were up 2.1%. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 5.7% in the fourth quarter and down 10.8% for the full year. 
We believe, currency-driven price increases impacted retail sales throughout the year. While we are encouraged by fourth quarter international performance, we remain concerned with ongoing economic challenges in several markets. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across the world and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets. Since 2009, we've added 136 new international dealer points to the distribution network. We believe we can continue to realize strong international growth opportunities by prudently expanding our distribution network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street and Rushmore, which appeal to the global customers. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 1.2% compared to last year. Fourth quarter shipments finished within our expected range of 46,500 to 51,500 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.5 percentage points from the prior year, as Rushmore models continued to stimulate demand in the market. 
Also, during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 3.1 percentage points, reflecting our first-year of Street shipments. For the full year, we shipped 9,900 Street motorcycles worldwide at the high-end of our expected shipment range of 7,000 to 10,000 motorcycles. We expect that the Street and Sportster category mix will be considerably higher in 2015 behind increased Street shipments. 2014 international shipments as a percentage of the total were 35.7%. We are committed to investing in international growth and continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was flat in the fourth quarter, with a 1.2% increase in motorcycle shipments. Revenue was primarily impacted by unfavorable currency exchange. For the full year, motorcycles segment revenue was up 5.9% behind a 3.9% increase in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $133 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 9% compared to Q4 2013. 
For the full year, 2014, average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $584 from 2013, driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates. Parts and Accessories sales were down 2.2% in the fourth quarter and up 0.2% for the full year. For the full year, P&A retail sales benefited from strong international sales, partially offset by lower accessory sales, following the strong launch of project Rushmore accessories in 2013. 
General Merchandise was down 1.1% in the quarter and down 3.7% for the full year, compared to 2013. Both the fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by of our aggressive SKU reduction plan across our apparel offering in an effort to transform the retail customer experience, with a more targeted assortment of popular styles. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 30.5%, which was 1.0 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well with volume, price, mix, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $4.4 million, driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin, driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was largely flat the prior year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect mix to adversely impact margin, driven by increased shipments of Street motorcycles, which were not in the year-ago shipments. During the first quarter, we will continue to expand Street distribution to most of Western Europe, Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Foreign currency exchange was $22.8 million, unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 6% from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and were 9% weaker compared to the prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 2.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign-denominated assets on the balance sheet. 
Full year gross margin was 36.4%, which was up 1 percentage point from the last year. We are very pleased with our 2014 gross margin growth, and the balance composition of margin growth across volume, price, mix and manufacturing productivity. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 3.5%, down 2.4 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $35.9 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending. For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 18.0%, up 1.4 percentage points compared to last year. We're very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in 2014. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now, moving onto our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the fourth quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased $1.1 million or 1.8% compared to last year. The fourth quarter increase was driven by $5.4 million of improved profitability from our non-lending activities. On a full year basis, HDFS posted operating profit of $277.8 million, a decrease of 1.9% compared to 2013. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remains very profitable with industry-leading returns and a strong portfolio. 
Now, Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 4.7% or $22.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.6 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the fourth quarter compared to last year, and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. Our market share increased to 56.8% compared to 54.5% in 2013. Finance receivables outstanding increased 7.4% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and sub-prime segments. 
In 2014, approximately 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime. Moving on to credit performance on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2014, was 3.61% or 10 basis points lower than year end 2013. This is the lowest year end 30-day delinquency level in at least 13 years. Annual retail credit losses increased by 13 basis points to 1.22% compared to 2013, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years and modestly higher credit losses as a result of changing consumer behavior. We're pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2014, as we continue to contribute strong profitability, delivered solid credit performance and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc., as demonstrated by the $100 million dividend, HDFS, paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. this month. 
Now, let me turn it back to John."

In addition, we had $1.22 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We are -- we currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 3-year medium-term note offering with a coupon rate of 1.55%. Also, this month, we completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 3.3 million shares of Harley-Davidson's stock for $222.1 million during the quarter. As we've stated returning value to our shareholders is a top priority, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
Now, I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22. I'd like to highlight 2 items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $1.15 billion in 2014. Operating cash flow was up $169.6 million from last year, primarily driven by lapping of last year's pension contribution of $175 million and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations. And second, the full year tax rate was 34.2% compared to 34.1% in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2014, the full year benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter. 
The summary of full year 2014 is on Slide 23. We had net income of $844.6 million in 2014, which was up 15.1% compared to 2013, and earnings per share was up 18.3%. The motorcycles segment operating income was up 15.2% compared to prior year. The motorcycle segment growth was driven by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. As expected, HDFS income was down slightly during 2014 behind higher credit losses. 
Finally, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February. 
On Slide 24, you'll see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we expect to ship 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4% to 6% from 2014 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson remain strong. We expect shipment growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, great model year 2015 and 2016 motorcycles, full year Road Glide availability, improving availability and expanding distribution for the new Street motorcycles, continuing outreach momentum in the U.S. and international expansion. 
During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 79,000 and 84,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 4% to down 2% compared to last year's first quarter shipments. For 2015, we believe operating margin, the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be up modestly impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing; incremental margin, driven by higher motorcycle production; and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect lower gross margin as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense, and unfavorable mix. 
To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency held at yesterday's exchange rates throughout 2015, our motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 3.25%. And while we have a significant portion of the year hedged at attractive rates, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin. Pension expense will increase in 2015 as a result of a lower discount rate and change in mortality assumptions. 
Finally, we expect the impact of mix to be negative as we continue to increase distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Looking at SG&A, we expect spending to increase in 2015, as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect it will decline as a percent of revenue, as we leverage our current SG&A spending. 
For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014, as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing completion and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million and $260 million, as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. 
So, looking back, we're very pleased with our 2014 results and key accomplishments. In 2014, we successfully increased sales, gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in an 18.3% increase in diluted earnings per share; expanded our flexible manufacturing capability at our U.S. plants; continued to grow outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth rate in United States; launched 7 new Rushmore motorcycles and -- in the new Street platform; revealed Project LiveWire, our first electric motorcycle; expanded our international dealer network; and delivered shareholder value through a dividend increase of 31% and repurchased $604 million in company shares. 
We are excited about 2015 and we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. 
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now, let's take your questions."

And that's taking out our basket of currencies, our major 4 currencies, which is the euro, the yen, the Australia dollar and the Brazilian real. And the mix that we have, we're down quite considerably. So what we're saying here is that if the rates held at yesterday's, where the exchange rates finished yesterday, and they held throughout the year, that would take our expected revenue for 2015 and reduce it by 3.25 percentage points. So you take motorcycles segment revenue and take it down by 3.25 points. Now with that, obviously, we have hedges on during the year and we talked about that. We typically hedge in a stair-step fashion. So we have some hedges on, but those will diminish as the year goes on. And we would expect out of that revenue hit, 3.25% of our motorcycle segment revenue, half of that would fall and be negative impact to gross margin in terms of the dollar -- gross margin dollar impact."

Because it seems like, for those of us that are trying to run the numbers, that 4% to 6% represents flat to maybe even down shipments of everything else. How should we think about that?"

And as we talked about in the preamble, we couldn't feel better about the company's or the brand's fundamentals; from market share, to industry, to outreach, to repeat and the new-to-brand and so on and so forth. So that will be a big driver. We've got the model year '15 motorcycles, which we certainly saw in the fourth quarter. The new ones performed extremely well, including Road Glide. I mean, as you mentioned, we got the full year Road Glide and Street coming back along with international expansion. But we also have some headwinds. When we look at next year, those being one is lapping the rider academy sell-in, which was about 2,200 units in the United States in the first half of last year. So we got to lap that. And then secondly, as we had talked about -- in the fourth quarter, we had very significant year ago enthusiasm for Rushmore, and so we got some big gains in the lap in the first and second quarters. They tend to taper off each of the quarters and then finally, competitive discounting is coming into play a little bit here. But we take all of that; we couldn't feel better about our shipment guidance of up 4% to 6%. And we do expect both the new models as well as our core bikes to grow during that to deliver the 4% to 6%."

On the fourth quarter currency, let's just take a run through, we don't break out specifically the revaluation, but I'll give you a sense of magnitude. Revenue was hit by $26 million by that year-over-year 9% devaluation. We did pick up some favorability in gross margin -- I'm sorry, cost of goods sold of about $3.5 million. And that was driven by very favorable gains in terms of the hedges that we did have in place for the quarter, a lot of those being put on several quarters before at very attractive rates. However, the balance sheet revaluation was very significant. I don't quantify exactly the number, but it was certainly over $10 million. So that brought the overall impact down and ultimately it hurt operating profits by $23 million, which represented about 1.4 points of gross margin. So ex currency, our gross margin was actually pretty strong, and certainly would have been up. Overall revenue in the quarter was hurt by about 2.5%. As we look forward to the first quarter, Tim, we would expect, actually, more unfavorability than we saw in the fourth quarter. So we expect more than the $23 million that we had in the fourth quarter, and we would expect revenues to be down about 3.25% for the first quarter. When you -- you asked about the positions that we have. We don't provide those because they change on a regular basis. And as the year goes on, obviously, the hedge positions change.

Felicia, on discounting, we've talked about this the last couple of quarters. And we haven't seen a dramatic shift in discounting. When we look in the fourth quarter, we have seen a stepped-up level of discounting. Now we always see a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter. One, it's the lower sales month, right? It's less than 16% of our retail sales. But also, there's a lot of positioning by competition in clearing out inventories. So we saw 2/3 of the folks that were -- that have been discounting, dramatically increased the discounting on a year-over-year basis. So it's something that we'll keep a close eye on. But you got to remember that our competitor's models are a little bit different. The majority of motorcycles that they sell in a given year are old model years, and the fourth quarter was no different. 55% to 75% of the models that the competition sold were over a year old. And so, just maybe, just cleaning out inventories, but that had a big impact on overall market share in the quarter as well. We saw discounts anywhere from $300 a bike to $2,000. So it's just something that -- for us to watch going forward, but we did see a -- an increase in discounting in the fourth quarter. The second quarter -- the second question, Felicia, was the exchange rates: If they move from here they are not linear, right? Because we got revaluation of assets depending on what happens within quarters, and we've got the fact that we're constantly changing our hedge position as -- we talked about we put on hedges in a stair-step fashion over 4 quarters. We'll continue to do that. So it is not linear. But certainly, with that information, should provide a good starting point. But then as the year goes on and things change, that could change a bit."

And again, we couldn't be more excited about what we've done in terms of the manufacturing side of the business to deliver those margins and our ability to price and those types of things. So the underlying cost structure and momentum that we've got is fairly significant and we couldn't be more pleased. Certainly, currency is throwing us here; a pretty big headwind. So the second question is, with regards to -- I'm assuming retail inventory at the end of the year. So this year, we were up at exactly where we thought. And again, I couldn't say we couldn't be more prouder of the way that the organization responded to the soft or the poor weather in the first half and the ability of our flexible manufacturing system to adjust very quickly. At the end of the year, we ended -- with inventory -- retail inventory is exactly where we expected in the United States. They were up, but almost all driven by the Street dealer fill. As we look forward, and I'm feeling very good about where our inventory position is today, we would expect inventory to rise behind just the higher sales, basically holding our days inventory constant year-over-year.

Europe had pretty significant industry growth in motorcycles, but the economy there is something we want to keep a close eye on. And then, Canada, given the exchange rates in the oil. And Canada has been a little bit tough. So when we look at world markets, again, we couldn't be more excited about our international opportunity, but are a little bit cautious on a few markets out there."

Opportunities on operating margin is very simply -- is we're -- we've priced our model year '15 motorcycles and that's going to continue to drive margin opportunity, both in dollars as well as percent. The other is incremental margin coming from increased sales, that 4% to 6% shipment increase. And Jaime, as we've talked about in the past, we've had a core margin of about 36%, but for each incremental bike that we put through the system here, it's an incremental margin of about 47%. So that will drive a lot of benefit in terms of overall gross margin percent as well. And then finally, the business model that we put together and the flexible manufacturing that we've got working and the focus that the plants have on continuous improvement, the systems that we put in are all driving fantastic productivity out of the plants, and we would expect that to continue into 2015. And again, I can't say enough about how strong that's been. The second question that you asked is, with regards to our international growth. We've talked a lot about international. We have invested. We have expanded the dealer network and we expect that to continue in 2015. But aside from Street, and we've talked about Street, 3 out of 4 motorcycles in India are Street. In Southern Europe, it sold very well. It's brining a lot of new people into the brand. And we'll clearly expand that in the first quarter here to many more markets around the world. But we can't overlook how well our other products are doing internationally. In [indiscernible], products are all up this year and expected to up next year. But in particular, Project Rushmore motorcycles are selling extremely well internationally. For example, in Europe, we're well over 20% growth in our Touring product. And that's happening in Asia and in Latin America as well. And -- so we couldn't be more excited about the overall portfolio internationally."

Full year d",850,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. John will provide the details on the quarter and the year. But first, I want to highlight some of our major achievements for 2014, and then briefly touch on some of our future opportunities. Full year diluted EPS grew more than 18%, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit EPS increases. Consolidated revenue topped the $6 billion mark for the first time since 2006. Gross and operating margins were up strongly driven by our focus on operational efficiencies and our commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our business. A big piece of these improved efficiencies came from manufacturing. 2014 marked our second year of flexible surge production. The financial impacts of surge and all the other improvements in manufacturing in recent years have been remarkable. To say nothing of the added flexibility that surge gives us to capitalize on changing market conditions. 
On the product side, our new 2015 motorcycles have been extremely well received. Retail sales of the new project Rushmore motorcycles, including the return of the Road Glide, the introduction of Classic Low and Ultra Limited Low touring bikes, a CVO Street Glide and the Freewheeler have been very strong. We also rolled out the Street 750 and 500 last year, designed for a new generation of global riders, and the response has been outstanding. And in the fourth quarter, retail sales of Street drove double-digit gains in Harley-Davidson's small cruisers in the United States. To date, the majority of initial U.S. Street purchases have been new to the Harley-Davidson brand. 
In the international markets, Street is selling very well. And in India, the Street 750 was recently named Motorcycle of the Year. In 2015, Street will be available in nearly all of our markets worldwide. Also, we continue to see an extraordinary level of interest and positive feedback for a bike that's not even on the market, Project LiveWire, Harley-Davidson's first electric motorcycle. In 2014, we gave more than 6,800 demo rides in the U.S., with the vast majority of riders saying that it far exceeded their expectations. The demo tour is moving into Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific in 2015, in line with our strategic plan [indiscernible] and increasingly significant role for the company. 
In 2014, international sales of new Harley-Davidson's grew at more than 5% and accounted for more than 36% of total retail Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales, that's up from 30% in 2008. We've said for several years that we expect international sales to grow at a faster rate than domestic sales. And in 2014, that came into play. The Asia-Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions posted their highest new retail motorcycle sales on record for each region. And we're also seeing success as a result of our U.S. outreach strategies. In 2014, for the third straight year, sales of new Harley's to our outreach customers, consisting of young adults, women, African-Americans and Hispanics, grew at more than twice the rate of sales to core customers. From Street to Touring, we're delivering motorcycles that bring these new riders into the Harley-Davidson family. 
So overall, 2014 was another great year, and we remain focused on managing the business for the long term, building on our strategies and driving continuous improvement. It's been a little over 5 years since we unveiled our strategies to focus solely on the Harley-Davidson brand, to be customer-led in everything we do, to transform every facet of our business and ensure we're developing great leaders at every level of the company to drive our performance. 
Looking at what we've achieved since 2009, there's no doubt in my mind, it was the right strategy and I'm extremely proud of every one of our team, and the proof is in the results. But looking ahead, our strategy will continue to focus on maximizing our opportunities in order to increasingly realize our full potential as a growing global company. That includes, what we see as tremendous opportunities in bringing new ""Wow!"" products to market, further extending our international reach and expanding our opportunities with outreach customers. It also includes further optimizing Harley-Davidson's agility in manufacturing, product development and customer retail experience. With ongoing strategic direction and clear focus, our business objectives remain extremely relevant. First, to outperform the S&P 500 over time; to grow international retail sales at a faster rate than U.S. sales; and within the U.S., to grow sales to outreach customers at a faster rate than sales to our core customers and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenue. 
So to recap, we've seen proof of what can be accomplished through a sound strategy, focus and determination, and by working together as one company, one team, moving in one direction. We also know our work is never done when it comes to continuous improvement. And I have every confidence that we will continue to achieve great things together. 
With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your investment in Harley-Davidson, and I'll turn it over to John for more detail on the quarter and the year."

I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million",1930,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results starting on Slide 10. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.20 billion, net income in the quarter was $74.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.35 per share. Operating income for the motorcycles segment was $35.9 million, 40.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. Segment revenue was flat to prior year, the decrease in the motorcycle business operating income was driven by a lower gross margin percent and higher year-over-year SG&A spending. 
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 1.8% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February and a lower effective tax rate. We will continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now, let's take a closer look at fourth quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. Q4 worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 2.8% over last year's increase of 5.7%. This year's Q4 results were driven by strong increases in our international markets, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. Fourth quarter worldwide retail sales reflected an outstanding consumer response to our new 2015 model year motorcycles, including Street, which sold very well in initial rollout markets. 
Retail sales gains from the new model year bikes were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in retail sales of our initial Rushmore models, as we lapped the enthusiastic customer response after the initial launch of Rushmore in 2013. For the full year, worldwide retail sales were up 2.7% compared to 2013. 2014 retail sales reflected very challenging U.S. weather conditions in the first half of the year and the absence of the popular Road Glide models for much of the year. As we exited the fourth quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. In 2015, we expect continued momentum behind our model year '15 motorcycles, including increased worldwide distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 12. Retail sales in the U.S. were down 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, which included initial Rushmore launch. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales during the quarter were; first, retail sales of the 7 new model year '15 Rushmore models were very strong. As anticipated, Road Glide sales were very robust and they represented about 14% of U.S. retail sales in Q4 versus last year when Road Glide only represented about 4% of sales. Second, retail sales of the new Street motorcycle appeared to be largely incremental. We are pleased to see that the majority of initial Street purchasers were new to the Harley-Davidson brand, reinforcing the strategic importance of this new growth opportunity. In fact, on a combined basis, retail sales of our Sportster and Street motorcycles were up double digits in the quarter. And finally, our retail sales of the first Rushmore models, which launched in August of 2013, were down year-over-year as we lapped the initial enthusiastic customer response to these highly innovative game-changing motorcycles. 
Q4 2013 retail sales of non-Road Glide touring models were up in excess of 40% compared to Q4 2012. That set up a very tough comparison for Q4 2014. For the full year, U.S. retail sales were up 1.3%. As I had mentioned, full year retail sales benefited from strong sales of Rushmore and Street motorcycles. However, we believed 2014 retail sales were adversely impacted by weather and the absence of Road Glide. Full year market share decreased 1.6 percentage points, largely driven by the absence of Road Glide. We believe our market share was also impacted by increasing discounting by our competitors late in the year. 
Finally, as expected, U.S. dealer retail inventory was up approximately 2,900 motorcycles at the end of 2014 compared to 2013, largely due to the initial dealer fill of Street models for retail. We believe year-end dealer inventories is in a good position going into 2015. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were up 9.2% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the full year. We are very pleased with our international performance in 2014. In fact, we experienced all-time high retail sales for EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Latin America regions. In our EMEA region, Q4 retail sales were up 8.7%, driven by growth in nearly all countries throughout the region, in particular, we saw strong growth in Southern Europe, Germany, Switzerland and emerging markets in the region. For the full year, EMEA retail sales were up 6.4% and full year market share in Europe was 12.0%, down 0.8 percentage points behind the introduction of several performance-oriented models by the competition. 
In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were up 14.2% for the fourth quarter, retail sales in emerging markets within the region were up significantly, driven by India, where retail sales more than doubled during the quarter as a result of very robust demand for our new Street motorcycles. In addition, sales continued to be very strong in China. And in Japan, sales growth turned positive following a couple of down quarters, which were driven by the impact an increase in the consumption tax. 
For the full year, retail sales were up 11.8% in our Asia-Pacific region. Latin America region retail sales were up 4.7% in the quarter, as a result of strong growth in Mexico, with Brazil up modestly. For the full year, retail sales in the Latin America region were up 2.1%. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down 5.7% in the fourth quarter and down 10.8% for the full year. 
We believe, currency driven price increases impacted retail sales throughout the year. While we are encouraged by fourth quarter international performance, we remain concerned with ongoing economic challenges in several markets. We will continue to focus on what we can control, which includes building our brand experience across the world and expanding our distribution network in emerging markets. Since 2009, we've added 136 new international dealer points to the distribution network. We believe we can continue to realize strong international growth opportunities by prudently expanding our distribution network and increasing our brand relevance by delivering new products such as Street and Rushmore, which appeal to the global customers. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were up 1.2% compared to last year. Fourth quarter shipments finished within our expected range of 46,500 to 51,500 motorcycles. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.5 percentage points from the prior year, as Rushmore models continued to stimulate demand in the market. 
Also, during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 3.1 percentage points, reflecting our first-year of Street shipments. For the full year, we shipped 9,900 Street motorcycles worldwide at the high end of our expected shipment range of 7,000 to 10,000 motorcycles. We expect that the Street and Sportster category mix will be considerably higher in 2015 behind increased Street shipments. 2014 international shipments as a percentage of the total were 35.7%. We are committed to investing in international growth and continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the motorcycles and related product segment was flat in the fourth quarter, with a 1.2% increase in motorcycle shipments. Revenue was primarily impacted by unfavorable currency exchange. For the full year, motorcycles segment revenue was up 5.9% behind a 3.9% increase in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $133 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 9% compared to Q4 2013. 
For the full year, 2014, average motorcycle revenue per unit increased $584 from 2013, driven by higher pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates. Parts and Accessories sales were down 2.2% in the fourth quarter and up 0.2% for the full year. For the full year, P&A retail sales benefited from strong international sales, partially offset by lower accessory sales, following the strong launch of project Rushmore accessories in 2013. 
General Merchandise was down 1.1% in the quarter and down 3.7% for the full year, compared to 2013. Both the fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by of our aggressive SKU reduction plan across our apparel offering in an effort to transform the retail customer experience, with a more targeted assortment of popular styles. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 30.5%, which was 1.0 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well with volume, price, mix, all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $4.4 million, driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin, driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was largely flat the prior year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we expect mix to adversely impact margin, driven by increased shipments of Street motorcycles, which were not in the year-ago shipments. During the first quarter, we will continue to expand Street distribution to most of Western Europe, Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Foreign currency exchange was $22.8 million, unfavorable for the fourth quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 6% from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and were 9% weaker compared to the prior year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 2.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign-denominated assets on the balance sheet. 
Full year gross margin was 36.4%, which was up 1 percentage point from the last year. We are very pleased with our 2014 gross margin growth, and the balance composition of margin growth across volume, price, mix and manufacturing productivity. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 3.5%, down 2.4 percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter. As anticipated, operating income of $35.9 million for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending. For the full year, operating margin as a percent of revenue was 18.0%, up 1.4 percentage points compared to last year. We're very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating expenses in 2014. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now moving onto our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. In the fourth quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased $1.1 million or 1.8% compared to last year. The fourth quarter increase was driven by $5.4 million of improved profitability from our non-lending activities. On a full year basis, HDFS posted operating profit of $277.8 million, a decrease of 1.9% compared to 2013. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remains very profitable with industry-leading returns and a strong portfolio. 
Now Larry will provide more detail on HDFS' operations on Slide 19. Larry?"

During the fourth quarter, HDFS retail motorcycle loan originations increased 4.7% or $22.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.6 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the fourth quarter compared to last year, and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. For the full year, HDFS continued to have a strong retail financing market share of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold in the U.S. Our market share increased to 56.8% compared to 54.5% in 2013. Finance receivables outstanding increased 7.4% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in both the prime and sub-prime segments. 
In 2014, approximately 80% of our new retail loan originations were prime. Moving on to credit performance on Slide 20. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2014, was 3.61% or 10 basis points lower than year end 2013. This is the lowest year end 30-day delinquency level in at least 13 years. Annual retail credit losses increased by 13 basis points to 1.22% compared to 2013, primarily driven by lower levels of recoveries from accounts charged off in prior years and modestly higher credit losses as a result of changing consumer behavior. We're pleased with the progress at HDFS in 2014, as we continue to contribute strong profitability, delivered solid credit performance and maintained a strong liquidity position. We remain focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc., as demonstrated by the $100 million dividend, HDFS, paid to Harley-Davidson, Inc. this month. 
Now let me turn it back to John."

You'll see that at the end of the quarter, we had $964.2 million of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.22 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We are -- we currently have and intend to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 3-year medium-term note offering with a coupon rate of 1.55%. Also, this month, we completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 3.3 million shares of Harley-Davidson's stock for $222.1 million during the quarter. As we've stated returning value to our shareholders is a top priority, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 22. I'd like to highlight 2 items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $1.15 billion in 2014. Operating cash flow was up $169.6 million from last year, primarily driven by lapping of last year's pension contribution of $175 million and increased earnings, partially offset by higher wholesale finance originations. And second, the full year tax rate was 34.2% compared to 34.1% in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the R&D tax credit was reinstated for 2014, the full year benefit was recognized entirely in the fourth quarter. 
The summary of full year 2014 is on Slide 23. We had net income of $844.6 million in 2014, which was up 15.1% compared to 2013, and earnings per share was up 18.3%. The motorcycles segment operating income was up 15.2% compared to prior year. The motorcycle segment growth was driven by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. As expected, HDFS income was down slightly during 2014 behind higher credit losses. 
Finally, we had lower year-over-year interest expense behind the retirement of our high interest debt last February. 
On Slide 24, you'll see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we expect to ship 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 4% to 6% from 2014 shipments. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson remain strong. We expect shipment growth will be driven by the strong appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, great model year 2015 and 2016 motorcycles, full year Road Glide availability, improving availability and expanding distribution for the new Street motorcycles, continuing outreach momentum in the U.S. and international expansion. 
During the first quarter, we expect to ship between 79,000 and 84,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 4% to down 2% compared to last year's first quarter shipments. For 2015, we believe operating margin, the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be up modestly impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing; incremental margin, driven by higher motorcycle production; and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect lower gross margin as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense, and unfavorable mix. 
To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency held at yesterday's exchange rates throughout 2015, our motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 3.25%. And while we have a significant portion of the year hedged at attractive rates, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin. Pension expense will increase in 2015 as a result of a lower discount rate and change in mortality assumptions. 
Finally, we expect the impact of mix to be negative as we continue to increase distribution of Street motorcycles. 
Looking at SG&A. We expect spending to increase in 2015, as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, but we expect it will decline as a percent of revenue, as we leverage our current SG&A spending. 
For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014, as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing completion and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million and $260 million, as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. 
So looking back, we're very pleased with our 2014 results and key accomplishments. In 2014, we successfully increased sales, gross margin and operating margin, which resulted in an 18.3% increase in diluted earnings per share; expanded our flexible manufacturing capability at our U.S. plants; continued to grow outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth rate in United States; launched 7 new Rushmore motorcycles and -- in the new Street platform; revealed Project LiveWire, our first electric motorcycle; expanded our international dealer network; and delivered shareholder value through a dividend increase of 31% and repurchased $604 million in company shares. 
We are excited about 2015 and we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. 
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. And now let's take your questions."

And that's taking out our basket of currencies, our major 4 currencies, which is the euro, the yen, the Australia dollar and the Brazilian real. And the mix that we have, we're down quite considerably. So what we're saying here is that if the rates held at yesterday's, where the exchange rates finished yesterday, and they held throughout the year, that would take our expected revenue for 2015 and reduce it by 3.25 percentage points. So you take motorcycles segment revenue and take it down by 3.25 points. Now with that, obviously, we have hedges on during the year and we talked about that. We typically hedge in a stair-step fashion. So we have some hedges on, but those will diminish as the year goes on. And we would expect out of that revenue hit, 3.25% of our motorcycle segment revenue, half of that would fall and be negative impact to gross margin in terms of the dollar -- gross margin dollar impact."

And as we talked about in the preamble, we couldn't feel better about the company's or the brand's fundamentals; from market share, to industry, to outreach, to repeat and the new-to-brand and so on and so forth. So that will be a big driver. We've got the model year '15 motorcycles, which we certainly saw in the fourth quarter. The new ones performed extremely well, including Road Glide. I mean, as you mentioned, we got the full year Road Glide and Street coming back along with international expansion. But we also have some headwinds. When we look at next year, those being one is lapping the rider academy sell-in, which was about 2,200 units in the United States in the first half of last year. So we got to lap that. And then secondly, as we had talked about -- in the fourth quarter, we had very significant year ago enthusiasm for Rushmore, and so we got some big gains in the lap in the first and second quarters. They tend to taper off each of the quarters and then finally, competitive discounting is coming into play a little bit here. But we take all of that; we couldn't feel better about our shipment guidance of up 4% to 6%.

On the fourth quarter currency, let's just take a run through, we don't break out specifically the revaluation, but I'll give you a sense of magnitude. Revenue was hit by $26 million by that year-over-year 9% devaluation. We did pick up some favorability in gross margin -- I'm sorry, cost of goods sold of about $3.5 million. And that was driven by very favorable gains in terms of the hedges that we did have in place for the quarter, a lot of those being put on several quarters before at very attractive rates. However, the balance sheet revaluation was very significant. I don't quantify exactly the number, but it was certainly over $10 million. So that brought the overall impact down and ultimately it hurt operating profits by $23 million, which represented about 1.4 points of gross margin. So x currency, our gross margin was actually pretty strong, and certainly would have been up. Overall revenue in the quarter was hurt by about 2.5%. As we look forward to the first quarter, Tim, we would expect, actually, more unfavorability than we saw in the fourth quarter. So we expect more than the $23 million that we had in the fourth quarter, and we would expect revenues to be down about 3.25% for the first quarter. When you -- you asked about the positions that we have. We don't provide those because they change on a regular basis. And as the year goes on, obviously, the hedge positions change. Suffice it to say that, in the guidance or in the dimensionalization of our credit risk in 2015, all of that's incorporated. So as of today, all of our positions are incorporated and we would expect revenue to be down 3.25%, and half of that falling through to impact gross margin.

Felicia, on discounting, we've talked about this the last couple of quarters. And we haven't seen a dramatic shift in discounting. When we look in the fourth quarter, we have seen a stepped-up level of discounting. Now we always see a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter. One, it's the lower sales month, right? It's less than 16% of our retail sales. But also, there's a lot of positioning by competition in clearing out inventories. So we saw 2/3 of the folks that were -- that have been discounting, dramatically increased the discounting on a year-over-year basis. So it's something that we'll keep a close eye on. But you got to remember that our competitor's models are a little bit different. The majority of motorcycles that they sell in a given year are old model years, and the fourth quarter was no different. 55% to 75% of the models that the competition sold were over a year old. And so, just maybe, just cleaning out inventories, but that had a big impact on overall market share in the quarter as well. We saw discounts anywhere from $300 a bike to $2,000. So it's just something that -- for us to watch going forward, but we did see a -- an increase in discounting in the fourth quarter. The second quarter -- the second question, Felicia, was the exchange rates: If they move from here they are not linear, right? Because we got revaluation of assets depending on what happens within quarters, and we've got the fact that we're constantly changing our hedge position as -- we talked about we put on hedges in a stair-step fashion over 4 quarters. We'll continue to do that. So it is not linear. But certainly, with that information, should provide a good starting point. But then as the year goes on and things change, that could change a bit."

And again, I couldn't say we couldn't be more prouder of the way that the organization responded to the soft or the poor weather in the first half and the ability of our flexible manufacturing system to adjust very quickly. At the end of the year, we ended -- with inventory -- retail inventory is exactly where we expected in the United States. They were up, but almost all driven by the Street dealer fill. As we look forward, and I'm feeling very good about where our inventory position is today, we would expect inventory to rise behind just the higher sales, basically holding our days inventory constant year-over-year. So there would be a modest increase in inventory on a year-over-year basis as we exit 2015 based on our forward look of retail sales."

Opportunities on operating margin is very simply -- is we're -- we've priced our model year '15 motorcycles and that's going to continue to drive margin opportunity, both in dollars as well as percent. The other is incremental margin coming from increased sales, that 4% to 6% shipment increase. And Jaime, as we've talked about in the past, we've had a core margin of about 36%, but for each incremental bike that we put through the system here, it's an incremental margin of about 47%. So that will drive a lot of benefit in terms of overall gross margin percent as well. And then finally, the business model that we put together and the flexible manufacturing that we've got working and the focus that the plants have on continuous improvement, the systems that we put in are all driving fantastic productivity out of the plants, and we would expect that to continue into 2015. And again, I can't say enough about how strong that's been. The second question that you asked is, with regards to our international growth. We've talked a lot about international. We have invested. We have expanded the dealer network and we expect that to continue in 2015. But aside from Street, and we've talked about Street, 3 out of 4 motorcycles in India are Street. In Southern Europe, it sold very well. It's brining a lot of new people into the brand. And we'll clearly expand that in the first quarter here to many more markets around the world. But we can't overlook how well our other products are doing internationally. In [indiscernible], products are all up this year and expected to up next year. But in particular, Project Rushmore motorcycles are selling extremely well internationally. For example, in Europe, we're well over 20% growth in our Touring product.

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Harley-Davidson. As you know, this is my last earnings call before retiring on May 1, so let me just say that it's been a tremendous privilege to work here for the last 6 years with an outstanding team, from our employees, to our dealers and suppliers, and also, to get to know so many of our customers, investors and all of you who cover us. During the last 6 years, our team has made incredible gains in how we bring new products to market, how we produce them and how we provide the best customer experience in the industry. We've significantly grown our global footprint and broadened our U.S. customer base. And while.  First quarter retail results didn't meet our expectations and we are adjusting shipments to manage supply in line with demand and protect our premium brand, the fact remains that Harley-Davidson stands in a position of great strength, thanks to the hard work of our entire team. We continue to improve our financial performance and operations, reflecting the ongoing power of our transformation and how it drives our operating effectiveness. Just to note a key measure of financial performance, the 39.1% gross margin percentage that we reported this morning is the highest in at least the last 15 years. We are the undeniable market leader in the 601cc plus segment of the motorcycle market, with a broad and outstanding line of products and retail motorcycle sales 6x those of the nearest competitor in the U.S. The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength that we've built over many decades. We've got incredible breadth and depth in our retail distribution and a compelling strategy that's focused on growing our reach to new customers in the U.S. growing internationally and continuously improving every aspect of how we operate.  As we noted in today's press release, we now have the break out of Harley-Davidson's market share for 2014 by demographic group. And for the seventh straight year, and we remain the #1 seller of the on road motorcycles in the U.S. to each of the demographic groups that we track both on the 601cc plus segment and across on road motorcycles of all displacements. 
Turning to international markets, while some parts of Europe were affected by currency and soft economic conditions in the first quarter, other parts of the EMEA region did well. For example, it was our best quarter ever in our Central, Eastern and Southeastern European markets as well as South Africa. In Asia Pacific, we had our strongest quarter ever in India and China, as well as exceptional initial demand for the Street 750 in Korea, Vietnam and Thailand. And Street is doing very well in its initial rollout in Australia and New Zealand among others. In Latin America, sales were up double digits in Mexico with about half of the increase coming from the Street 750. Clearly, Street is hitting the mark. 
I also want to touch on some recognition Harley-Davidson has received in recent weeks. We placed in the top 10 in the Forbes ranking of top employers in America based on a national survey of more than 20,000 employees at U.S. companies. And on the brand side, we were named 2015 Motorcycle Brand of the Year in the Equitrend Harris Poll Annual Study of Brands that's based on familiarity, quality and consideration. I mention these as a reflection of the passion and dedication of our workforce, as well as the power of our brand. Our team's many accomplishments during my time here demonstrate the power of our strategy and being customer-led, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone. And I personally believe Harley-Davidson's best days are yet to come.  Harley-Davidson is a remarkable leader in Matt Levatich as its next CEO. Matt has an outstanding track record, he knows this business in and out and has been a driving force behind our strategy with the vision to take Harley-Davidson to great places. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Matt."

Now let's discuss our first quarter financial results starting on Slide 13. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.67 billion. Net income in the quarter was $269.9 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.27. Operating income for the motorcycle segment was $345.5 million slightly lower than last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was down 3.9% behind significantly unfavorable currency exchange and lower year-over-year shipments. Despite the lower revenue, the motorcycle business operating margin was up 0.8 percentage points driven by a higher gross margin percent and flat year-over-year SG&A spending. Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 2.3% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had a lower effective tax rate.  We continue to focus on delivering strong margins, strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a closer look at first quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 14. Q1 was a tough quarter with worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles down 1.3% compared to last year's increase of 5.8%. Retail sales were soft in both the U.S. and several international regions during the quarter. First quarter worldwide retail sales continue to reflect an outstanding consumer response to our new models, including Street, which sold very well in the initial rollout markets and in new markets which were added throughout the quarter. In the U.S., retail sales were impacted by increased competitive price discounting. The year-over-year comparison also reflects lapping the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore models. Internationally, sales were mainly impacted by lapping last year's favorable weather throughout Europe and also lapping the significant pull forward of sales in Japan in advance of the April 2014 consumption tax increase. As we exited the first quarter, we believe our brand and core demand fundamentals remain very strong. However, in the near-term, our U.S. business is under pressure from increased very aggressive competitive discounting enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. Consequently, we believe it is prudent to adjust our shipment plan for the full year. We now expect to ship 276 to 281,000 motorcycles worldwide which represents growth of approximately 2% to 4% versus prior year. Our previous guidance was 282 to 287,000 motorcycles. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to support a healthy retail channel and protect our premium brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand as we have consistently done over the past several years. Going forward, we expect continued success as we execute our long-term growth strategies. We remain very confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead. 
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 15. First quarter retail sales in the U.S. fell sort of our expectations, down 0.7% compared to the prior year. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales growth during the quarter were first, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q1 2014 retail sales of non-Road Glide Touring motorcycles were up a very strong 35% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q1 2015. Second, we experienced adverse weather conditions in certain regions of the U.S. And finally, continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition which increased from Q4 2014 and was up significantly compared to last year's first quarter. Given the level of competitive inventories in the retail channel coupled with foreign exchange that was favorable for our competitors, we expect aggressive discounting from the competition will continue for some time as they work through what we believe to be excessive retail inventory. 
Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success with our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street 750 sales continue to drive our performance in the Small Cruiser segment which grew double digits on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the industry grew 9.0%. We had a very strong market share of 51.3%. We believe, however, our share was down 4.7 points versus prior year. While we anticipated at some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share in Q1 2015 was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of increased price discounting by the competition. This is not the first time we've experienced period of extreme discounting by our competitors and likely won't be the last. However, we will continue to protect our premium brand. We will not take a short-term view of the current competitive situation and compete by discounting. We will continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long term.  We continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and ship to the low end of our guidance. At the end of the first quarter, U.S. retail inventory was up 6,600 units on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to Street dealer fill but also higher than expected due to soft retail sales in the quarter. 
On Slide 16, you will see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.4% in the first quarter as we lap very strong year-ago retail sales growth of 10.9%. In our EMEA region, Q1 retail sales were down 5.6% driven by lapping last year's very favorable weather conditions across Europe, current soft economic conditions in some markets and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we do not sell in local currencies such as in Russia. Europe market share in Q1 was 9.8% down 1.5 percentage points behind the introduction of several low-priced models by the competition. In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were down 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline was entirely driven by the lapping of year ago retail sales growth of 33.1% in Japan as sales were pulled forward in advance of the consumption tax increase in April 2014. Excluding Japan, Q1 retail sales in the Asia Pacific region were up nearly 20%. Emerging markets within the region, especially India and China, continue to post very strong growth.  Latin America region retail sales were up slightly in the quarter as a result of strong growth in Mexico, largely offset by soft retail sales in Brazil. Retail sales in Brazil have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 5.7% in the first quarter as we lapped currency driven pricing actions initiated last year by our distributor. While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize strong international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 17, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 1.4% compared to last year. First quarter shipments finished near the low end of our expected range of 79 to 84,000 motorcycles as we manage supply in line with lower-than-expected retail sales. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.9 percentage points from the prior year as Rushmore models continue to be in high demand. Also during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 2.8 percentage points reflecting our shipments of Street motorcycles in the quarter. Q1 2015 international shipments as a percent of total were 28.8%. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 18, you'll see revenue from the motorcycle and related products segment was down in the first quarter driven by unfavorable currency exchange and a 1.4% decrease in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $405 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 14% compared to Q1 2014. During the quarter, we took an off model year price increase of 1.2% in Europe to help mitigate the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange in that region. Parts and Accessory revenue were down 7.2% in the first quarter primarily driven by unfavorable currency exchange. General merchandise revenue was up 3.6% in the quarter. 
On Slide 19, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.1% which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed very well, with price, mix, raw materials and manufacturing all being favorable during the quarter partially offsetting unfavorable volume and foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $9.1 million, largely driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was also slightly unfavorable to prior year. Foreign currency exchange was $39.5 million unfavorable for the first quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 8% from the beginning to the end of the quarter and were 14% weaker compared to the prior-year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign denominated assets on the balance sheet.  We are very pleased with our Q1 2015 gross margin percent growth. The record Q1 gross margin performance evidences that the underlying margin structure of the company is very strong. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations. 
On Slide 20, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 22.9%, up 0.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. Operating income of $345.5 million was down $2.2 million versus the prior year driven by slightly unfavorable gross margin dollars and relatively flat SG&A spending. We were very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating margin as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more from profitable. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services segment on Slide 21, in the first quarter, HDFS' operating profits increased $1.5 million or 2.3% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were first, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $4.4 million driven by higher receivables partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Second, provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $5.4 million due to higher retail credit losses and an increase on the reserve rate. Finally, HDFS had strong increases in its insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the first quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remain very profitable with industry-leading returns. 
Now let's take a look at HDFS' operations on Slide 22. During the first quarter, HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 3.2% or $19.3 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.3 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the first quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. Finance receivables outstanding increased 6.6% compared to a year ago driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in the prime and subprime segments. In Q1 2015, approximately 80% of our new motorcycle loan originations were prime. 
Moving on to credit performance on Slide 23, the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at March 31 was 2.64% or 2 basis points lower than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continue to perform at record
[Audio Gap]
points to 1.56% compared to last year's first quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime originations in recent years
[Audio Gap]
During the first quarter, HDFS continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, delivered solid credit performance and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 24. You will see at the end of the quarter, we had $1.23 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.88 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have and intend to facilities. During the first quarter, we successfully completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We also completed a $600 million, 5-year medium-term note offering with a coupon of 2.15%. Additionally, in the first quarter, HDFS paid $100 million dividend to HD Inc. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.9 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $182.5 million during the quarter. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 25. I'd like to highlight 2 items. First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $174.7 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was down $28.9 million from last year, driven by higher working capital and higher wholesale finance originations. And second, first quarter tax rate was 34.4% compared to 35.0% in the year-ago period. 
On Slide 26, you will see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we now expect to ship 276 to 281,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 2% to 4% from 2014 shipments but approximately 6,000 fewer motorcycles than prior guidance. We believe it is prudent to adjust our plan at this time given the increased aggressive price discounting that is occurring in the U.S. market. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson motorcycles remains strong despite the aggressive competitive discounting that is occurring. We are committed to protecting our premium brand and will keep our focus on the long-term sustainability of our business. During the second quarter, we expect to ship 83 to 88,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 5% to 10% compared to last year's second quarter shipments. For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we expect gross margin will be flat to up modestly compared to 2014, impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact for motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense and unfavorable mix. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year motorcycle segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%, 1 percentage point worse than we anticipated in our January call as currencies continue to devalue during the quarter. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year.  Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange impact to be considerably worse than the first quarter's $39.5 million reduction. Assuming yesterday's exchange rates hold for the entire quarter, we would expect second quarter revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5%, with approximately 60% of the revenue decline adversely impacting second quarter's gross margin dollars. We believe second quarter gross margin will be down approximately 2.5 percentage points versus last year's gross margin percent driven by unfavorable currency, lower production as we adjust to lower shipment expectations and unfavorable mix during the quarter compared to last year. 
Looking at SG&A, we now expect spending to be flat-to-down into 2015 as we work to mitigate the adverse impact of lower revenues. In addition, we continue to expect that SG&A will decline as a percent of revenue. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million, $260 million as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. 
So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant price discounting in the U.S., we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the quarter. We successfully increased gross and operating margin percent, continue to grow outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth in the U.S., expanded distribution of Street in the many new international markets, expanded our international dealer network and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of 183 million in company shares. For the remainder of 2015, we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson.

And then how do you assess the risk of really not responding versus the peer group.

Now in 2000, by",266,"Okay, so the first question, Sharon, have we seen other times, In particular when you look back over the last 15 years, there's 2 times in which Harley-Davidson lost share, largely due to competitive discounting. That was in 2000 and 2008. Now in 2000, by 2002, market share was back. And we lost about 3 points in both cases, in 2000 and 2008. And in 2008, we lost 3 points of market share, and then in 2009 we gained back 8.5 points. So this has happened before, we expect it to happen again, and the way that we've managed it is the way we've always managed our great premium brand is that we're not going to jump in and respond to price discounting by discounting our great brand. We're managing this for the long-term value of the brand and the company and stock industry profits thought of it by lowering margin and selling non-full margin product is not the way to do it. Again, and history shows that market share will come back in a short period of time. So we're going to continue to manage this thing for the long term and do what's right for the brand overall. In terms of, I think your third question, Sharon, was on Europe, and the price increase took effect about a month ago. It was 1.2%, given the overall devaluation in Europe, which is significantly more than that. We're balancing that with the competitive set there. And we have not seen any -- not long enough to get a read on any impact of the price increase."

I mean, I know you have given a lot of color about the competition and why you're doing it but again, reactive, proactive, that would be helpful. And then also, you did give some color about this and how you're planning on offsetting the pressures of the deleveraging effect of lower unit sales and FX on gross margins. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically about to the efficiencies that you're enjoying there to help offset some of that.

The guidance reduction -- the first question was with regards to the guidance reduction, it is proactive or reactive. We called out in the fourth quarter that we saw the competitive discounting increase quite dramatically in the fourth quarter, and at that time was said 2/3 of our competition had stepped.
[Audio Gap]
Moving to the first quarter, we are seeing a couple of things happen from what we saw in the first quarter. Both the depth and the breadth of the discounting had increased quite significantly from the fourth quarter. We are seeing discounts now up to $3,000 a bike, we're also seeing competition reprice lower MSRPs, some cases up to 25%. And so with that, to answer your question, it is both reactive and proactive. We do expect that this is more of a fundamental change. There's excess inventory in the channel, and there's a newfound money by our competition, which is largely Japanese and European competitors that have seen their economics shift quite dramatically in the last 3 quarters. So we believe that price discounting will continue for a few to several more quarters, and therefore, we're certainly being proactive because we're not going to discount and what we're going to do is take down our volume. We're going to continue to invest in the equity side of the business and build in the brand and the lifestyle aspects of it, but we're not going to participate in discounting. So we're lowering our volumes 6,000 units and going to continue to sell full margin motorcycles as we move into the future. So a little bit reactive on what we lost in the first quarter but much more proactive on what we expect over the next couple of quarters. Thanks for asking that, I don't want it to go unnoticed that we had a record gross margin in the first quarter, 39.1%, which was up 1.4 percentage points, and that's despite a currency headwind amounted to 1.2 points of gross margin. So we couldn't be more pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our margin structure and how things are proceeding. And a lot of that is driven on the manufacturing line item and the plants are running very well, continuous improvement here is an everyday thing and we continue to find ways to take costs out of the business and to drive things forward. We've talked about pricing and our ability to price, and that's driving a lot of the favorability in the quarter as well."

And so in the first quarter, in the quarter where weather was worse on a year-over-year basis, you're right, James, we saw our competition up about 20%. Credible amount of money coming into the category and lowering the average prices of motorcycles. Again, discounts up to $3,000, repricing MSRP, that's the only way it's possible. And yes, we're seeing the share loss come predominantly through price discounters, mainly the Japanese. And again we have experiences in the past, we'll experience it in the future. When you look at what they're doing and kind of get a difference from the fourth quarter to what we're seeing now, is on the fourth quarter, they predominantly were discounting model -- old model year products, so '13, '14 and '12s. Now, we're seeing migration to discounting of more current model year product, again, leading us to believe that this is going to be a few quarters out that it will continue. We are seeing the discounting across everything, and it's not only the categories which we compete in, which are our Touring and Cruiser segments, but also we're seeing it in performance bikes, we're seeing it in dual, and we're seeing it in standard. And so it is a pretty pervasive. When you look at where it is hitting the hardest in terms of Harley-Davidson, that would be in the Large Cruiser segment. And again, to give an example or dimensionalize it, if you look at the Large Cruiser segment when we have our Softails, Dynas, V-Rods competing, the competition grew that segment about 70% in the first quarter. And again that doesn't happen in a mature category without a shock to it, and that is the favorability that they're receiving on foreign exchange being spent in that way."

From what we hear from the dealers though also it would appear that in the custom category and especially the Sportster category, it's a matter of those products being a little longer in the tooth. You guys have done a lot of innovation obviously in the Touring and with the Street, but you can't do everything at once. But it would seem that the Sportster and the Custom are a little long on the tooth. So could the combination of that and the discounting be the root of the issue here?

So the shipment ramp in the second quarter -- so let's kind of run through where we're at. Where shipments were down 1.4% in the first quarter. Our guidance for 83 to 88,000 motorcycles in the second quarter is down 5% to 10%. So if you work that math out, you're down about 3% to 6% in the first half, which has an implied growth in back half of about 16% on average. So we are back loading the second half. The reason being is all of the basically the 6,000 units are coming out, we're taking out in the second quarter, another opportunity to exercise our flexible manufacturing. If you remember a year ago in the second quarter, weather was very difficult and we ended up with higher inventories than we had wanted at the end of the second quarter and we fixed that in the third quarter. And at this point, we will bring inventories down in the second quarter. So taking the $6,000 guidance reduction out in the second quarter and fixing inventories or bringing inventories where they should be at the end of the second quarter requires us to have more shipments in the back half. We feel very comfortable with that split. And again as we've always said and we've certainly demonstrated, we're going to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and make sure that the marketplace is clean as we move forward. The second question that you had, Joe, is with regards to the North and the South and weather and so on and so forth. If you look at the overall weather from the weather services was pretty even on a year 
[Audio Gap]
precipitation. But when you look at it, this winter was harder in the first quarter than last year because of the timing of when the weather hit and certainly that excess of snowfall in the Northeast. We have 7 sales region and of those 7, 3 of them were down considerably that represent about 40% of our volume and the Northeast being down the most which was down double digits. Now in the areas that didn't have the weather issues, sales were very strong and when we feel great about where we're at, that was led by the West which was up double digits and that's the second year in a row that the first quarter was up over double digits in the West. So again it was clearly a weather issue, it was not a product or mix or the inventories that we had in those markets or on even competition. It was clearly the weather."

So the first question was to expound upon a little bit more on the currency in the quarter, so what we had at the top line, our revenue was impacted by $53.8 million, and that was that 14% devaluation which is the average exchange rates between the first quarter of this year versus last year. And so with revenue down $53.8 million, which is equivalent to 3.5%, we did have a pickup in cost of goods sold of $14.3 million and that was a result of the natural hedges that we have. So some of our parts that we make motorcycles in the United States would come from foreign markets, and so there's a natural hedge there. And then also financial hedges that we had. Those 2 gains were largely offset by the revaluation of our assets. So we have to look and we mark our assets from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. There was an 8% devaluation within the quarter and that generated a significant loss on the revaluation of those assets. That's more of a onetime loss and we reverse itself when currencies come back. But that minimized the impact of those hedges. Therefore that drove the $39.5 million hit to gross margin, which equated to 1.2 points of gross margin and about $0.10 of earnings per share. The other question that you would ask is with regards to competitive pricing, yes, we're well aware that Indian is discounting a fair amount as well and most of the conversations that we've had is currency driven discounting. But all of our competitors, most and every competitor is discounting including Indian, and there are probably similar levels to the Japanese in a lot of respects."

Again, as I mentioned, the ongoing continuous improvement, the way we're operating the plants is all going very well. There is a onetime that we're lapping in manufacturing expense, and that's the Street start-up costs. If you would remember a year ago, we had a fair amount of start-up costs with Street. That was about $4.7 million, $5 million. And so we are lapping that so that would provide some of that benefit that we saw in manufacturing. But that's a core level of profitability, we're just lapping that piece of it. The second question that you had is with regards to our full year guidance. In terms of revenue, 4.25%, you had used a number of $240 million. We won't comment on that, but 50% of it will fall down and hit gross margin in an adverse fashion. We'll pick up some of that in SG&A. The question that you asked is with regards to the magnitude of, I guess, the first half of revenue hit and gross margin hit versus the back half and first quarter that we're going to have, if everything again remains constant is the second quarter. And that's because a year ago, our foreign currencies were the strongest in the second quarter and then we saw late in the third quarter that the currency started to devalue. So we'll be lapping that as we get toward the end of the year. So yes, you're right, the biggest magnitude of impact of foreign currency will be in the first half of the year and more specifically in the second quarter."

Been pretty consistent on a year-over-year basis, but dealer inventory -- international is on a different inventory system. Our dealers pull. When they sell one, they pull one. We call it pipeline. So inventory is more company-owned internationally than dealer-owned and we have very little change in dealer inventories from period-to-period just because of the way that we supply our dealer network. And any inventories would be more company-owned inventories as they fluctuate up and down. So inventory's just different than the United States where we push inventory out to the dealers after we manufacture them. Second question is price competition global, no, we're not seeing global price competition. Our competitors are largely Japanese and European. There's certainly realizing strong benefit when they sell in the United States. But otherwise, we're not seeing any huge price competition outside of Brazil in our foreign markets. The final question was is the percent of revenue at HDFS. Should we be concerned with regards to that and the currency impact in HDFS? The answer is no, HDFS is predominantly in the United States and Canada. They do help with arrangements around the world. But the vast majority of revenue is here in North America."

So let me just say that it's been a tremendous privilege to work here for the last 6 years with an outstanding team, from our employees, to our dealers and suppliers, and also, to get to know so many of our customers, investors and all of you who cover us.
During the last 6 years, our team has made incredible gains in how we bring new products to market, how we produce them and how we provide the best-customer experience in the industry. We've significantly grown our global footprint and broadened our U.S. customer base. And while first quarter retail results didn't meet our expectations and we are adjusting shipments to manage supply in line with demand and protect our premium brand, the fact remains that Harley-Davidson stands in a position of great strength, thanks to the hard work of our entire team. We continue to improve our financial performance and operations, reflecting the ongoing power of our transformation and how it drives our operating effectiveness. Just to note a key measure of financial performance, the 39.1% gross margin percentage that we reported this morning is the highest in at least the last 15 years. We are the undeniable market leader in the 601cc-plus segment of the motorcycle market, with a broad and outstanding line of products and retail motorcycle sales 6x those of the nearest competitor in the U.S. The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength that we've built over many decades. We've got incredible breadth and depth in our retail distribution and a compelling strategy that's focused on growing our reach to new customers in the U.S., growing internationally and continuously improving every aspect of how we operate.  As we noted in today's press release, we now have the breakout of Harley-Davidson's market share for 2014 by demographic group. And for the seventh straight year, we remain the #1 seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to each of the demographic groups that we track, both in the 601cc-plus segment and across on-road motorcycles of all displacements. 
Turning to international markets. While some parts of Europe were affected by currency and soft economic conditions in the first quarter, other parts of the EMEA region did well. For example, it was our best quarter ever in our Central, Eastern and Southeastern European markets as well as South Africa. In Asia Pacific, we had our strongest quarter ever in India and China, as well as exceptional initial demand for the Street 750 in Korea, Vietnam and Thailand. And Street is doing very well in its initial rollout in Australia and New Zealand among others. In Latin America, sales were up double digits in Mexico with about half of the increase coming from the Street 750. Clearly, Street is hitting the mark. 
I also want to touch on some recognition Harley-Davidson has received in recent weeks. We're placed in the top 10 in the Forbes ranking of top employers in America based on a national survey of more than 20,000 employees at U.S. companies. And on the brand side, we were named 2015 Motorcycle Brand of the Year in the EquiTrend Harris Poll Annual Study of Brands that's based on familiarity, quality and consideration. I mention these as a reflection of the passion and dedication of our workforce as well as the power of our brand. Our team's many accomplishments during my time here demonstrate the power of our strategy and being customer-led, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone. And I personally believe Harley-Davidson's best days are yet to come.  Harley-Davidson is a remarkable leader in Matt Levatich as its next CEO. Matt has an outstanding track record. He knows this business in and out and has been a driving force behind our strategy with the vision to take Harley-Davidson to great places. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Matt."

I don't want to take too much time because I know there's a lot to get to, and I'll be talking with many of you again in the coming days and weeks. I do want to take this opportunity though to thank Keith for his inspired leadership. Keith has always been too modest to take credit for returning Harley-Davidson to strength, establishing a culture of leadership and charting a clear vision and strategy for the future. But everyone associated with this company will continue to be inspired by his tremendous contributions. And we all have great confidence in the future for our position of strength and industry leadership. In his comments, Keith touched on a few of Harley's many strengths, from our incredibly talented and passionate employees and our powerful, global dealer network to our brand and industry leadership, our manufacturing, product development and retail prowess, our increasingly diverse customer base, and of course, our unrivaled motorcycles.
We've been in the motorcycle business continuously through all the many ups and downs for 112 years. For the last 6, we've built on our strengths and taken our capabilities to a whole new level, with agility to perform in a world and marketplace that is more dynamic and complex than ever. While our business and industry will always have challenges, Harley-Davidson also has incredible opportunities. We have a clear and compelling strategy, and we're running this business for a long-term performance. That means keeping on the throttle to further leverage our strong product development and manufacturing capabilities even as we increasingly focus on maximizing our potential at retail to grow internationally and to further broaden our reach with new customers here in the United States. 
As good as we may be today, we know we can build on our many strengths to be that much better tomorrow. So thank you.

There is not a better person or a more capable leader to take Harley-Davidson into the future, a very exciting future filled with great opportunity. 
Now let's discuss our first quarter financial results starting on Slide 13. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.67 billion. Net income in the quarter was $269.9 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.27. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was $345.5 million, slightly lower than last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was down 3.9% behind significantly unfavorable currency exchange and lower year-over-year shipments. Despite the lower revenue, the Motorcycle business operating margin was up 0.8 percentage points, driven by a  higher-gross-margin percent, and flat year-over-year SG&A spending.
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 2.3% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had a lower effective tax rate.  We continue to focus on delivering strong margins, strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a closer look at first quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 14. Q1 was a tough quarter with worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles down 1.3% compared to last year's increase of 5.8%. Retail sales were soft in both the U.S. and several international regions during the quarter. First quarter worldwide retail sales continued to reflect an outstanding consumer response to our new models including Street, which sold very well in the initial rollout markets and in new markets which were added throughout the quarter. In the U.S., retail sales were impacted by increased competitive price discounting. The year-over-year comparison also reflects lapping the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore models. Internationally, sales were mainly impacted by lapping last year's favorable weather throughout Europe and also lapping the significant pull-forward of sales in Japan in advance of the April 2014 consumption tax increase. As we exited the first quarter, we believe our brand and core-demand fundamentals remain very strong. However, in the near term, our U.S. business is under pressure from increased, very aggressive, competitive discounting enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. Consequently, we believe, it is prudent to adjust our shipment plan for the full year. We now expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles worldwide, which represents growth of approximately 2% to 4% versus prior year. Our previous guidance was 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to support a healthy retail channel and protect our premium brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand, as we have consistently done over the past several years.
Going forward, we expect continued success as we execute our long-term growth strategies. We remain very confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead.
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 15. First quarter retail sales in the U.S. fell sort of our expectations, down 0.7% compared to the prior year. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales growth during the quarter were: First, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q1 2014 retail sales of an on-road Glide Touring motorcycles were up a very strong 35% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q1 2015. Second, we experienced adverse weather conditions in certain regions of the U.S. And finally, continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition, which increased from Q4 2014 and was up significantly compared to last year's first quarter. Given the levels of competitive inventories in the retail channel, coupled with foreign exchange that was favorable for our competitors, we expect aggressive discounting from the competition will continue for some time as they work through what we believe to be excessive retail inventory. 
Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success with our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street 750 sales continued to drive our performance in the Small Cruiser segment, which grew double digits on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the industry grew 9.0%. We had a very strong market share of 51.3%. We believe the -- however, our share was down 4.7 points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share in Q1 2015 was more severely impacted than we expected, as a result of increased price discounting by the competition. This is not the first time we've experienced period of extreme discounting by our competitors and likely won't be the last. However, we will continue to protect our premium brand. We will not take a short-term view of the current competitive situation and compete by discounting. We will continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long term.  We continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and ship to the low end of our guidance. At the end of the first quarter, U.S. retail inventory was up 6,600 units on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to Street dealer fill, but also higher than expected due to soft retail sales in the quarter. 
On Slide 16, you will see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.4% in the first quarter as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales growth of 10.9%. In our EMEA region, Q1 retail sales were down 5.6%, driven by lapping last year's very favorable weather conditions across Europe, current soft economic conditions in some markets and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we do not sell in local currencies such as in Russia. Europe market share in Q1 was 9.8%, down 1.5 percentage points behind the introduction of several low-priced models by the competition.
In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were down 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline was entirely driven by the lapping of year-ago retail sales growth of 33.1% in Japan, as sales were pulled forward in advance of the consumption tax increase in April 2014. Excluding Japan, Q1 retail sales in the Asia Pacific region were up nearly 20%. Emerging markets within the region, especially India and China, continue to post very strong growth. 
Latin America region retail sales were up slightly in the quarter as a result of strong growth in Mexico, largely offset by soft retail sales in Brazil. Retail sales in Brazil have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition.
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 5.7% in the first quarter, as we lapped currency-driven pricing actions initiated last year by our distributor. While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe, we can continue to realize strong international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 17, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 1.4% compared to last year. First quarter shipments finished near the low end of our expected range of 79,000 to 84,000 motorcycles, as we managed supply in line with lower-than-expected retail sales. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.9 percentage points from the prior year as Rushmore models continued to be in high demand. Also during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 2.8 percentage points, reflecting our shipments of Street motorcycles in the quarter. Q1 2015 international shipments, as a percent of total, were 28.8%. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 18, you'll see revenue from the motorcycle and related products segment was down in the first quarter, driven by unfavorable currency exchange, and a 1.4% decrease in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $405 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 14% compared to Q1 2014. During the quarter, we took an off-model year price increase of 1.2% in Europe to help mitigate the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange in that region. Parts and Accessory revenue was down 7.2% in the first quarter, primarily driven by unfavorable currency exchange. General merchandise revenue was up 3.6% in the quarter. 
On Slide 19, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.1% which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed very well, with price, mix, raw materials and manufacturing all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable volume and foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $9.1 million, largely driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was also slightly unfavorable to prior year. Foreign currency exchange was $39.5 million unfavorable for the first quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 8% from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And we're 14% weaker compared to the prior-year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign denominated assets on the balance sheet.  We are very pleased with our Q1 2015 gross margin percent growth. The record Q1 gross margin performance evidences that the underlying margin structure of the company is very strong. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations. 
On Slide 20, operating margin, as a percent of revenue, for the first quarter was 22.9%, up 0.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. Operating income of $345.5 million was down $2.2 million versus the prior year, driven by slightly unfavorable gross margin dollars, and relatively flat SG&A spending. We were very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating margin as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more from profitable. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services Segment on Slide 21. In the first quarter, HDFS's operating profits increased $1.5 million or 2.3% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were: First, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $4.4 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $5.4 million due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in the reserve rate. Finally, HDFS had strong increase in its insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the first quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remain very profitable with industry-leading returns. 
Now let's take a look at HDFS's operations on Slide 22. During the first quarter, HDFS's retail motorcycle loan originations increased 3.2%, or $19.3 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.3 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the first quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle.
Finance receivables outstanding increased 6.6% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in the prime and subprime segments. In Q1 2015, approximately 80% of our new motorcycle loan originations were prime. 
Moving on to credit performance on Slide 23. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at March 31 was 2.64% or 2 basis points lower than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at record points to 1.56% compared to last year's first quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses, in line with increased subprime originations in recent years. 
During the first quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position, delivered solid credit performance and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson Inc. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 24. You will see, at the end of the quarter, we had $1.23 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.88 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have [indiscernible] facilities. During the first quarter, we successfully completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We also completed a $600 million, 5-year medium-term note offering with a coupon of 2.15%. Additionally, in the first quarter, HDFS paid $100 million dividend to HD Inc. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.9 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $182.5 million during the quarter. Returning values to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson Inc. financials on Slide 25. I'd like to highlight 2 items: First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $174.7 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was down $28.9 million from last year, driven by higher working capital and higher wholesale finance originations. And second, first quarter tax rate was 34.4% compared to 35.0% in the year-ago period. 
On Slide 26, you will see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we now expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 2% to 4% from 2014 shipments, but approximately 6,000 fewer motorcycles than prior guidance. We believe it is prudent to adjust our plan at this time given the increased aggressive price discounting that is occurring in the U.S. market. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson motorcycles remains strong, despite the aggressive competitive discounting that is occurring. We are committed to protecting our premium brand and will keep our focus on the long-term sustainability of our business. During the second quarter, we expect to ship 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 5% to 10% compared to last year's second quarter shipments. For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the Motorcycles segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014.
In 2015, we expect gross margin will be flat to up modestly compared to 2014, impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact for motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense and unfavorable mix. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%, 1 percentage point worse than we anticipated on our January call, as currencies continued to devalue during the quarter. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange impact to be considerably worse than the first quarter's $39.5 million reduction. Assuming yesterday's exchange rates hold for the entire quarter, we would expect second quarter revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5%, with approximately 60% of the revenue decline adversely impacting the second quarter's gross margin dollars. We believe second quarter gross margin will be down approximately 2.5 percentage points versus last year's gross margin percent, driven by unfavorable currency, lower production, as we adjust to lower shipment expectations and unfavorable mix during the quarter compared to last year. 
Looking at SG&A, we now expect spending to be flat to down in 2015 as we work to mitigate the adverse impact of lower revenues. In addition, we continue to expect that SG&A will decline as a percent of revenue. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million, $260 million, as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. 
So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant price discounting in the U.S., we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the quarter. We successfully increased gross and operating margin percent, continued to grow outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth in the U.S., expanded distribution of Street in the many new international markets, expanded our international dealer network and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of 183 million in company shares. For the remainder of 2015, we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson.

That was in 2000 and 2008. Now in 20",273,"Okay, the first question, Sharon is, have we seen other times, in particular when you look back over about the last 15 years, there's 2 times in which Harley-Davidson lost share, largely due to competitive discounting. That was in 2000 and 2008. Now in 2000 -- by 2002, market share was back. And we lost about 3 points in both cases, in 2000 and 2008. And in 2008, we lost 3 points of market share, and then in 2009 we gained back 8.5 points. So this has happened before, we expect it to happen again. And the way that we've managed it, is the way we've always managed our great premium brand, is that we're not going to jump in and respond to price discounting by discounting on our -- discounting our great brand. We're managing this for the long-term value of the brand and the company and stock industry profits thought of it by lowering margin and selling nonfull margin product is not the way to do it. Again, and history shows that market share will come back in a short period of time. So we're going to continue to manage this thing for the long term and do what's right for the brand overall. In terms of, I think your third question, Sharon, was on Europe, and on the price increase took effect about a month ago, it was 1.2%, given the overall devaluation in Europe, which is significantly more than that. We're balancing that with the competitive set there. And we have not seen any -- not long enough to get a read on any impact of the price increase."

The guidance reduction -- the first question was with regards to the guidance reduction, is it proactive or reactive? We'd called out in the fourth quarter that we saw the competitive discounting increase quite dramatically in the fourth",428,"Thanks, Felicia. The guidance reduction -- the first question was with regards to the guidance reduction, is it proactive or reactive? We'd called out in the fourth quarter that we saw the competitive discounting increase quite dramatically in the fourth quarter. And at that time, we said 2/3 of our competition had stepped up.
Moving to the first quarter, we are seeing a couple of things happen from what we saw in the first quarter. Both the depth and the breadth of the discounting has increased quite significantly from the fourth quarter. We are seeing discounts now up to $3,000 a bike. We're also seeing a competition reprice with lower MSRPs, some cases up to 25%. And -- so with that, the answer to your question, it is both reactive and proactive. We do expect that this is more of a fundamental change. There is excess inventory in the channel. And there is a newfound money by our competition, which is largely Japanese and European competitors, that have seen their economics shift quite dramatically in the last 3 quarters. So we believe that price discounting will continue for a few to several more quarters. And therefore, we're certainly being proactive, because we're not going to discount and what we're going to do is take down our volume. We're going to continue to invest in the equity side of the business and build in the brand and the lifestyle aspects of it, but we're not going to participate in discounting. So we're lowering our volumes 6,000 units and going to continue to sell full-margin motorcycles, as we move into the future. So a little bit reactive on what we lost in the first quarter, but much more proactive on what we expect over the next couple of quarters. Thanks for asking that. I don't want it to go unnoticed that we had a record gross margin in the first quarter, 39.1% which was up 1.4 percentage points, and that's despite a currency headwind of -- which amounted to 1.2 points of gross margin. So we couldn't be more pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our margin structure and how things are proceeding. And a lot of that is driven in the manufacturing line item. And the plants are running very well. Continuous improvement here is an everyday thing and we continue to find ways to take costs out of the business and to drive things forward. We've talked about our pricing and our ability to price, and that's driving a lot of the favorability in the quarter as well."

That's the only way it's possible. And yes, we're seeing the share loss come predominantly to price discounters, and mainly the Japanese. And again, we have experiences in the past, we'll experience it in the future. When you look at what they're doing and kind of get a difference from the fourth quarter to what we're seeing now, is in the fourth quarter, they predominantly were discounting model -- old-model-year products, so '14, '13 and '12s. Now, we're seeing a migration to discounting of more current-model-year product, again, leading us to believe that this is going to be a few quarters out that it will continue. We are seeing the discounting across everything. And it's not only the categories which we compete in, which are our Touring and Cruiser segments, but also we're seeing it in performance bikes, we're seeing it in dual, and we're seeing it in standard. So it is pretty pervasive. When you look at where it's hitting the hardest in terms of Harley-Davidson, that would be in the Large Cruiser segment. And again, to give an example to dimensionalize it, if you look at the Large Cruiser segment where we have our Softails, Dynas, V-Rods competing, the competition grew that segment about 70% in the first quarter. And again, that doesn't happen in a matured category without a shock to it, and that is the favorability that they're receiving on foreign exchange being spent in that way."

You guys have done a lot of innovation obviously in the Touring and with the Street, but you can't do everything at once. But it would seem that the Sportster and the Custom are a little long in the tooth. So could the combination of that and the discounting be the root of the issue here?

So the shipment ramp in the second quarter, so let's kind of run through where we're at, where shipments were down 1.4% in the first quarter. Our guidance for 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles in the second quarter is down 5% to 10%. So if you work that math out, you're down about 3% to 6% in the first half, which has an implied growth in the back half of about 16% on average. So we are back loading the second half. The reason being is, all of the -- basically the 6,000 units are coming out, we're taking out in the second quarter, another opportunity to exercise our flexible manufacturing. If you remember a year ago in the second quarter, weather was very difficult and we ended up with higher inventories than we had wanted at the end of the second quarter and we fixed that in the third quarter. And at this point, we will bring inventories down in the second quarter. So taking the $6,000 guidance reduction out in the second quarter and fixing inventories or bringing inventories where they should be at the end of the second quarter requires us to have more shipments in the back half. We feel very comfortable with that split. And again, as we've always said and we've certainly demonstrated, we're going to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and make sure that the marketplace is clean as we move forward. The second question that you had, Joe, is with regards to the North and the South and weather and so on and so forth. If you look at the overall weather from the weather services was pretty even on a year around precipitation. But when you look at it, this winter was a harder first quarter than last year because of the timing of when the weather hit and certainly the excess of snowfall in the Northeast. We have 7 sales region and of those 7, 3 of them were down considerably, that represent about 40% of our volume. And the Northeast being down the most, which was down double digits. Now in the areas that didn't have the weather issues, sales were very strong and when we feel great about where we're at, and that was led by the West which was up double digits. And that's the second year in a row that the first quarter was up over double digits in the West. So again, it was clearly a weather issue. It was not a product or mix or the inventories that we had in those markets or on even competition, it was clearly the weather."

So the first question was to expound upon a little bit more on the currency in the quarter. So what we had, at the top line, our revenue was impacted by $53.8 million, and that was that 14% devaluation which is the average exchange rates between the first quarter of this year versus last year. And so with revenue down $53.8 million, which is equivalent to 3.5%, we did have a pickup in cost of goods sold of $14.3 million and that was a result of the natural hedges that we have. So some of our parts that we make motorcycles in the United States would come from foreign markets, and so there's a natural hedge there, and then also financial hedges that we had. Those 2 gains were largely offset by the revaluation of our assets. So we have to look and we mark our assets from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. There was an 8% devaluation within the quarter and that generated a significant loss on the revaluation of those assets. That's more of a onetime loss and we'll reverse itself when currencies come back. But that minimized the impact of those hedges. Therefore that drove the $39.5 million hit to gross margin, which equated to 1.2 points of gross margin and about $0.10 of earnings per share. The other question that you had asked is with regards to competitive pricing, yes, we're well aware that Indian is discounting a fair amount as well. And most of the conversations that we've had has been currency-driven discounting. But all of our competitors are -- most -- every competitor is discounting including Indian. And there are probably similar levels to the Japanese in a lot of respects."

Again, as I  had mentioned, the ongoing continuous improvement, the way we're operating the plants is all going very well.

That was about $4.7 million, $5 million. And so we are lapping that so that would provide some of that benefit that we saw in manufacturing. But that's a core level of profitability. We're just lapping that piece of it. The second question that you had is with regards to our full year guidance. In terms of revenue, 4.25%, you had used a number of $240 million, we won't comment on that. But 50% of it will fall down and hit gross margin in an adverse fashion. We'll pick up some of that in SG&A. The question that you asked is with regards to the magnitude of, I guess, the first half revenue hit and gross margin hit versus the back half. And first quarter that we're going to have, if everything again remains constant, is the second quarter. And that's because a year ago, our foreign currencies were the strongest in the second quarter and then we saw late in the third quarter that the currency started to devalue, so we'll be lapping that as we get towards the end of the year.

But dealer inventory international is on a different inventory system. Our dealers pull. When they sell one, they pull one. We call it pipeline. So inventory is more company-owned internationally than dealer-owned. And we have very little change in dealer inventories from period-to-period just because of the way that we supply our dealer network. And any inventories would be more company-owned inventories as they fluctuate up and down. So inventories are just different than in the United States where we push the inventory out to the dealers after we manufacture them. Second question, is price competition global, no, we're not seeing global price competition. Our competitors are largely Japanese and European. There's certainly realizing a strong benefit when they sell in the United States. But otherwise, we're not seeing any huge price competition outside of Brazil in our foreign markets. The final question was, is the percent of revenue at HDFS, should we be concerned with regards to that and the currency impact on HDFS, the answer is no.

And at this point, the weather we would believe is more timing. The 6,000 units that we took out are driven by the competitive discounting that we're seeing in the United States. International, we feel very good about our business there. And in the United States, we're under pressure from the price discounting, and we're dealing that with that by taking 6,000 out and tightening up our inventories here a little bit.

So let me just say that it's been a tremendous privile",689,"Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Harley-Davidson. As you know, this is my last earnings call before retiring on May 1. So let me just say that it's been a tremendous privilege to work here for the last 6 years with an outstanding team, from our employees, to our dealers and suppliers, and also, to get to know so many of our customers, investors and all of you who cover us.
During the last 6 years, our team has made incredible gains in how we bring new products to market, how we produce them and how we provide the best customer experience in the industry. We've significantly grown our global footprint and broadened our U.S. customer base. And while first quarter retail results didn't meet our expectations and we are adjusting shipments to manage supply in line with demand and protect our premium brand, the fact remains that Harley-Davidson stands in a position of great strength, thanks to the hard work of our entire team. We continue to improve our financial performance and operations, reflecting the ongoing power of our transformation and how it drives our operating effectiveness. Just to note a key measure of financial performance, the 39.1% gross margin percentage that we reported this morning is the highest in at least the last 15 years. We are the undeniable market leader in the 601cc-plus segment of the motorcycle market, with a broad and outstanding line of products and retail motorcycle sales 6x those of the nearest competitor in the U.S. The Harley-Davidson brand is among the most iconic on the planet, a position of strength that we've built over many decades. We've got incredible breadth and depth in our retail distribution and a compelling strategy that's focused on growing our reach to new customers in the U.S., growing internationally and continuously improving every aspect of how we operate.  As we noted in today's press release, we now have the breakout of Harley-Davidson's market share for 2014 by demographic group. And for the seventh straight year, we remain the #1 seller of new on-road motorcycles in the U.S. to each of the demographic groups that we track, both in the 601cc-plus segment and across on-road motorcycles of all displacements. 
Turning to international markets. While some parts of Europe were affected by currency and soft economic conditions in the first quarter, other parts of the EMEA region did well. For example, it was our best quarter ever in our Central, Eastern and Southeastern European markets as well as South Africa. In Asia Pacific, we had our strongest quarter ever in India and China as well as exceptional initial demand for the Street 750 in Korea, Vietnam and Thailand. And Street is doing very well in its initial rollout in Australia and New Zealand, among others. In Latin America, sales were up double digits in Mexico with about half of the increase coming from the Street 750. Clearly, Street is hitting the mark. 
I also want to touch on some recognition Harley-Davidson has received in recent weeks. We placed in the top 10 in the Forbes ranking of top employers in America based on a national survey of more than 20,000 employees at U.S. companies. And on the brand side, we were named 2015 Motorcycle Brand of the Year in the EquiTrend Harris Poll Annual Study of Brands that's based on familiarity, quality and consideration. I mention these as a reflection of the passion and dedication of our workforce as well as the power of our brand. Our team's many accomplishments during my time here demonstrate the power of our strategy and being customer-led, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone. And I personally believe Harley-Davidson's best days are yet to come.  Harley-Davidson has a remarkable leader in Matt Levatich as its next CEO. Matt has an outstanding track record. He knows this business in and out and has been a driving force behind our strategy with a vision to take Harley-Davidson to great places. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Matt."

I don't want to take too much time because I know there's a lot to get to, and I'll be talking with many of you again in the coming days and weeks.

Keith has always been too modest to take credit for returning Harley-Davidson to strength, establishing a culture of leadership and charting a clear vision and strategy for the future. But everyone associated with this company will continue to be inspired by his tremendous contributions. And we all have great confidence in the future from our position of strength and industry leadership. In his comments, Keith touched on a few of Harley's many strengths, from our incredibly talented and passionate employees and our powerful, global dealer network to our brand and industry leadership, our manufacturing, product development and retail prowess, our increasingly diverse customer base, and of course, our unrivaled motorcycles.
We've been in the motorcycle business continuously through all the many ups and downs for 112 years. For the last 6, we've built on our strengths and taken our capabilities to a whole new level, with agility to perform in a world and marketplace that is more dynamic and complex than ever. While our business and industry will always have challenges, Harley-Davidson also has incredible opportunities. We have a clear and compelling strategy and we're running this business for long-term performance. That means keeping on the throttle to further leverage our strong product development and manufacturing capabilities even as we increasingly focus on maximizing our potential at retail to grow internationally and to further broaden our reach with new customers here in the United States. 
As good as we may be today, we know we can build on our many strengths to be that much better tomorrow. So thank you.

Now let's discuss our first quarter financial results starting on Slide 13. During the quarter, Harley-Davidson, Inc. consolidated revenue was $1.67 billion. Net income in the quarter was $269.9 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.27. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was $345.5 million, slightly lower than last year's first quarter. Segment revenue was down 3.9% behind significantly unfavorable currency exchange and lower year-over-year shipments. Despite the lower revenue, the Motorcycle business operating margin was up 0.8 percentage points, driven by a  higher-gross-margin percent, and flat year-over-year SG&A spending.
Operating income at Harley-Davidson Financial Services was up 2.3% year-over-year. Also during the quarter, we had a lower effective tax rate.  We continue to focus on delivering strong margins, strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a closer look at first quarter performance starting with retail sales on Slide 14. Q1 was a tough quarter with worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles down 1.3% compared to last year's increase of 5.8%. Retail sales were soft in both the U.S. and several international regions during the quarter. First quarter worldwide retail sales continued to reflect an outstanding consumer response to our new models including Street, which sold very well in the initial rollout markets and in new markets which were added throughout the quarter. In the U.S., retail sales were impacted by increased competitive price discounting. The year-over-year comparison also reflects lapping the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore models. Internationally, sales were mainly impacted by lapping last year's favorable weather throughout Europe and also lapping the significant pull-forward of sales in Japan in advance of the April 2014 consumption tax increase. As we exited the first quarter, we believe our brand and core-demand fundamentals remained very strong. However, in the near term, our U.S. business is under pressure from increased, very aggressive, competitive discounting enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. Consequently, we believe, it is prudent to adjust our shipment planned for the full year. We now expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles worldwide, which represents growth of approximately 2% to 4% versus prior year. Our previous guidance was 282,000 to 287,000 motorcycles. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to support a healthy retail channel and protect our premium brand by aggressively managing supply in line with demand, as we have consistently done over the past several years.
Going forward, we expect continued success as we execute our long-term growth strategies. We remain very confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead.
Let's take a look at U.S. market on Slide 15. First quarter retail sales in the U.S. fell short of our expectations, down 0.7% compared to the prior year. We believe the factors that affected U.S. retail sales growth during the quarter were: First, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q1 2014 retail sales of non-Road Glide Touring motorcycles were up a very strong 35% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q1 2015. Second, we experienced adverse weather conditions in certain regions of the U.S. And finally, continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition, which increased from Q4 2014 and was up significantly compared to last year's first quarter. Given the levels of competitive inventories in the retail channel, coupled with foreign exchange that was favorable for our competitors, we expect aggressive discounting from the competition will continue for some time as they work through what we believe to be excessive retail inventory. 
Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success with our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street 750 sales continued to drive our performance in the Small Cruiser segment, which grew double digits on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the industry grew 9.0%. We had a very strong market share of 51.3%. We believe the -- however, our share was down 4.7 points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share in Q1 2015 was more severely impacted than we expected, as a result of increased price discounting by the competition. This is not the first time we've experienced period of extreme discounting by our competitors and likely won't be the last. However, we will continue to protect our premium brand. We will not take a short-term view of the current competitive situation and compete by discounting. We will continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long-term.  We continue to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and ship to the low end of our guidance. At the end of the first quarter, U.S. retail inventory was up 6,600 units on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to Street dealer fill, but also higher than expected due to soft retail sales in the quarter. 
On Slide 16, you will see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.4% in the first quarter as we lapped very strong year-ago retail sales growth of 10.9%. In our EMEA region, Q1 retail sales were down 5.6%, driven by lapping last year's very favorable weather conditions across Europe, current soft economic conditions in some markets and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we do not sell in local currencies, such as in Russia. Europe market share in Q1 was 9.8%, down 1.5 percentage points behind the introduction of several low-priced models by the competition.
In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were down 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline was entirely driven by the lapping of year-ago retail sales growth of 33.1% in Japan, as sales were pulled forward in advance of a consumption tax increase in April 2014. Excluding Japan, Q1 retail sales in the Asia Pacific region were up nearly 20%. Emerging markets within the region, especially India and China, continue to post very strong growth. 
Latin America region retail sales were up slightly in the quarter as a result of strong growth in Mexico, largely offset by soft retail sales in Brazil. Retail sales in Brazil have been impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition.
Finally, retail sales in Canada were up 5.7% in the first quarter, as we lapped currency-driven pricing actions initiated last year by our distributor. While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize strong international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 17, you'll see wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter were down 1.4% compared to last year. First quarter shipments finished near the low end of our expected range of 79,000 to 84,000 motorcycles, as we managed supply in line with lower-than-expected retail sales. During the quarter, the mix of Touring motorcycles increased 3.9 percentage points from the prior year as Rushmore models continued to be in high demand. Also during the quarter, the shipment mix of our Street and Sportster category was up 2.8 percentage points, reflecting our shipments of Street motorcycles in the quarter. Q1 2015 international shipments, as a percent of total, were 28.8%. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 18, you'll see revenue from the motorcycle and related products segment was down in the first quarter, driven by unfavorable currency exchange, and a 1.4% decrease in motorcycle shipments. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $405 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange, partially offset by higher pricing. On average, our key currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar by approximately 14% compared to Q1 2014. During the quarter, we took an off-model year price increase of 1.2% in Europe to help mitigate the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange in that region. Parts and Accessory revenue was down 7.2% in the first quarter, primarily driven by unfavorable currency exchange. General merchandise revenue was up 3.6% in the quarter. 
On Slide 19, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.1% which was 1.4 percentage points higher than last year. Gross margin performed very well, with price, mix, raw materials and manufacturing all being favorable during the quarter, partially offsetting unfavorable volume and foreign currency exchange. During the quarter, overall mix was a benefit of $9.1 million, largely driven by a rich sales mix of Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise. As expected, motorcycle family mix had an unfavorable impact on margin driven by higher Street shipments. The mix of models within families was also slightly unfavorable to prior year. Foreign currency exchange was $39.5 million unfavorable for the first quarter. This was driven by the significant weakening of our key foreign currencies within the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. The euro, yen, Brazilian real and Australian dollar devalued an average of 8% from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And we're 14% weaker compared to the prior-year quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately 3.5% and an unfavorable revaluation of foreign denominated assets on the balance sheet.  We are very pleased with our Q1 2015 gross margin percent growth. The record Q1 gross margin performance evidences that the underlying margin structure of the company is very strong. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations. 
On Slide 20, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was 22.9%, up 0.8 percentage points compared to last year's first quarter. Operating income of $345.5 million was down $2.2 million versus the prior year, driven by slightly unfavorable gross margin dollars, and relatively flat SG&A spending. We were very pleased with our ability to leverage both our gross margin and operating margin as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now moving on to our Financial Services Segment on Slide 21. In the first quarter, HDFS's operating profits increased $1.5 million or 2.3% compared to last year. The primary factors impacting first quarter results were: First, net interest income was favorable to prior year by $4.4 million, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Second, the provision for retail credit losses was unfavorable to prior year by $5.4 million due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in the reserve rate. Finally, HDFS had strong increases in its insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the first quarter. We were very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business remained very profitable with industry-leading returns. 
Now let's take a look at HDFS's operations on Slide 22. During the first quarter, HDFS's retail motorcycle loan originations increased 3.2%, or $19.3 million, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.3 percentage point increase in retail financing market share for the first quarter compared to last year and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle.
Finance receivables outstanding increased 6.6% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in both the retail and wholesale portfolios. We believe the overall loan portfolio was solid, comprised of profitable loans funded in the prime and subprime segments. In Q1 2015, approximately 80% of our new motorcycle loan originations were prime. 
Moving on to credit performance on Slide 23. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at March 31 was 2.64% or 2 basis points lower than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at record [Audio Gap] points to 1.56% compared to last year's first quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses, in line with increased subprime originations in recent years. [Audio Gap] during the first quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position, delivered solid credit performance and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Now let's take a look at cash and liquidity on Slide 24. You will see, at the end of the quarter we had $1.23 billion of cash and marketable securities. In addition, we had $1.88 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. We currently have, and intend to [indiscernible] , facilities. During the first quarter we successfully completed a $700 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.19%. We also completed a $600 million, 5-year medium-term note offering with a coupon of 2.15%. Additionally, in the first quarter, HDFS paid $100 million dividend to HD, Inc. We further demonstrated our efforts to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.9 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $182.5 million during the quarter. Returning values to our shareholders is a top priority. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.
Now I'll review the remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financials on Slide 25. I'd like to highlight 2 items: First, with regards to operating cash flow, the company generated operating cash of $174.7 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was down $28.9 million from last year, driven by higher working capital and higher wholesale finance originations. And second, first quarter tax rate was 34.4% compared to 35.0% in the year-ago period. 
On Slide 26, you will see our overall expectations for 2015. In 2015, we now expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles on a worldwide basis, up approximately 2% to 4% from 2014 shipments, but approximately 6,000 fewer motorcycles than prior guidance. We believe it is prudent to adjust our plan at this time given the increased aggressive price discounting that is occurring in the U.S. market. We believe the underlying worldwide demand fundamentals for Harley-Davidson motorcycles remains strong, despite the aggressive competitive discounting that is occurring. We are committed to protecting our premium brand and will keep our focus on the long-term sustainability of our business. During the second quarter, we expect to ship 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles, which is down approximately 5% to 10% compared to last year's second quarter shipments. For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the Motorcycles segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014.
In 2015, we expect gross margin will be flat to up modestly compared to 2014, impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact for motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, increased pension expense and unfavorable mix. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%, 1 percentage point worse than we anticipated on our January call, as currencies continued to devalue during the quarter. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange impact to be considerably worse than the first quarter's $39.5 million reduction. Assuming yesterday's exchange rates hold for the entire quarter, we would expect second quarter revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5%, with approximately 60% of the revenue decline adversely impacting second quarter's gross margin dollars. We believe second quarter gross margin will be down approximately 2.5 percentage points versus last year's gross margin percent, driven by unfavorable currency, lower production as we adjust to lower shipment expectations and unfavorable mix during the quarter compared to last year. 
Looking at SG&A, we now expect spending to be flat to down in 2015 as we work to mitigate the adverse impact of lower revenues. In addition, we continue to expect that SG&A will decline as a percent of revenue. For HDFS, we expect operating income will be down modestly in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of higher credit losses and tightening net interest margins due to increasing competition and rising borrowing costs. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to be between $240 million, $260 million, as we increase investment in product development focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. 
So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant price discounting in the U.S., we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the quarter. We successfully increased gross and operating margin percent, continued to grow outreach in excess of 2x our core customer growth in the U.S., expanded distribution of Street into many new international markets, expanded our international dealer network and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of $183 million in company shares. For the remainder of 2015, we will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

Now in 20",272,"Okay, the first question, Sharon is, have we seen other times, in particular when you look back over about the last 15 years, there's 2 times in which Harley-Davidson lost share, largely due to competitive discounting. That was in 2000 and 2008. Now in 2000 -- by 2002, market share was back. And we lost about 3 points in both cases, in 2000 and 2008. And in 2008, we lost 3 points of market share, and then in 2009 we gained back 8.5 points. So this has happened before, we expect it to happen again. And the way that we've managed it, is the way we've always managed our great premium brand, is that we're not going to jump in and respond to price discounting by discounting on our -- discounting our great brand. We're managing this for the long-term value of the brand and the company and suck industry profits out of it by lowering margin and selling non-full margin product is not the way to do it. Again, and history shows that market share will come back in a short period of time. So we're going to continue to manage this thing for the long-term and do what's right for the brand overall. In terms of, I think your third question, Sharon, was on Europe, and on the price increase took effect about a month ago. It was 1.2%, given the overall devaluation in Europe, which is significantly more than that. We're balancing that with the competitive set there. And we have not seen any -- not long enough to get a read on any impact of the price increase."

I mean, I know you have given a lot of color about the competition and why you're doing it. But again, reactive, proactive, that would be helpful. And then also, you did give some color about this and how you're planning on offsetting the pressures of the deleveraging effect of lower unit sales and FX on gross margins. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically about the efficiencies that you're enjoying there to help offset some of that? And then just, finally, now you're back half loaded pretty significantly, so what gives you your confidence in that?"

The guidance reduction -- the first question was with regards to the guidance reduction, is it proactive or reactive?

The guidance reduction -- the first question was with regards to the guidance reduction, is it proactive or reactive? We'd called out in the fourth quarter that we saw the competitive discounting increase quite dramatically in the fourth quarter. And at that time, we said 2/3 of our competition had stepped up.
Moving to the first quarter, we are seeing a couple of things happen from what we saw in the first quarter. Both the depth and the breadth of the discounting has increased quite significantly from the fourth quarter. We are seeing discounts now up to $3,000 a bike. We're also seeing our competition reprice with lower MSRPs, some cases up to 25%. And -- so with that, the answer to your question, it is both reactive and proactive. We do expect that this is more of a fundamental change. There is excess inventory in the channel. And there is a newfound money by our competition, which is largely Japanese and European competitors, that have seen their economics shift quite dramatically in the last 3 quarters. So we believe that price discounting will continue for a few to several more quarters. And therefore, we're certainly being proactive, because we're not going to discount and what we're going to do is take down our volume. We're going to continue to invest in the equity side of the business and building the brand and the lifestyle aspects of it, but we're not going to participate in discounting. So we're lowering our volume 6,000 units and going to continue to sell full-margin motorcycles, as we move into the future. So a little bit reactive on what we lost in the first quarter, but much more proactive on what we expect over the next couple of quarters. Thanks for asking that. I don't want it to go unnoticed that we had a record gross margin in the first quarter, 39.1% which was up 1.4 percentage points, and that's despite a currency headwind of -- what amounted to 1.2 points of gross margin. So we couldn't be more pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our margin structure and how things are proceeding. And a lot of that is driven in the manufacturing line item. And the plants are running very well. Continuous improvement here is an everyday thing and we continue to find ways to take costs out of the business and to drive things forward. We've talked about our pricing and our ability to price, and that's driving a lot of the favorability in the quarter as well."

And so in the first quarter, in the quarter where weather was worse on a year-over-year basis, you're right, James, we saw our competition up about 20%, incredible amount of money coming into the category and lowering the average prices of motorcycles. Again, discounts up to $3,000, repricing MSRP. That's the only way it's possible. And yes, we're seeing the share loss come predominantly to price discounters, and mainly the Japanese. And again, we have experienced this in the past, we'll experience it in the future. When you look at what they're doing and kind of, again, a difference from the fourth quarter to what we're seeing now, is in the fourth quarter they predominantly were discounting model -- old model-year products, so '14, '13 and '12s. Now, we're seeing a migration to discounting of more current model-year product, again, leading us to believe that this is going to be a few quarters out, that it will continue. We are seeing the discounting across everything. And it's not only the categories which we compete in, which are our Touring and Cruiser segments, but also we're seeing it in performance bikes, we're seeing it in dual, and we're seeing it in standard. So it is pretty pervasive. When you look at where it's hitting the hardest in terms of Harley-Davidson, that would be in the Large Cruiser segment. And again, to give an example to dimensionalize it, if you look at the Large Cruiser segment where we have our Softails, Dynas and V-Rods competing, the competition grew that segment about 70% in the first quarter. And again, that doesn't happen in a mature category without a shock to it, and that is the favorability that they're receiving on foreign exchange being spent in that way."

John, just to follow on to the previous question, as you said, we've seen this discounting in the past and Harley has rebounded from it. From what we hear from the dealers though, also it would appear that within the custom category, and especially the Sportster category, it's a matter of those products being a little longer in the tooth. You guys have done a lot of innovation obviously in the Touring and with the Street, but you can't do everything at once. But it would seem that the Sportster and the Custom are a little long in the tooth. Could the combination of that and the discounting be the root of the issue here?

So the shipment ramp in the second quarter, so let's kind of run through where we're at, where shipments were down 1.4% in the first quarter. Our guidance for 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles in the second quarter is down 5% to 10%. So if you work that math out, you're down about 3% to 6% in the first half, which has an implied growth in the back half of about 16% on average. So we are back loading the second half. The reason being is, all of the -- basically the 6,000 units are coming out, we're taking out in the second quarter, another opportunity to exercise our flexible manufacturing. If you remember a year ago in the second quarter, weather was very difficult and we ended up with higher inventories than we had wanted at the end of the second quarter and we fixed that in the third quarter. And at this point, we will bring inventories down in the second quarter. So taking the $6,000 guidance reduction out in the second quarter and fixing inventories or bringing inventories where they should be at the end of the second quarter requires us to have more shipments in the back half. We feel very comfortable with that split. And again, as we've always said and we've certainly demonstrated, we're going to aggressively manage supply in line with demand and make sure that the marketplace is clean as we move forward. The second question that you had, Joe, is with regards to the North and the South and weather and so on and so forth. If you look at the overall weather from the weather services was pretty even on a year round [Audio Gap] precipitation. But when you look at it, this winter was a harder first quarter than last year because of the timing of when the weather hit and certainly the excessive snowfall in the Northeast. We have 7 sales region and of those 7, 3 of them were down considerably, that represent about 40% of our volume. And the Northeast being down the most, which was down double digits. Now in the areas that didn't have the weather issues, sales were very strong and we feel great about where we're at, and that was led by the West which was up double digits. And that's the second year in a row that the first quarter was up over double digits in the West. So again, it was clearly a weather issue. It was not a product or mix or the inventories that we had in those markets or uneven competition, it was clearly the weather."

So the first question was to expound upon a little bit more on the currency in the quarter. So what we had, at the top line, our revenue was impacted by $53.8 million, and that was that 14% devaluation which is the average exchange rates between the first quarter of this year versus last year. And so with revenue down $53.8 million, which is equivalent to 3.5%, we did have a pickup in cost of goods sold of $14.3 million and that was a result of the natural hedges that we have. So some of our parts that we make motorcycles in the United States would come from foreign markets, and so there's a natural hedge there, and then also financial hedges that we had. Those 2 gains were largely offset by the revaluation of our assets. So we have to look and we mark our assets from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. There was an 8% devaluation within the quarter and that generated a significant loss on the revaluation of those assets. That's more of a onetime loss and will reverse itself when currencies come back. But that minimized the impact of those hedges. Therefore that drove the $39.5 million hit to gross margin, which equated to 1.2 points of gross margin and about $0.10 of earnings per share. The other question that you had asked is with regards to competitive pricing, yes, we're well aware that Indian is discounting a fair amount as well. Most of the conversations that we've had has been on currency-driven discounting. But all of our competitors are -- most -- every competitor is discounting, including Indian. And there are probably similar levels to the Japanese in a lot of respects."

And then secondly, if the currencies stay where they are, you said that, that would be about a 4.25% impact on revenues, so about a $240 million headwind on the motorcycle business. And presumably, that would be where the earnings impact would be, if you didn't have these hedges. You indicated about a 50% passthrough, so $120 million. But it sounds like, based on your guidance, that you are seeing about $95 million in the first half, which leaves only about $25 million in the back half.

Again, as I had mentioned, the ongoing continuous improvement, the way we're operating the plants is all going very well. There is a onetime that we're lapping in manufacturing expense, and that's the Street start-up costs. If you will remember a year ago, we had a fair amount of start-up cost with Street. That was about $4.7 million, $5 million. And so we are lapping that so that would provide some of that benefit that we saw in manufacturing. But that's the core level of profitability. We're just lapping that piece of it. The second question that you had is with regards to our full year guidance. In terms of revenue, 4.25%, you had used a number of $240 million, we won't comment on that. But 50% of it will fall down and hit gross margin in an adverse fashion. We'll pick up some of that in SG&A. The question that you asked is with regards to the magnitude of, I guess, the first half revenue hit and gross margin hit versus the back half. And the worst quarter that we're going to have, if everything again remains constant, is the second quarter. And that's because a year ago, our foreign currencies were the strongest in the second quarter and then we saw late in the third quarter that the currency started to devalue, so we'll be lapping that as we get toward the end of the year. So yes, you're right, the biggest magnitude of impact of foreign currency will be in the first half of the year and more specifically in the second quarter."

But dealer inventory -- international is on a different inventory system. Our dealers pull -- when they sell one, they pull one. We call it pipeline. So inventory is more company-owned internationally than dealer-owned. And we have very little change in dealer inventories from period-to-period just because of the way that we supply our dealer network. And any inventories would be more company-owned inventories as they fluctuate up and down. So inventories are just different than in the United States where we push the inventory out to the dealers after we manufacture them. Second question, is price competition global, no, we're not seeing global price competition. Our competitors are largely Japanese and European. They're certainly realizing a strong benefit when they sell in the United States. But otherwise, we're not seeing any huge price competition outside of Brazil in our foreign markets. The final question was, is the percent of revenue at HDFS, should you be concerned with regards to that and the currency impact on HDFS, the answer is no. HDFS is predominantly in the United States and Canada. They do help with arrangements around the world, but the vast majority of revenue is here in North America."

As you know, this is my first earnings call as President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, but this is far from my first earnings cycle here. As a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson tea",1010,"Thanks, Amy, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As you know, this is my first earnings call as President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, but this is far from my first earnings cycle here. As a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson team, I'm not only incredibly proud of where this company's been, I'm incredibly excited about where we're going. You've all read the headlines and results in the new release this morning; sales shipments and earnings were in line with our expectations. As always, John will go into the detailed financials behind that in a few minutes, but first, I want to take a second and talk about the big picture of the quarter, the environment we're in and why I'm encouraged about both our performance and our prospects. 
In April, we acknowledged the environment was going to be difficult in the face of currency and discounting by competitors, but we didn't sit on our hands. We leveraged our strengths, pulled together as a team, and came to the table to compete and win. The tough call  in April to take down shipments was the right call and reflects our long-standing commitment to manage supply in line with demand. The fact that we delivered shipments in line with that guidance in the second quarter while maintaining near-record gross margin shows the strength and flexibility we've built on the operations side of the business. But of equal or greater importance in my mind is our commitment to drive demand and do so in ways that are reinforcing of our premium brand. Harley-Davidson has powerful fundamental strengths and assets and we leverage some of the many competitive advantages we have like HDFS, our Riding Academy, our richly iconic brand and our great dealer network to drive demand in the quarter. For example, in the U.S., we implemented targeted financing offers through HDFS and we rolled out free rider training to active and veteran military personnel through our Riding Academy. The outstanding response to the Riding Academy program reflects its power and potential as a conduit to this sport through our brand, our retail channel and through great products like The Street, which we use in support of Riding Academy training. 
We believe that taken together, our actions to drive demand had a positive impact on retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increasing momentum in the U.S. with near double-digit growth in June's retail sales of new Harleys. In fact, it was our strongest June retail motorcycle sales in the United States since 2008. In Europe, we also stepped up our marketing efforts and saw growth a new motorcycle sales return in June. At the same time, sales of new Harleys in the Asia Pacific region were up strongly in the quarter, driven in part by the great reception to our Street motorcycles, in particular in China and India. In fact, the Harley Davidson Street 750 was the best-selling new Harley ever in the region when it comes to first year sales. Street has also been very successful in bringing new riders into the Harley-Davidson brand both in the U.S. and internationally. In its initial year alone, 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street motorcycles in the United States. Those customers were new to the brand. In EMEA, it was 9 out of 10, and in India, nearly all Street customers were new to our brand. We believe this success underscores the large untapped potential in our business, not to mention what happens when we deliver for customers with great products like Street and we will continue to aggressively tap that potential. 
During the second quarter, we also demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns when we announced our intent to leverage the current environment and our strong balance sheet to increase share repurchases. This decision was driven by what we believe to be a favorable credit environment and our current share price which we believe was inordinately influenced by near-term headwinds, including currency exchange rates. On the operations side, we plan to close on a preannounced transaction with our Canadian distributor in early August and transition to direct distribution in Canada. We have a strong team in place and look forward to all the opportunities and efficiencies we expect to create in that market. 
Looking ahead, we're excited about the 2016 model year motorcycle launch and bringing our global dealer network together for our annual dealer meeting in late August. The dealer meeting is always a highlight of my year because it's a time when we come together, align and share in the mutual pride of being in Harley-Davidson motorcycle business and inspire and motivate the best dealers in the industry. 
Before I turn it over to John, I want to reiterate how proud I am of this company, this team and all of the work that's being done in Harley-Davidson each and every day. Every quarter and every year, we'll have challenges. But we can probably all agree the second quarter retail numbers were not as good as we'd all like, we're energized by the challenges and the competition. Headwinds like these are nothing we haven't seen before in our 112 years. We see them as catalysts for getting stronger, and we are. Make no mistake, driving demand and growing the business are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson, even as we address the near-term market condition, our eyes and our energy are clearly focused on our strategies for growth and continued industry leadership long term. These strategies include rolling out great new products, growing sales to U.S. outreach customers faster than to core, bringing increasing numbers of new customers into the brand internationally and taking the Harley-Davidson retail experience to new heights, all in ways aimed to make Harley-Davidson the most customer-led company in the world. We're confident in the strength in our business, our strategies and our team. We're strong in our leadership position, we're managing the business for the long-term and we're here to win. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on Slide 10. Results were in line with our expectations given lower shipmen",927,"Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on Slide 10. Results were in line with our expectations given lower shipments in the quarter following the shipment guidance reduction we took in April. During the quarter, revenue was $1.82 billion, net income was $299.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, all down on lower shipments and ongoing pressure from unfavorable currency exchange. As expected, operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down 19.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Motorcycles segment operating performance continues to be very strong when considering the lower volumes and unfavorable currency impact. The Motorcycle business operating margin was down 2.7 percentage points driven by higher SG&A spending on lower revenues, while gross margin remained very strong at 39.2%.  At HDFS, operating income was up 10.0% year-over-year. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a closer look at Q2 performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. As we continue to face a very challenging retail environment in many markets, worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the second quarter. In the U.S., retail sales were down 0.7% as we continued to experience pressure from foreign exchange driven discounting by other brands and as we lapped last year's strong Rushmore sales. Internationally, retail sales were mainly impacted by new low-priced models from competitors in Europe, currency driven volume declines in markets where we sell in non-local currencies and challenging economic conditions in some markets. As we exited the second quarter, our business remains under pressure from increased competitive activity, including aggressive price discounting in the U.S., enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. We have taken action around the world in a manner which will reinforce our brand premium. We are very pleased that our market actions helped drive very strong sales results in the month of June. We remain confident in our worldwide motorcycle shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% for the full year. We expect second half retail sales growth to be driven by our continued demand driving market actions that we've initiated in various world markets, the continued worldwide rollout of our Street motorcycles, ongoing international dealer expansion, the introduction of our 2016 model year motorcycles in late August and our ongoing brand strength. We remain focused on delivering the Harley-Davidson customer experience to riders around the world. We expect to grow the appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, expand international sales and increase sales to outreach customers in the U.S. We are confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 12. Second quarter retail sales were down 0.7% in the U.S. Excluding the fleet of Street motorcycles for rider training registered by dealers during last year's second quarter, sales would have been up 2.1% year-over-year. We believe the factors that were underlying U.S. retail sales results during the quarter were: first, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q2 24 [ph] retail sales of Touring models were up a very strong 31% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q2 2015. Second, we experienced continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition. Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success in our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street motorcycles sales continued to drive our performance in small cruisers, which grew double digits year-over-year. To counter the competitive environment in the U.S. market, we've initiated a 3 pronged market action plan which includes lifestyle and brand advertising and marketing, targeted finance offers and leveraging H-D's others competitive advantages such as Riding Academy and our dealer network. The bulk of these market driving actions were introduced in late May through mid-June. While it is still early, we believe these activities are having a positive impact on our retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increased momentum resulting in near double-digit growth in June's retail sales. 
Turning to market share, during the quarter, U.S. industry grew at 6.8%. We had a very strong market leadership share of 47.5% and believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter bodes well for motorcycling. However, our Q2 market share was down 2.8 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last 3 quarters was more severely impacted than we had expected as a result of increased price discounting by the competition and inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. We are pleased to see a moderation in market share loss from the first quarter decline of 4.7 percentage points and believe the improvement is driven by strong brand strategy and recent market share actions to drive demand in this tough competitive environment. This is not the first time we've experienced period of extreme discounting by competitors and likely it won't be the last. However, we will protect our brand premium. We will not take a short-term view and compete with brand damaging discounting, nor will we ship out-of-balance retail demand. We continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long-term. At the end of the second quarter, U.S. retail sales was down approximately 1,600 motorcycles on a year-over-year basis"

Excluding incremental retail dealer fill of Street motorcycles, Q2 retail inventory was down significantly as expected. We were very pleased with inventory levels at the end of Q2. This reflects the benefits of our flexible manufacturing capability and our commitment to manage supply in line with demand. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.7% in the second quarter. We initiated market actions to counter increased competitive activities and weak economic trends in certain international markets. Similar to the U.S., we initiated these activities in mid-to-late second quarter, and we were very encouraged by June's retail sales results. In the EMEA region, retail sales were down as the region experienced the impact of several low-priced models introduced by competitive brands and lapped strong year ago retail sales of 7.0%. In addition, we experienced currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in non-local currencies such as in Russia. Year-to-date market -- year-to-date Europe market share was 10.2%, down 1.9 percentage points behind the impact of low-priced models introduced by the competition in the performance and standards segments, market segments where Harley-Davidson's motorcycles do not compete. In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were up 16.6% in the quarter. The region experienced growth in all major markets, and in particular in our emerging markets, led by India and China. Driving these results is The Street motorcycle, which launched in many Asia Pacific markets in the first half of 2015. Street makes entry into the Harley-Davidson brand more attainable for riders around the world, and the early results are very exciting. Retail sales in Japan were up, and they were impacted by the restructuring of distribution in that market, including a new pipeline distribution process and rationalizing the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience. Latin America region retail sales were down modestly in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil, largely offset by strong growth in Mexico. Retail sales in Brazil continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down behind a highly competitive environment coinciding with the transition of the business from a distributor to direct distribution. While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are confident in our current market efforts and remain focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were down 7.6% compared to last year and within our expected range of 83 to 88,000 in motorcycles. The overall shipment makes reflects higher concentration of Street as we continue the global rollout of these models. As we exited Q2 2015, we believe U.S. retail inventories in the dealer network were at appropriate levels. Q2 2015 international shipments were 35.3% of total shipments. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles segment was down Q2 compared to last year driven by 7.6% lower motorcycle shipments and unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 4.6%. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $692 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Parts and accessories revenue fell 5.4% driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. General Merchandise revenue was up 1.5% driven by robust international growth, largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.2%, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange and lower volumes. During the quarter, overall mix was unfavorable $16.5 million, largely driven by family mix, which included a higher mix of Street motorcycles and a lower mix of Touring motorcycles. Foreign currency exchange was $36.1 million unfavorable for the second quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies. Key currencies devalued an average of 19% compared to the prior-year quarter. Our Q2 2015 gross margin as a percent of revenue exceeded our expectations as foreign currency exchange came in better-than-expected behind some strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates within the quarter and better-than-expected manufacturing productivity. Our Q2 2015 gross margin of 39.2% is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 23.1% down 2.7 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to increased marketing investment as we address the highly competitive environment. Also, SG&A expenses in the quarter included recall reserves of $16.4 million, which included a voluntary recall in Touring motorcycles that we incurred late in the quarter. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. HDFS has a strategic competitive advantage for Harley-Davidson. It enables wholesale and retail sales of our Harley-Davidson motorcycles and delivers attractive returns for the company. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased 10.0% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year, driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Also, HDFS had increase in insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the second quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business continued to be very profitable with industry-leading returns. HDFS' second quarter operations are summarized on Slide 19. HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 7.0% compared to last year's second quarter, primarily driven by a 6.8 percentage point increase in our U.S. retail finance market share and higher average amount financed per motorcycle. Finance receivables outstanding increased 5.0% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in the retail portfolio. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company. At the end of the quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.84 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. Finally, during the second quarter, we successfully completed a $500 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.16%. 
Credit performance tracked very well during the quarter. On Slide 20, you will see that 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at June 30, 2015 was 2.71% or 3 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels. Annual credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.08% compared to last year's second quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime originations in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior. During the second quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
The Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $613.9 million in the first half of this year. Operating cash was up $43.4 million from last year, driven by lower net wholesale lending, partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 22, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share and we repurchased 2.8 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $164.8 million. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.  To that end, on Slide 23, you'll see that last month, we announced our plan to add debt to the corporate balance sheet in order to enhance our share repurchase efforts and deliver additional value to our shareholders. On June 17, we announced that we plan to incur $750 million of long-term debt, with the intent to use the funds to repurchase shares of the company's stock. We expect to incur the debt in the next couple of speaks and complete the share repurchases by the end of this year. The repurchases would be an addition to our ongoing share repurchase plan, which we expect to be in line with last year's second half repurchases of $392 million. We believe this recapitalization is a great opportunity to increase our long-term shareholders ownership in the company without an adverse impact to the long-term value of the brand or the business. 
Our guidance is on Slide 24. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect to ship 276 to 281,000 motorcycles. Given our first-half results, we have a challenging back half to achieve our shipment guidance. We are confident that we are taking appropriate market actions to accelerate growth in the back half without participating in brand damaging motorcycle discounting. During the third quarter, we expect to ship 54 to 59,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 6.5% to 16.5% compared to last year's third quarter shipments. For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the Motorcycles segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we now expect gross margin to be up modestly compared to 2014 impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin to be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange and increased pension expense. To dimentionalize the the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 3/4 of a percent. For the third quarter, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates, we expect revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5% with about 40% of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the quarter, reducing gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. We now expect SG&A spending will be up modestly in 2015 both in absolute spending and as a percent of revenue due to the recall expenses and investment in market driving activities. For HDFS, we now expect operating income to be up modestly in 2015 compared to 2014. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2015 to be between $240 million, $260 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. Finally, we continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. This guidance does not include the impact of the anticipated Canadian distributor transaction. We expect the financial impact to be dilutive in 2015 to earnings per share by approximately $0.04 behind upfront transition costs. This impact would be realized largely in the third quarter. 
So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant competitive pressures around the world, we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the second quarter. We successfully maintained a strong gross margin percent despite lower volumes and unfavorable currency exchange, implemented market driving actions which drove June retail sales, expanded distribution of Street in the new international markets and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of 165 million in company shares and announced a $3.25 billion recapitalization. For the second half of 2015, we will navigate a challenging business environment. We remain confident in our shipment guidance and the actions we are taking to support retail sales in the second half of the year. We will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

You're absolutely right, it's very difficult to pinpoint an absolute percent of cannibalization, but we believe it's very low. And some of that is evidenced by the last 4 quarters. We have seen our small cruisers which includes Sportster and Street grow well into the double digits behind Street in the United States. Internationally, certainly, most all customers coming in are new to the brand. As Matt had mentioned, 9 out of 10 in Europe are new to the brand and almost all of the folks in India are new. So we couldn't be more excited. The rollout has gone very well internationally and it's certainly providing and filling in the role that was intended to be in the United States."

I'm wondering if you could just talk about the implied fourth quarter guidance. If you take the midpoint of the third quarter and the midpoint of full year, that implies unit shipments of 21% in the fourth quarter. So seasonally, that just seems high to us given -- I mean, it seems high given the seasonality and then also given the strategy of aligning shipment with demand. So if you could touch upon that. And just as a follow-up, I was just wondering if you can help us understand the cadence of retail sales in the quarter. I think the conventional wisdom was that retail sales were down earlier in the quarter and then ramp at the end. Just wondering if you could address the cadence."

So 2 pieces, let's separate 2 pieces of the first question is retail and shipments. So retail sales were down 1.4% in the first half, and we are expecting retail sales certainly to accelerate in the back half of the year that supports",749,"Thank you, Felicia. So 2 pieces, let's separate 2 pieces of the first question is retail and shipments. So retail sales were down 1.4% in the first half, and we are expecting retail sales certainly to accelerate in the back half of the year that supports our shipment guidance, which is up 2 to 4 percentage points. But shifting to the specific question, Felicia, on shipments, if we look at overall shipments in the first half of this year, we were down 4.7% in shipments. And as you look at kind of year-to-date, year to go to hit that 2.4 -- 2% to 4% shipment growth guidance, we would need our shipments to be up 14% to 19%. So let's start out with the half and then we'll get into the 2 quarters in the back half. The reason that we're looking to ship more in the back half of the year is not really related to retail sales, it's related to what happened last year. Felicia, if you remember last year, we had a very terrible, very tough weather in the United States. And consequently, we ended up shipping in more motorcycles in the first half than retail sales warranted. And then we spent the second half taking production and shipments out of the back half to get inventories back in line. Consequently, last year, at the end of the second quarter, our retail inventories were up too high and resulted in more carryover units than we would have liked. So again, our focus is always on aggressively managing supply in line with demand, making sure we're adequately supplying the market. So what we did this year is just to reverse out what happened last year. So we shipped in less this year than we retailed in order to bring down second quarter retail inventories this year and we couldn't be happier as to where we're at. As we had mentioned, we were down 1,600 units but when you just out The Street motorcycles, inventories are down significantly in line with where we believe we need to be to have a very smooth transition into the new model year 2016 motorcycles. And consequently, because we were down so much in last year's second-half in shipments, we will become coincidingly up 14% to 19%. Now what you've done is taken our shipment guidance of 54 to 59,000 in the third quarter and seeing that overall, shipment, that suggested shipments will be higher in the fourth quarter and that is true. And so now when we look at the back half of those 2 quarters, we are moving production from the first part of the year to the fourth quarter. And the reason being is we become very good at flexible manufacturing. And we have matched up our production with our demand very well, given the manufacturing system that we have. But as we looked at last year, that required a fair amount of down days in the fourth quarter and probably hurt efficiencies a little bit. So what we want to do is balance out production a little bit in the back half of the year between the third and fourth quarters. That will have a little bit of  a headwind in terms of gross margin between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But on aggregate, it won't have an impact. So again, we're smoothing out production a little bit, that's translating into a little bit more shipments in the fourth quarter. The second question that you asked is the cadence in second quarter retail sales. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've got a three-pronged approach to addressing the competitiveness. And we're addressing that in Harley-Davidson's way, which is not price discounting. We've talked about this the last time, we will not meet discounting with discounting, we will not put hang tags on our motorcycles. That's certainly the easiest way to address some of the competitiveness we're experiencing in the United States. So with this three-pronged approach, most of those activities got into the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June, and we've seen very strong results coming from that. And so in April and May, retail sales were pretty soft, softer than we saw in the third quarter. However, June, we built very strong momentum and we're up near double digits in the United States, as well as near double digit in international markets behind the investments that we've made kind of closed that competitive gap."

Again, the bulk of that we're seeing in the shipment cadence and shipping more in the second half than in the first half is to correct last year's shipping patterns that were disrupted by the unfavorable weather. Clearly, as we look at our production, as well as our shipments, we're taking into account various market activities. Certainly our new products that are coming out. And so all of that is considered. But the biggest driver in the splits of being down in the first half to up in the second half is really what happened last year and getting those inventories in line. When we talk about inventory growth, I would assume, Craig, that you're referring to at the end of the year. We expect and continue to expect inventory at the end of the year to be flat to up modestly, and that does take into account the various models that we have in the marketplace. And -- I'm sorry, thank you, Amy. That is -- that answers, with regards to the United States, that we expect to be flat to up modestly. Internationally, we do expect inventories to rise as we add new dealer points. And we're continuing on a similar pattern of adding dealers that we were in previous years. Actually, in the quarter, we added 11 new dealers which we're very thrilled about. So with that, internationally, we will be putting more inventory to support that growth."

However, when we look at that, number one is we are expecting retail grow",372,"Thanks, James. The first question, industry growth and our retail, so what we have said is that we expect flat-to-modestly upgrowth and that is tied to basically holding terms flat. However, when we look at that, number one is we are expecting retail growth in the back half, and we're certainly expecting to support our shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% withholding those inventories at year end in the United States. And we're also looking when we talk about inventory, we are looking at forward turns and what we expect to sell into the future as well. The second question that you had, James, is with regards to market trends. Why don't we start out with the first half? We have had a tough half, largely driven by the price discounting, but overall market share was down 3.5 percentage points. The bulk of that share loss is due to price competition in the marketplace. The second biggest driver of the market share loss in the first half was the inclusion of autocycles in the motorcycle industry numbers. And this is a vehicle that's included, that's very car-like, it's got side-by-side seating, gas pedal and breaks, steering wheel, very large front end. It just happens to have a single wheel in the back. States are having trouble figuring out what it is in terms of it is a motorcycle, is it registrable, is it an autocycle. But in any event, we do not believe it competes directly with traditional motorcycles, but it is having a large impact on our overall market share because we're 50% of the market. So those about are the 2 largest drivers of market share losses. As we move forward, we expect certainly our share losses to mitigate. We saw that in the quarter. If you look within the quarter, we kind of talked about the retail sales cadence within the quarter which improved very much the previous question, but market share as well improved significantly in the quarter as we got some of our market response actions out. So as we move forward, we would expect market shares to temper, especially in the fourth quarter when we start to lap the initial impact of the price discounting."

We're reporting results as of the end of the second quarter and we're not going to go beyond that. But again, what we saw in the first quarter and the change and shift in momentum",530,"We exited the quarter with good momentum, and we're very pleased with that. We're reporting results as of the end of the second quarter and we're not going to go beyond that. But again, what we saw in the first quarter and the change and shift in momentum, we feel very good about our overall second half. The second question is with regards to what we had talked about in addressing some of the competitive issues. We got a three-pronged approach and you can see most notably in there is brand damaging discounting is not a part of it. So we're very pleased with what we've got. It's not as easy, it's not as quick. We've got to be a lot more creative in how we do it, and the results are very strong. And we look at the various pieces, they all work in concert with each other, right. When you look at the lifestyle and brand advertising, that's an investment in the future and an investment in the brand and the brand premium. Hard to measure what that does on a day-to-day basis. And the second piece of it is targeted finance offers. That is trying to close some of the competitive gap that we have in the marketplace. We never talk much about discounting but it certainly has not improved on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It remains consistent to a little bit increase. We're seeing a couple more competitors and we're also seeing the level go up a little bit. The top discount out there is $4,000 a motorcycle. So the targeted finance offers are just that, very targeted and they allow us to work on some of that price gap. I will also say that being able to do this with HDFS is absolutely a fantastic benefit and advantage to us. We've immediately got over 700 dealers in the United States, we can access some -- we can offer the same thing, and we can get execution very pristine across the U.S. And certainly, HDFS is proving to be a tremendous advantage. And then the last piece is really leveraging some of our competitive advantages, things that we have that no one else does. First and foremost is the dealer network and getting their focus where we needed to be. And then the second, our assets such as Rider Academy. And so a program like this, Matt had mentioned it in his prepared remarks, is we offer free rider training to all veteran and active military folks. And this is an incredibly brand enhancing opportunity for us. And it comes at a very efficient price. So we're not seeing the benefits of that in the first half. We launched that in the middle of May and we've seen overwhelming response, of interest, and what's going to take these folks to get enrolled in Riding Academy, complete the course and then purchase a motorcycle. So this is something that's going to drive more in the second half certainly than they did in the first half and it will be a very strong, brand enhancing point with about 1/3 of our customers buying new motorcycle at any given year."

I think the energy that we put in, in the quarter is really smart, creative, reinforcing ways to compete. And so as an example, we've talked a lot internally about the simple truth that a dollar invested in pulling forward a sale is a dollar wasted. So our energy is around high-quality things that convey the core meaning, the core value of joining the Harley-Davidson brand versus another choice people might have. I think the Rider Academy veterans program is a great example of the kind of great work that we're doing internally to do smart things to grow the business long-term. As John mentioned, practically none of that investment is in the second quarter numbers yet, but we couldn't be more impressed with the response in numbers and the nature of the response is first how people are feeling about Harley-Davidson's investment in our veterans."

And we expected this as we entered into the quarter. We're contin",575,"Thanks, Tim. So Touring shipments, Tim, what you're referring to is the shipment slide. When we look at percent of total, Street was basically up 4 percentage points and Touring was down 4. And we expected this as we entered into the quarter. We're continuing to grow our shipments of Street as we fulfill the international rollout and when everything adds up to 100, something's got to come down and when we look, Touring is down. And in the previous 4 quarters, we had our Cruiser business down about 6 percentage points, and certainly there's a lot of concern with regards to that. But whenever we're looking at the total and we're investing in different parts of the business, something's got to come down, one we're very thrilled that we're seeing stability in the Cruiser number in terms of a percent of total. And there are no issues whatsoever with Touring. It's just that as one goes up, somethings got to come down. I will say that actually Touring is  doing -- continues to do very strong. We mentioned that we lapped a 31% increase on the year-ago numbers and our Rushmore sales were still up on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So we're very pleased with that business. The second question that you had, Tim, is Canada. So in early August, we expect stepping in the shoes of our distributor in Canada. Again, we would expect from the overall transaction, what's going to happen is we will receive a little bit more revenue, and that is the margin that we pay and have paid our distributor in Canada will go away and will distribute directly to our dealers in Canada. So we'll see a tiny bit more revenue, not going to be able to see it -- won't be a big impact to the whole thing but certainly from a Canada perspective. And then the second piece of it is that we would also assume expenses for running that market. So SG&A will increase in the third quarter and ongoing. Now when we net the higher revenue and the SG&A out over time, that will be beneficial. We'll have more revenue than SG&A, and therefore the transaction will be accretive into the future. However, in the short-term, as we transition, there's various things that we need to do from a people's standpoint, a systems standpoint, a logistics standpoint to step into those shoes and we do expect in the near term for it to be a cost of about $0.04 per share. And again, by the nature of the one we get into this, most of this would happen in terms of the third quarter and in terms of higher SG&A spending. And your final question, Tim, was with regards to HDFS and the finance promotions that were in the second quarter. When we look at it, the biggest drivers of those promotions on HDFS were really to originations which were up 7% and the receivables that were up 5%. When we look at the income, which again had a very strong quarter HDFS up 10%, very little of that, if any, is captured in this. Remember, these are 60-month loans. They really got in the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June. So you're picking up maybe 160th [ph] of that loan. So very little, if any, impact in terms of the overall financial performance is due to that activity in the second quarter."

I understand the rationale for trying to balance out some of the production to get better absorption in the fourth quarter but if retail seasonality doesn't change, how do you not end up with a higher inventory situation? That is the first question. The second question is can you just go over the net interest margin [indiscernible] in the quarter? It was up but volumes were down. And I don't think spreads are getting better. So is there a mix impact there? Or was it related you said on the question prior which is up there was not much of impact in the prior quarter in the shipments results this quarter?"

The first question is very simple, we would expect Q3 inventories to be down more than they would have been. And Q4 inventories will end up similar to what we always expected, so we'll balance some of that with just lower inventories going into the fourth quarter retail inventories. The second question, Joe, is with regards to HDFS results. We are continuing to see attractive spreads in our business there. If you look at the bridge there, you're seeing that net interest income is up, I believe, it was $4.6 million, and that was due to higher receivables, offset by a little bit of lower spreads on the competition and we've seen that for the last 4 quarters. What we are not seeing, the 0.99 [ph] loans that we have in the marketplace playing out in that and as we go forward, we will see a contraction in spreads as some of those loans move through. Now some of loans are also submitted by the motor company, so there's not HDFS is not going to feel the full impact of that. We do very little intervention between companies. I don't think 2012 or 2013 we did any. Last year we did some because of the excess inventory due to the weather, it was about 3% of the overall loans. So we will see a little bit of tightening of spreads as those loans move through the portfolio, but we're not seeing any of it in the second quarter. And again, overall, we feel very good about the business at HDFS and hopefully everyone caught the fact that we've changed guidance to be down modestly on a year-over-year basis, to be up modestly year-over-year basis and the team at HDFS has done an absolutely fantastic job managing that business."

So the pricing was -- we typically take pricing at model year, so the bulk of that $19 million you're seeing on the bridge is from pricing that we took last August. Over the last several years, we've been taking pricing with the exception of the Rushmore year, but net pricing in excess of cost is about half a percentage point for the last several years and that's what you're seeing in that $19 million. Last year, August, pricing increased revenue by about 1 percentage point, cost of goods sold increased by about 0.5 percentage point and gross margin was up about 0.5 point. So that is simply playing out. Now interim, we did take a little bit of pricing in Europe. Not that much to drive that $19 million, but we raised prices in Europe I believe in late March by 1.2 percentage points and that helped mitigate some of the currency actions that we saw. The bulk of what you're seeing is done a year ago and again, we will look to -- we'll provide the market, you guys, with what our pricing looks like for model year 2016 on August 24."

And that's the biggest change that we see at this point. We'll continue to monitor it and otherwise, shouldn't be any big change. The second question is with regards to used bike pricing. So in the first half of this year within our dealer network, and as we talked before, very difficult to really put your finger on used bike pricing, right. There's 40 years or so models, they span over a 10 year period of time, there's all kinds of customization, different levels of customization within models. So it's not an easy thing really to ferret out. But the best that we can tell within our dealer network in the first half is that used bike prices are stable. Within that, we are seeing used bike prices firm up a little bit in Touring, largely flat in Sportsters and down slightly in our large Cruisers and Dynas and Sports Dynas and Softails.

As a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson tea",1012,"Thanks, Amy, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As you know, this is my first earnings call as President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, but this is far from my first earnings cycle here. As a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson team, I'm not only incredibly proud of where this company's been, I'm incredibly excited about where we're going. You've all read the headlines and results in the news release this morning; sales shipments and earnings are in line with our expectations. As always, John will go into the detailed financials behind that in a few minutes. But first, I want to take a second and talk about the big picture of the quarter, the environment we're in and why I'm encouraged about both our performance and our prospects. 
In April, we acknowledged the environment was going to be difficult in the face of currency and discounting by competitors, but we didn't sit on our hands. We leveraged our strengths, pulled together as a team and came to the table to compete and win. The tough call in April to take down shipments was the right call and reflects our long-standing commitment to manage supply in line with demand. The fact that we delivered shipments in line with that guidance in the second quarter, while maintaining near-record gross margin, shows the strength and flexibility we've built on the operations side of the business. 
But of equal or greater importance in my mind is our commitment to drive demand, and do so in ways that are reinforcing of our premium brand. Harley-Davidson has powerful fundamental strengths and assets and we leveraged some of the many competitive advantages we have like HDFS, our Riding Academy, our richly iconic brand and our great dealer network to drive demand in the quarter. For example, in the U.S., we implemented targeted financing offers through HDFS and we rolled out free rider training to active and veteran military personnel through our Riding Academy. The outstanding response to the Riding Academy program reflects its power and potential as a conduit to the sport through our brand, our retail channel and through great products like the Street, which we use in support of Riding Academy training. 
We believe that taken together, our actions to drive demand had a positive impact on retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increasing momentum in the U.S. with near double-digit growth in June's retail sales of new Harleys. In fact, it was our strongest June retail motorcycle sales in the United States since 2008. In Europe, we also stepped up our marketing efforts and saw growth in new motorcycle sales return in June. At the same time, sales of new Harleys in the Asia Pacific region were up strongly in the quarter, driven in part by the great reception to our Street motorcycles, in particular in China and India. 
In fact, the Harley Davidson Street 750 was the best-selling new Harley ever in the region when it comes to first year sales. Street has also been very successful in bringing new riders into the Harley-Davidson brand both in the U.S. and internationally. In its initial year alone, 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street motorcycles in the United States, all those customers were new to the brand. In EMEA, it was 9 out of 10. And in India, nearly all Street customers were new to our brand. We believe this success underscores the large untapped potential in our business, not to mention what happens when we deliver for customers with great products like Street and we will continue to aggressively tap that potential. 
During the second quarter, we also demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns when we announced our intent to leverage the current environment and our strong balance sheet to increase share repurchases. This decision was driven by what we believe to be a favorable credit environment and our current share price which we believe is inordinately influenced by near-term headwinds, including currency exchange rates. On the operations side, we plan to close on a preannounced transaction with our Canadian distributor in early August and transition to direct distribution in Canada. We have a strong team in place and look forward to all the opportunities and efficiencies we expect to create in that market. 
Looking ahead, we're excited about the 2016 model year motorcycle launch and bringing our global dealer network together for our annual dealer meeting in late August. The dealer meeting is always a highlight of my year because it's a time when we come together, align and share in the mutual pride of being in Harley-Davidson motorcycle business and inspire and motivate the best dealers in the industry. 
Before I turn it over to John, I want to reiterate how proud I am of this company, this team and all of the work that's being done at Harley-Davidson each and every day. Every quarter and every year will have challenges. But we can probably all agree the second quarter retail numbers were not as good as we'd all like, we're energized by the challenges and the competition. Headwinds like these are nothing we haven't seen before in our 112 years. We see them as catalysts for getting stronger, and we are. 
Make no mistake, driving demand and growing the business are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson, even as we address the near-term market condition, our eyes and our energy are clearly focused on our strategies for growth and continued industry leadership, long term. These strategies include rolling out great new products, growing sales to U.S. outreach customers faster than to core, bringing increasing numbers of new customers into the brand internationally and taking the Harley-Davidson retail experience to new heights, all in ways aimed to make Harley-Davidson the most customer-led company in the world. We're confident in the strength of our business, our strategies and our team. We're strong in our leadership position, we're managing the business for the long term and we're here to win. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on Slide 10. Results were in line with our expectations given lower shipmen",927,"Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on Slide 10. Results were in line with our expectations given lower shipments in the quarter following the shipment guidance reduction we took in April. During the quarter, revenue was $1.82 billion, net income was $299.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, all down on lower shipments and ongoing pressure from unfavorable currency exchange. 
As expected, operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down 19.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Motorcycles segment operating performance continues to be very strong when considering the lower volumes and unfavorable currency impact. The Motorcycle business operating margin was down 2.7 percentage points driven by higher SG&A spending and lower revenues, while gross margin remained very strong at 39.2%.  At HDFS, operating income was up 10.0% year-over-year. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a closer look at Q2 performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. As we continue to face a very challenging retail environment in many markets worldwide, retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the second quarter. In the U.S., retail sales were down 0.7% as we continue to experience pressure from foreign exchange driven discounting by other brands and as we lapped last year's strong Rushmore sales. Internationally, retail sales were mainly impacted by new low-priced models from competitors in Europe, currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell in non-local currencies and challenging economic conditions in some markets. 
As we exited the second quarter, our business remains under pressure from increased competitive activity, including aggressive price discounting in the U.S., enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. We have taken action around the world in a manner which will reinforce our brand premium. We are very pleased that our market actions helped drive very strong sales results in the month of June. We remain confident in our worldwide motorcycle shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% for the full year. We expect second half retail sales growth to be driven by our continued demand driving market actions that we've initiated in various world markets, the continued worldwide rollout of our Street motorcycles, ongoing international dealer expansion, the introduction of our 2016 model year motorcycles in late August and our ongoing brand strength. We remain focused on delivering the Harley-Davidson customer experience to riders around the world. We expect to grow the appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, expand international sales and increase sales to outreach customers in the U.S. We are confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 12. Second quarter retail sales were down 0.7% in the U.S. Excluding the fleet of Street motorcycles for rider training registered by dealers during last year's second quarter, sales would have been up 2.1% year-over-year. We believe the factors that were underlying U.S. retail sales results during the quarter were: first, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q2 24 [ph] retail sales of Touring models were up a very strong 31% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q2 2015. Second, we experienced continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition. Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success in our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street motorcycles sales continue to drive our performance in small cruisers, which grew double digits year-over-year. 
To counter the competitive environment in the U.S. market, we've initiated a three-pronged market action plan which includes lifestyle and brand advertising and marketing, targeted finance offers and leveraging H-D's others competitive advantages such as Riding Academy and our dealer network. The bulk of these market-driving actions were introduced in late May through mid-June. While it is still early, we believe these activities are having a positive impact on our retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increased momentum resulting in near double-digit growth in June's retail sales. 
Turning to market share, during the quarter, U.S. industry grew at 6.8%. We had a very strong market leadership share of 47.5% and believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter bodes well for motorcycling. However, our Q2 market share was down 2.8 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last 3 quarters was more severely impacted than we had expected as a result of increased price discounting by the competition and inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. We are pleased to see a moderation in market share loss from the first quarter decline of 4.7 percentage points, and believe the improvement is driven by strong brand strategy and recent market share actions to drive demand in this tough competitive environment. 
This is not the first time we've experienced a period of extreme discounting by competitors, and likely it won't be the last. However, we will protect our brand premium. We will not take a short-term view and compete with brand damaging discounting, nor will we ship out-of-balance with retail demand. We continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long term. At the end of the second quarter, U.S. retail sales was down approximately 1,600 motorcycles on a year-over-year basis..."

Excluding incremental retail dealer fill of Street motorcycles, Q2 retail inventory was down significantly as expected. We were very pleased with inventory levels",2226,"Our U.S. retail inventory was down approximately 1,600 motorcycle on a year-over-year basis. Excluding incremental retail dealer fill of Street motorcycles, Q2 retail inventory was down significantly as expected. We were very pleased with inventory levels at the end of Q2. This reflects the benefits of our flexible manufacturing capability and our commitment to manage supply in line with demand. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.7% in the second quarter. We initiated market actions to counter increase competitive activities and weak economic trends in certain international markets. Similar to the U.S., we initiated these activities in mid-to-late second quarter, and we were very encouraged by June's retail sales results. 
In the EMEA region, retail sales were down as the region experienced the impact of several low-priced models introduced by competitive brands and lapped strong year-ago retail sales of 7.0%. In addition, we experienced currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in non-local currencies, such as in Russia. Year-to-date market -- year-to-date Europe market share was 10.2%, down 1.9 percentage points behind the impact of low-priced models introduced by the competition in the performance and standard segments, market segments where Harley-Davidson's motorcycles do not compete. 
In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were up 16.6% in the quarter. The region experienced growth in all major markets, and in particular in our emerging markets led by India and China. Driving these results is The Street motorcycle, which launched in many Asia Pacific markets in the first half of 2015. Street makes entry into the Harley-Davidson brand more attainable for riders around the world, and the early results are very exciting. Retail sales in Japan were up, and they were impacted by the restructuring of distribution in that market, including a new pipeline distribution process and rationalizing the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience. 
Latin America region retail sales were down modestly in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil, largely offset by strong growth in Mexico. Retail sales in Brazil continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were down behind a highly competitive environment coinciding with the transition of the business from a distributor to direct distribution. While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are confident in our current market efforts and remain focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were down 7.6% compared to last year and within our expected range of 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles. The overall shipment makes -- reflects higher concentration of Street, as we continue the global rollout of these models. As we exited Q2 2015, we believe U.S. retail inventories in the dealer network were at appropriate levels. Q2 2015 international shipments were 35.3% of total shipments. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles segment was down in Q2 compared to last year driven by 7.6% lower motorcycle shipments and unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 4.6%. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $692 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Parts and accessories revenue fell 5.4% driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. General Merchandise revenue was up 1.5% driven by robust international growth, largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.2%, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange and lower volumes. During the quarter, overall mix was unfavorable $16.5 million, largely driven by family mix, which included a higher mix of Street motorcycles and a lower mix of Touring motorcycles. Foreign currency exchange was $36.1 million unfavorable for the second quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies. Key currencies devalued an average of 19% compared to the prior-year quarter. 
Our Q2 2015 gross margin, as a percent of revenue, exceeded our expectations as foreign currency exchange came in better-than-expected behind some strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates within the quarter and better-than-expected manufacturing productivity. Our Q2 2015 gross margin of 39.2% is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 23.1%, down 2.7 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to increased marketing investment as we address the highly competitive environment. Also, SG&A expenses in the quarter included recall reserves of $16.4 million, which included a voluntary recall in Touring motorcycles that we incurred late in the quarter. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. HDFS has a strategic competitive advantage for Harley-Davidson. It enables wholesale and retail sales of our Harley-Davidson motorcycles and delivers attractive returns for the company. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased 10.0% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Also, HDFS had increase in insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the second quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business continued to be very profitable with industry-leading returns. 
HDFS' second quarter operations are summarized on Slide 19. HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 7.0% compared to last year's second quarter, primarily driven by a 6.8 percentage point increase in our U.S. retail finance market share and higher average amount financed per motorcycle. Finance receivables outstanding increased 5.0% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in the retail portfolio. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company. At the end of the quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.84 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. Finally, during the second quarter, we successfully completed a $500 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.16%. 
Credit performance tracked very well during the quarter. On Slide 20, you will see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at June 30, 2015, was 2.71% or 3 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels. Annual credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.08% compared to last year's second quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime originations in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior. During the second quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
The Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $613.9 million in the first half of this year. Operating cash was up $43.4 million from last year, driven by lower net wholesale lending, partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 22, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share and we repurchased 2.8 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $164.8 million. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
To that end, on Slide 23, you'll see that last month, we announced our plan to add debt to the corporate balance sheet in order to enhance our share repurchase efforts and deliver additional value to our shareholders. On June 17, we announced that we plan to incur $750 million of long-term debt, with the intent to use the funds to repurchase shares of the company's stock. We expect to incur the debt in the next couple of weeks and complete the share repurchases by the end of this year. The repurchases will be an addition to our ongoing share repurchase plan, which we expect to be in line with last year's second half repurchases of $392 million. We believe this recapitalization is a great opportunity to increase our long-term shareholders ownership in the company, without an adverse impact to the long-term value of the brand or the business. 
Our guidance is on Slide 24. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles. Given our first half results, we have a challenging back half to achieve our shipment guidance. We are confident that we are taking appropriate market actions to accelerate growth in the back half, without participating in brand damaging motorcycle discounting. During the third quarter, we expect to ship 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 6.5% to 16.5% compared to last year's third quarter shipments. For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the Motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we now expect gross margin to be up modestly compared to 2014 impacted by both puts and takes. 
On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin to be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange and increased pension expense. To dimentionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 3/4 of a percent. 
For the third quarter, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates, we expect revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5% with about 40% of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the quarter, reducing gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. We now expect SG&A spending will be up modestly in 2015, both in absolute spending and as a percent of revenue, due to the recall expenses and investment in market-driving activities. For HDFS, we now expect operating income to be up modestly in 2015 compared to 2014. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2015 to be between $240 million, $260 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. 
Finally, we continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. This guidance does not include the impact of the anticipated Canadian distributor transaction. We expect the financial impact to be dilutive in 2015 to earnings per share by approximately $0.04 behind upfront transition costs. This impact would be realized largely in the third quarter. 
So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant competitive pressures around the world, we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the second quarter. We successfully maintained a strong gross margin percent despite lower volumes and unfavorable currency exchange, implemented market driving actions which drove June retail sales, expanded distribution of Street in the new international markets and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of 165 million in company shares and announced a $0.75 billion recapitalization. 
For the second half of 2015, we will navigate a challenging business environment. We remain confident in our shipment guidance and the actions we are taking to support retail sales in the second half of the year. We will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

So 2 pieces -- let's separate 2 pieces of the first question as retail and shipments. So retail sales were down 1.4% in the first half, and we are expecting retail sales certainly to accelerate in the back half of the year that supports our shipment guidance, which is up 2 to 4 percentage points. But shifting to the specific question, Felicia, on shipments, if we look at overall shipments in the first half of this year, we are -- we're down 4.7% in shipments. And as you looked at kind of year-to-date year to go, it would hit that 2.4 -- 2% to 4% shipment growth guidance, we would need our shipments to be up in the back half of 14% to 19%. So let's start out with the half and then we'll get into the 2 quarters in the back half. The reason that we're looking to ship more in the back half of the year is not really related to retail sales, it's related to what happened last year. Felicia, if you remember last year, we had a very terrible, very tough weather in the United States. And consequently, we ended up shipping in more motorcycles in the first half than retail sales warranted. And then we spent the second half taking production and shipments out of the back half to get inventories back in line. Consequently, last year, at the end of the second quarter, our retail inventories were up too high and resulted in more carryover units than we would have liked. So again, our focus is always on aggressively managing supply in line with demand and making sure we're adequately supplying the market. So what we did this year is just to reverse out what happened last year. So we shipped in less this year than we retailed in order to bring down second quarter retail inventories this year. And we couldn't be happier as to where we're at. As we had mentioned, we're down 1,600 units. But when you adjust out the Street motorcycles, inventories are down significantly in line with where we believe we need to be to have a very smooth transition into the new model year 2016 motorcycles. And consequently, because we were down so much in last year's second half in shipments, we will become coincidingly up 14% to 19%. Now what you've done is taken our shipment guidance of 54,000 to 59,000 in the third quarter. And seeing that overall shipment, that suggested shipments will be higher in the fourth quarter and that is true. And so now when we look at the back half of those 2 quarters, we are moving production from the first part of the year to the fourth quarter. And the reason being is we become very good at flexible manufacturing. And we have matched up our production with our demand very well, given the manufacturing system that we have. But as we looked at last year, that required a fair amount of down days in the fourth quarter and probably hurt efficiencies a little bit. So what we want to do is balance out production a little bit in the back half of the year between the third and fourth quarters. That will have a little bit of  a headwind in terms of gross margin between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But on aggregate, it won't have an impact. So again, we're smoothing out production a little bit, that's translating into a little bit more shipments in the fourth quarter. The second question that you asked is the cadence in second quarter retail sales. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've got a three-pronged approach to addressing the competitiveness. And we're addressing that in a Harley-Davidson's way, which is not price discounting. We've talked about this the last time, we will not meet discounting with discounting, we will not put hangtags on our motorcycles. That is certainly the easiest way to address some of the competitiveness we're experiencing in the United States. So with this three-pronged approach, most of those activities got into the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June, and we have seen very strong results coming from that. And so in April and May, retail sales were pretty soft, softer than what we saw in the first quarter. However, June, we built a very strong momentum and we're up near double digits in the United States, as well as near double digit in international markets behind the investments that we've made to kind of close that competitive gap."

Again, the bulk of that we're seeing in the shipment cadence and shipping more in the second half than the first half, is to correct last year's shipping patterns that were disrupted by the unfavorable weather. Clearly, as we look at our production, as well as our shipments, we're taking into account various market activities, certainly our new products that are coming out, and so all of that is considered. But the biggest driver in the splits of being down in the first half to up in the second half is really what happened last year and getting those inventories in line. When we talk about inventory growth, I would assume, Craig, that you're referring to at the end of the year. We expect and continue to expect inventory at the end of the year to be flat to up modestly, and that does take into account the various models that we have in the marketplace. And I'm sorry -- thank you, Amy. That is -- that answer is with regards to the United States, that we expect it to be flat to up modestly. Internationally, we do expect inventories to rise as we add new dealer points. And we're continuing on a similar pattern of adding dealers that we were in previous years. Actually, in the quarter, we added 11 new dealers which we're very thrilled about. So with that, internationally, we will be putting more inventory to support that growth."

And I think about those trends going forward, which do you expect to get better and when does your guidance assume that those share losses that you've seen in the first half of the year flatten out or maybe even flip into it, a share gain as we think about third and fourth quarters of this year?"

The first question, industry growth and our retail, so what we have said is that we expect flat to modestly up growth, and that is tied to basically holding terms flat. However, when we look at that, number one is we are expecting retail growth in the back half, and we're certainly expecting to support our shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% withholding those inventories at year end in the United States. And we're also looking -- when we talk about inventory, we're looking at forward turns and what we expect to sell into the future as well. The second question that you had, James, is with regards to market trends. Why don't we start out with the first half. We have had a tough half, largely driven by the price discounting, but overall market share was down 3.5 percentage points. The bulk of that share loss is due to price competition in the marketplace. The second biggest driver of the market share loss in the first half was the inclusion of autocycles in the motorcycle industry numbers. And these are -- a vehicle that's included, that is very car-like, it's got side-by-side seating, gas pedal and breaks, steering wheel, very large front end, it just happens to have a single wheel in the back. States are having trouble figuring out what it is in terms of it is a motorcycle, is it registrable, is it an autocycle. But in any event, we do not believe that it competes directly with traditional motorcycles, but it is having a large impact on our overall market share because we're 50% of the market. So those are the 2 largest drivers of market share losses. As we move forward, we expect certainly our share losses to mitigate. We saw that in the quarter. If you look within the quarter, we kind of talked about the retail sales cadence within the quarter which improved very much in the previous question. But market share as well improved significantly in the quarter as we got some of our market response actions out. So as we move forward, we would expect market shares to temper, especially in the fourth quarter when we start to lap the initial impact of the price discounting."

We would expect revenues to be down 5% and the impact on gross margin in the third quarter to about 1 full percentage point headwind. And the other piece that we had mentioned when we were talking about shipment and production cadence, we are moving more production into the fourth quarter, and that will have an impact of moving a little bit of gross margin out of the previous quarters into the fourth quarter. So that will provide a little bit of a headwind in terms of gross margin in third quarter as well.

We're reporting results as of the end of the second quarter and we're not going to go beyond that. But again, what we saw in the first quarter and the change in shift and momentum, we feel very good about our overall second half. The second question is with regards to what we had talked about in addressing some of the competitive issues. We've got a three-pronged approach, and you can see most notably in there is brand damaging discounting is not a part of it. So we're very pleased with what we've got. It's not as easy, it's not as quick. We've got to be a lot more creative in how we do it, and the results are very strong. But when we look at the various pieces, they all work in concert with each other, right? When you look at the lifestyle and brand advertising, that's an investment in the future, an investment in the brand and the brand premium. Hard to measure what that does on a day-to-day basis. The second piece of it is targeted finance offers that is trying to close some of the competitive gap that we have in the marketplace. We haven't talked much about discounting, but it certainly has not improved on a quarter-over-quarter business. It remains consistent to a little bit increase. We're seeing a couple more competitors and we're also seeing the level go up a little bit. Now the top discount out there is $4,000 a motorcycle. So the targeted finance offers are just that very targeted and they allow us to work on some of that price gap. I will also say that being able to do this with HDFS is absolutely a fantastic benefit and advantage to us. We've immediately got over 700 dealers in the United States, we can access some -- we can offer the same thing, and we can get execution very pristine across the U.S. And certainly, HDFS is proving to be a tremendous advantage. And then the last piece is really leveraging some of our competitive advantages, things that we have that no one else does. First and foremost is the dealer network and getting their focus where we needed to be. And then the second, our assets such as Rider Academy. And so a program like this, and Matt had mentioned it in his prepared remarks, is we've offered free rider training to all veteran and active military folks. And this is an incredibly brand enhancing opportunity for us and it comes at a very efficient price. So we're not seeing the benefits of that in the first half. We launched that in the middle of May and we've seen overwhelming response, of interest. And what's going to take these folks to get enrolled in Riding Academy, complete the course and then purchase a motorcycle. So this is something that's going to drive more in the second half, certainly, than it did in the first half. And it will be a very strong brand enhancing point with about 1/3 of our customers that buy new motorcycles at any given year."

I think the Rider Academy veterans program is a great example of the kind of great work that we're doing internally to do smart things to grow the business long term. As John mentioned, practically none of that investment is in the second quarter numbers yet, but we couldn't be more impressed with the response in numbers and the nature of the response as far as how people are feeling about Harley-Davidson's investment in our veterans."

When we look at percent of total, Street was basically up 4 percentage points and Touring was down 4. And we expected this as we entered into the quarter. We're continuing to grow our shipments of Street as we fulfill the international rollout. And when everything adds up to 100, something's got to come down and when we look, Touring is down. And the previous 4 quarters, we had our Cruiser business down about 6 percentage points, and certainly there was a lot of concern with regards to that. But whenever we're looking at the total and we're investing in different parts of the business, something's got to come down. One, we're very thrilled that we're seeing stability in the Cruiser number in terms of percent of total. And there are no issues whatsoever with Touring, it's just that as one goes up, something has got to come down. And I will say that actually Touring is  doing -- continues to do very strong. We had mentioned that we lapped a 31% increase on the year-ago numbers and our Rushmore sales were still up on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So we're very pleased with that business. The second question that you had, Tim, is Canada. So in early August, we expect to step into the shoes of our distributor in Canada. Again, we would expect from the overall transaction, what's going to happen is that we will receive a little bit more revenue, and that is the margin that we pay and have paid our distributor in Canada will go away and we'll distribute directly to our dealers in Canada. So we'll see a tiny bit more revenue, we're not going to be able to see it on a -- it won't be a big impact to the whole thing but certainly from a Canada perspective. And then the second piece of it is that we will also assume the expenses for running that market. So SG&A will increase in the third quarter and ongoing. Now when we net the higher revenue and the SG&A out over time, that will be beneficial. We'll have more revenue than SG&A, and therefore the transaction will be accretive into the future. However, in the short term, as we transition, there's various things that we need to do from a people's standpoint, a systems standpoint, a logistics standpoint to step into those shoes, and we do expect in the near term for it to be a cost of about $0.04 per share. And again, by the nature of the one we get into this, most of that will happen in the terms -- in terms of the third quarter and in terms of higher SG&A spending. And your final question, Tim, was with regards to HDFS and the finance promotions that were in the second quarter. When we look at the biggest drivers of those promotions on HDFS were really to originations, which were up 7% and the receivables that were up 5%. When we look at the income, which again had a very strong quarter at HDFS up 10%, very little of that, if any, is captured in this. Remember, these are 60-month loans. They really got in the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June. So you're picking up maybe 1/60 of that loan. So very little, if any, impact in terms of the overall financial performance is due to that activity in the second quarter."

It was the first question, the second question is, the -- can you just go over the net interest margin at HDFS in the quarter? It was up but volumes were down, and I don't think spreads are getting better. So is there some mix impact there?

And Q4 inventories will end up similar to where we always expect it. So we'll balance some of that with just lower inventories going into the fourth quarter, retail inventories. The second question, Joe, is with regards to HDFS results. We are continuing to see attractive spreads in our business there. If you look at the bridge there, you're seeing that net interest income is up, I believe, it was $4.6 million. And that was due to higher receivables, offset by a little bit of lower spreads on -- to the competition, and we've seen that for the last 4 quarters. What we are not seeing, the 0.99 loans that we have in the marketplace playing out in that. And as we go forward, we will see a contraction in spreads as some of those loans move through. Now some of those loans are also subvented by the motor company, so there's not -- HDFS is not going to feel the full impact of that. We do very little subvention between companies. I don't think 2012 or 2013 we did any. Last year we did some because of the excess inventory due to the weather, I think it amounted about 3% of the overall loans. So we will see a little bit of tightening of spreads as those loans move through the portfolio, but we're not seeing any of it in the second quarter. And again, overall, we feel very good about the business at HDFS. And hopefully, everyone caught the fact that we've changed our guidance to be down modestly on a year-over-year basis, to be up modestly year-over-year basis. And the team at HDFS have done an absolutely fantastic job managing that business."

So the pricing where -- we typically take pricing at model year, so the bulk of that $19 million you're seeing on the bridge is from pricing that we took last August. Over the last several years, we've been taking pricing with the exception of the Rushmore year, but net pricing in excess of cost has been about 0.5 percentage point for the last several years, and that's what you're seeing in that $19 million. Last year, August, pricing increased revenue by about 1 percentage point, cost of goods sold increased by about 0.5 percentage point and gross margin was up about 0.5 point. So that is simply playing out. Now interim, we did take a little bit of pricing in Europe. Not that much to drive that $19 million, but we raised prices in Europe, I believe, in late March by 1.2 percentage points and that was to help mitigate some of the currency actions that we saw. But the bulk of what you're seeing was done a year ago. And again, we will look to provide the market and you guys with what our pricing looks like for model year 2016 on August 24."

So we fall within that jurisdiction. So we've always been regulated by the FDIC and others, so now we will add on CFPB to folks that provide oversight to us. And that's the biggest change that we see at this point. We'll continue to monitor it. Otherwise, there shouldn't be any big change. The second question is with regards to used bike pricing. So in the first half of this year within our dealer network, and as we've talked before, very difficult to really put your finger on used bike pricing, right? There's 40-or-so models, they span over a 10-year period of time, there's all kinds of customization, different levels of customization within models. So it's not an easy thing, really, to fair it out. But the best that we can tell within our dealer network in the first half is that used bike prices are stable. Now within that, we're seeing used bike prices firm up a little bit in Touring, largely flat in Sportsters and down slightly in our large Cruisers and Dynas and Sports -- on Dynas and Softails.

As you know, this is my first earnings call as President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, but this is far from my first earnings cycle here. And as a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson",1013,"Thanks, Amy, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As you know, this is my first earnings call as President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, but this is far from my first earnings cycle here. And as a longtime member of the Harley-Davidson team, I'm not only incredibly proud of where this company's been, I'm incredibly excited about where we're going. You've all read the headlines and results in the news release this morning; sales shipments and earnings are in line with our expectations. As always, John will go into the detailed financials behind that in a few minutes. But first, I want to take a second and talk about the big picture of the quarter, the environment we're in and why I'm encouraged about both our performance and our prospects. 
In April, we acknowledged the environment was going to be difficult in the face of currency and discounting by competitors, but we didn't sit on our hands. We leveraged our strengths, pulled together as a team and came to the table to compete and win. The tough call in April to take down shipments was the right call and reflects our long-standing commitment to manage supply in line with demand. The fact that we delivered shipments in line with that guidance in the second quarter, while maintaining near-record gross margin, shows the strength and flexibility we've built on the operations side of the business. 
But of equal or greater importance in my mind is our commitment to drive demand, and do so in ways that are reinforcing of our premium brand. Harley-Davidson has powerful fundamental strengths and assets and we leveraged some of the many competitive advantages we have like HDFS, our Riding Academy, our richly iconic brand and our great dealer network to drive demand in the quarter. For example, in the U.S., we implemented targeted financing offers through HDFS and we rolled out free rider training to active and veteran military personnel through our Riding Academy. The outstanding response to the Riding Academy program reflects its power and potential as a conduit to the sport through our brand, our retail channel and through great products like the Street, which we use in support of Riding Academy training. 
We believe that taken together, our actions to drive demand had a positive impact on retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increasing momentum in the U.S. with near double-digit growth in June's retail sales of new Harleys. In fact, it was our strongest June retail motorcycle sales in the United States since 2008. In Europe, we also stepped up our marketing efforts and saw growth in new motorcycle sales return in June. At the same time, sales of new Harleys in the Asia Pacific region were up strongly in the quarter, driven in part by the great reception to our Street motorcycles, in particular in China and India. 
In fact, the Harley Davidson Street 750 was the best-selling new Harley ever in the region when it comes to first year sales. Street has also been very successful in bringing new riders into the Harley-Davidson brand both in the U.S. and internationally. In its initial year alone, 7 out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street motorcycles in the United States, all those customers were new to the brand. In EMEA, it was 9 out of 10. And in India, nearly all Street customers were new to our brand. We believe this success underscores the large untapped potential in our business, not to mention what happens when we deliver for customers with great products like Street and we will continue to aggressively tap that potential. 
During the second quarter, we also demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns when we announced our intent to leverage the current environment and our strong balance sheet to increase share repurchases. This decision was driven by what we believe to be a favorable credit environment and our current share price which we believe is inordinately influenced by near-term headwinds, including currency exchange rates. On the operations side, we plan to close on a preannounced transaction with our Canadian distributor in early August and transition to direct distribution in Canada. We have a strong team in place and look forward to all the opportunities and efficiencies we expect to create in that market. 
Looking ahead, we're excited about the 2016 model year motorcycle launch and bringing our global dealer network together for our annual dealer meeting in late August. The dealer meeting is always a highlight of my year because it's a time when we come together, align and share in the mutual pride of being in Harley-Davidson motorcycle business and inspire and motivate the best dealers in the industry. 
Before I turn it over to John, I want to reiterate how proud I am of this company, this team and all of the work that's being done at Harley-Davidson each and every day. Every quarter and every year will have challenges. While we can probably all agree the second quarter retail numbers were not as good as we'd all like, we're energized by the challenges and the competition. Headwinds like these are nothing we haven't seen before in our 112 years. We see them as catalysts for getting stronger, and we are. 
Make no mistake, driving demand and growing the business are top priorities for all of us at Harley-Davidson, even as we address the near-term market condition, our eyes and our energy are clearly focused on our strategies for growth and continued industry leadership, long term. These strategies include rolling out great new products, growing sales to U.S. outreach customers faster than to core, bringing increasing numbers of new customers into the brand internationally and taking the Harley-Davidson retail experience to new heights, all in ways aimed to make Harley-Davidson the most customer-led company in the world. We're confident in the strength of our business, our strategies and our team. We're strong in our leadership position, we're managing the business for the long term and we're here to win. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John."

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on Slide 10. Results were in line with our expectations given lower shipmen",927,"Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results found in the press release and slides. The summary of our second quarter financial results starts on Slide 10. Results were in line with our expectations given lower shipments in the quarter following the shipment guidance reduction we took in April. During the quarter, revenue was $1.82 billion, net income was $299.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, all down on lower shipments and ongoing pressure from unfavorable currency exchange. 
As expected, operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down 19.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Motorcycles segment operating performance continues to be very strong when considering the lower volumes and unfavorable currency impact. The Motorcycle business operating margin was down 2.7 percentage points driven by higher SG&A spending and lower revenues, while gross margin remained very strong at 39.2%.  At HDFS, operating income was up 10.0% year-over-year. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's take a closer look at Q2 performance starting with retail sales on Slide 11. As we continue to face a very challenging retail environment in many markets worldwide, retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the second quarter. In the U.S., retail sales were down 0.7% as we continue to experience pressure from foreign exchange driven discounting by other brands and as we lapped last year's strong Rushmore sales. Internationally, retail sales were mainly impacted by new low-priced models from competitors in Europe, currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell in non-local currencies and challenging economic conditions in some markets. 
As we exited the second quarter, our business remains under pressure from increased competitive activity, including aggressive price discounting in the U.S., enabled by the dramatic shift in world currencies. We have taken action around the world in a manner which will reinforce our brand premium. We are very pleased that our market actions helped drive very strong sales results in the month of June. We remain confident in our worldwide motorcycle shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% for the full year. We expect second half retail sales growth to be driven by our continued demand driving market actions that we've initiated in various world markets, the continued worldwide rollout of our Street motorcycles, ongoing international dealer expansion, the introduction of our 2016 model year motorcycles in late August and our ongoing brand strength. We remain focused on delivering the Harley-Davidson customer experience to riders around the world. We expect to grow the appeal of the Harley-Davidson brand, expand international sales and increase sales to outreach customers in the U.S. We are confident in our business and the great opportunities that lie ahead. 
Let's take a look at the U.S. market on Slide 12. Second quarter retail sales were down 0.7% in the U.S. Excluding the fleet of Street motorcycles for rider training registered by dealers during last year's second quarter, sales would have been up 2.1% year-over-year. We believe the factors that were underlying U.S. retail sales results during the quarter were: first, as expected, we lapped the very enthusiastic reception to the initial Rushmore launch. Q2 24 [ph] retail sales of Touring models were up a very strong 31% compared to the prior year, a tough year-over-year comparison for Q2 2015. Second, we experienced continued pressure from significant price discounting by most of the competition. Partially offsetting these challenges, we continue to experience success in our latest Rushmore models launched last August and with sales of our Street motorcycles. Street motorcycles sales continue to drive our performance in small cruisers, which grew double digits year-over-year. 
To counter the competitive environment in the U.S. market, we've initiated a three-pronged market action plan which includes lifestyle and brand advertising and marketing, targeted finance offers and leveraging H-D's others competitive advantages such as Riding Academy and our dealer network. The bulk of these market-driving actions were introduced in late May through mid-June. While it is still early, we believe these activities are having a positive impact on our retail sales. During the quarter, we saw increased momentum resulting in near double-digit growth in June's retail sales. 
Turning to market share, during the quarter, U.S. industry grew at 6.8%. We had a very strong market leadership share of 47.5% and believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter bodes well for motorcycling. However, our Q2 market share was down 2.8 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last 3 quarters was more severely impacted than we had expected as a result of increased price discounting by the competition and inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. We are pleased to see a moderation in market share loss from the first quarter decline of 4.7 percentage points, and believe the improvement is driven by strong brand strategy and recent market share actions to drive demand in this tough competitive environment. 
This is not the first time we've experienced a period of extreme discounting by competitors, and likely it won't be the last. However, we will protect our brand premium. We will not take a short-term view and compete with brand damaging discounting, nor will we ship out-of-balance with retail demand. We continue to manage the Harley-Davidson brand for the long term. At the end of the second quarter, U.S. retail sales was down approximately 1,600 motorcycles on a year-over-year basis..."

Excluding incremental retail dealer fill of Street motorcycles, Q2 retail inventory was down significantly as expected. We were very pleased with inventory levels at the end of Q2. This reflects the benefits of our flexible manufacturing capability and our commitment to manage supply in line with demand. 
On Slide 13, you'll see retail sales in our international markets were down 2.7% in the second quarter. We initiated market actions to counter increase competitive activities and weak economic trends in certain international markets. Similar to the U.S., we initiated these activities in mid-to-late second quarter, and we were very encouraged by June's retail sales results. 
In the EMEA region, retail sales were down as the region experienced the impact of several low-priced models introduced by competitive brands and lapped strong year-ago retail sales of 7.0%. In addition, we experienced currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in non-local currencies, such as in Russia. Year-to-date market -- year-to-date Europe market share was 10.2%, down 1.9 percentage points behind the impact of low-priced models introduced by the competition in the performance and standard segments, market segments where Harley-Davidson's motorcycles do not compete. 
In the Asia Pacific region, retail sales were up 16.6% in the quarter. The region experienced growth in all major markets, and in particular in our emerging markets led by India and China. Driving these results is The Street motorcycle, which launched in many Asia Pacific markets in the first half of 2015. Street makes entry into the Harley-Davidson brand more attainable for riders around the world, and the early results are very exciting. Retail sales in Japan were up, and they were impacted by the restructuring of distribution in that market, including a new pipeline distribution process and rationalizing the dealer network in order to improve the customer experience. 
Latin America region retail sales were down modestly in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil, largely offset by strong growth in Mexico. Retail sales in Brazil continued to be impacted by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and very aggressive price competition. 
Finally, retail sales in Canada were down behind a highly competitive environment coinciding with the transition of the business from a distributor to direct distribution. While we remain cautious in the near-term outlook given the economic challenges in some international markets, we are confident in our current market efforts and remain focused on the long-term growth strategies. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by prudently expanding our distribution network, building our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 14, you'll see wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were down 7.6% compared to last year and within our expected range of 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles. The overall shipment makes -- reflects higher concentration of Street, as we continue the global rollout of these models. As we exited Q2 2015, we believe U.S. retail inventories in the dealer network were at appropriate levels. Q2 2015 international shipments were 35.3% of total shipments. We continue to believe international retail sales will grow at a faster rate than domestic retail sales over the next few years. 
On Slide 15, you'll see revenue for the Motorcycles segment was down in Q2 compared to last year driven by 7.6% lower motorcycle shipments and unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 4.6%. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $692 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Parts and accessories revenue fell 5.4% driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. General Merchandise revenue was up 1.5% driven by robust international growth, largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
On Slide 16, you'll see gross margin in the quarter was 39.2%, which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin performed very well when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange and lower volumes. During the quarter, overall mix was unfavorable $16.5 million, largely driven by family mix, which included a higher mix of Street motorcycles and a lower mix of Touring motorcycles. Foreign currency exchange was $36.1 million unfavorable for the second quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies. Key currencies devalued an average of 19% compared to the prior-year quarter. 
Our Q2 2015 gross margin, as a percent of revenue, exceeded our expectations as foreign currency exchange came in better-than-expected behind some strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates within the quarter and better-than-expected manufacturing productivity. Our Q2 2015 gross margin of 39.2% is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. We remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout our operations. 
On Slide 17, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the second quarter was 23.1%, down 2.7 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to increased marketing investment as we address the highly competitive environment. Also, SG&A expenses in the quarter included recall reserves of $16.4 million, which included a voluntary recall in Touring motorcycles that we incurred late in the quarter. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on a cost structure that will enable growth and continuous improvement to drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 18. HDFS has a strategic competitive advantage for Harley-Davidson. It enables wholesale and retail sales of our Harley-Davidson motorcycles and delivers attractive returns for the company. During the quarter, HDFS' operating profit increased 10.0% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables, partially offset by lower yields on receivables due to increased competition. Also, HDFS had increase in insurance and credit card licensing revenue during the second quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of the Financial Services business. The business continued to be very profitable with industry-leading returns. 
HDFS' second quarter operations are summarized on Slide 19. HDFS' retail motorcycle loan originations increased 7.0% compared to last year's second quarter, primarily driven by a 6.8 percentage point increase in our U.S. retail finance market share and higher average amount financed per motorcycle. Finance receivables outstanding increased 5.0% compared to a year ago, driven by growth in the retail portfolio. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company. At the end of the quarter, we had $419 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had $1.84 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. Finally, during the second quarter, we successfully completed a $500 million asset-backed securitization transaction with a weighted average interest rate of 1.16%. 
Credit performance tracked very well during the quarter. On Slide 20, you will see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at June 30, 2015, was 2.71% or 3 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels. Annual credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.08% compared to last year's second quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime originations in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior. During the second quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
The Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 21. I'd like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $613.9 million in the first half of this year. Operating cash was up $43.4 million from last year, driven by lower net wholesale lending, partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 22, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share and we repurchased 2.8 million shares of Harley-Davidson stock for $164.8 million. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and repurchasing shares. 
To that end, on Slide 23, you'll see that last month, we announced our plan to add debt to the corporate balance sheet in order to enhance our share repurchase efforts and deliver additional value to our shareholders. On June 17, we announced that we plan to incur $750 million of long-term debt, with the intent to use the funds to repurchase shares of the company's stock. We expect to incur the debt in the next couple of weeks and complete the share repurchases by the end of this year. The repurchases will be an addition to our ongoing share repurchase plan, which we expect to be in line with last year's second half repurchases of $392 million. We believe this recapitalization is a great opportunity to increase our long-term shareholders' ownership in the company, without an adverse impact to the long-term value of the brand or the business. 
Our guidance is on Slide 24. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect to ship 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles. Given our first half results, we have a challenging back half to achieve our shipment guidance. We are confident that we are taking appropriate market actions to accelerate growth in the back half, without participating in brand damaging motorcycle discounting. During the third quarter, we expect to ship 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles, which is up approximately 6.5% to 16.5% compared to last year's third quarter shipments. For 2015, we continue to believe operating margin for the Motorcycle segment will be between 18% and 19% compared to 18.0% in 2014. In 2015, we now expect gross margin to be up modestly compared to 2014 impacted by both puts and takes. 
On the positive side, we expect favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin to be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange and increased pension expense. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currencies held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 3/4 of a percent. 
For the third quarter, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates, we expect revenue to be adversely impacted by approximately 5% with about 40% of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the quarter, reducing gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. We now expect SG&A spending will be up modestly in 2015, both in absolute spending and as a percent of revenue, due to the recall expenses and investment in market-driving activities. For HDFS, we now expect operating income to be up modestly in 2015 compared to 2014. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2015 to be between $240 million, $260 million as we increase investment in product development, focused on bringing exciting new products to market and as we continue to invest in our systems infrastructure. 
Finally, we continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate will be approximately 35.5%, which reflects the absence of the R&D tax credit in 2015. This guidance does not include the impact of the anticipated Canadian distributor transaction. We expect the financial impact to be dilutive in 2015 to earnings per share by approximately $0.04 behind upfront transition costs. This impact would be realized largely in the third quarter. 
So looking back on the quarter, while we are facing significant competitive pressures around the world, we are pleased with our key accomplishments during the second quarter. We successfully maintained a strong gross margin percent despite lower volumes and unfavorable currency exchange, implemented market driving actions which drove June retail sales, expanded distribution of Street in the new international markets and delivered shareholder value through the repurchase of 165 million in company shares and announced a $0.75 billion recapitalization. 
For the second half of 2015, we will navigate a challenging business environment. We remain confident in our shipment guidance and the actions we are taking to support retail sales in the second half of the year. We will continue to position the company for long-term success by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins, strong returns and value to our shareholders.

You're absolutely right, it's very difficult to pinpoint an absolute percent of cannibalization, but we believe it's very low. And some of that is evidenced by the last 4 quarters. We have seen our small cruisers which includes Sportster and Street grow well into the double digits behind Street in the United States. And now internationally, certainly, most all customers coming in are new to the brand. As Matt had mentioned, 9 out of 10 in Europe are new to the brand and almost all of the folks in India are new.

And then just as a follow-up, I was just wondering if you could help us understand the cadence of retail sales in the quarter. I think the conventional wisdom was that retail sales were down earlier in the quarter and then ramped at the end. So I was just wondering if you could address the cadence."

So 2 pieces -- let's separate 2 pieces of the first question as retail and shipments. So retail sales were down 1.4% in the first half, and we are expecting retail sales certainly to accelerate in the back half of the year that supports our shipment guidance, which is up 2 to 4 percentage points. But shifting to the specific question, Felicia, on shipments, if we look at overall shipments in the first half of this year, we are -- we're down 4.7% in shipments. And as you looked at kind of year-to-date year to go, it would hit that 2.4 -- 2% to 4% shipment growth guidance, we would need our shipments to be up in the back half of 14% to 19%. So let's start out with the half and then we'll get into the 2 quarters in the back half. The reason that we're looking to ship more in the back half of the year is not really related to retail sales, it's related to what happened last year. Felicia, if you remember last year, we had a very terrible, very tough weather in the United States. And consequently, we ended up shipping in more motorcycles in the first half than retail sales warranted. And then we spent the second half taking production and shipments out of the back half to get inventories back in line. Consequently, last year, at the end of the second quarter, our retail inventories were up too high and resulted in more carryover units than we would have liked. So again, our focus is always on aggressively managing supply in line with demand and making sure we're adequately supplying the market. So what we did this year is just to reverse out what happened last year. So we shipped in less this year than we retailed in order to bring down second quarter retail inventories this year. And we couldn't be happier as to where we're at. As we had mentioned, we're down 1,600 units. But when you adjust out the Street motorcycles, inventories are down significantly in line with where we believe we need to be to have a very smooth transition into the new model year 2016 motorcycles. And consequently, because we were down so much in last year's second half in shipments, we will become coincidingly up 14% to 19%. Now what you've done is taken our shipment guidance of 54,000 to 59,000 in the third quarter. And seeing that overall shipment, that suggested shipments will be higher in the fourth quarter and that is true. And so now when we look at the back half of those 2 quarters, we are moving production from the first part of the year to the fourth quarter. And the reason being is we become very good at flexible manufacturing. And we have matched up our production with our demand very well, given the manufacturing system that we have. But as we looked at last year, that required a fair amount of down days in the fourth quarter and probably hurt efficiencies a little bit. So what we want to do is balance out production a little bit in the back half of the year between the third and fourth quarters. That will have a little bit of a headwind in terms of gross margin between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But on aggregate, it won't have an impact. So again, we're smoothing out production a little bit, that's translating into a little bit more shipments in the fourth quarter. The second question that you asked is the cadence in second quarter retail sales. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've got a three-pronged approach to addressing the competitiveness. And we're addressing that in a Harley-Davidson's way, which is not price discounting. We've talked about this the last time, we will not meet discounting with discounting, we will not put hangtags on our motorcycles. That is certainly the easiest way to address some of the competitiveness we're experiencing in the United States. So with this three-pronged approach, most of those activities got into the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June, and we have seen very strong results coming from that. And so in April and May, retail sales were pretty soft, softer than what we saw in the first quarter. However, June, we built a very strong momentum and we're up near double digits in the United States, as well as near double digit in international markets behind the investments that we've made to kind of close that competitive gap."

Again, the bulk of that we're seeing in the shipment cadence and shipping more in the second half than the first half, is to correct last year's shipping patterns that were disrupted by the unfavorable weather. Clearly, as we look at our production, as well as our shipments, we're taking into account various market activities, certainly our new products that are coming out, and so all of that is considered. But the biggest driver in the splits of being down in the first half to up in the second half is really what happened last year and getting those inventories in line. When we talk about inventory growth, I would assume, Craig, that you're referring to at the end of the year. We expect and continue to expect inventory at the end of the year to be flat to up modestly, and that does take into account the various models that we have in the marketplace. And I'm sorry -- thank you, Amy. That is -- that answer is with regards to the United States, that we expect it to be flat to up modestly. Internationally, we do expect inventories to rise as we add new dealer points. And we're continuing on a similar pattern of adding dealers that we were in previous years. Actually, in the quarter, we added 11 new dealers which we're very thrilled about. So with that, internationally, we will be putting more inventory to support that growth."

And I think about those trends going forward, which do you expect to get better and when does your guidance assume that those share losses that you've seen in the first half of the year flatten out or maybe even flip into it, a share gain as we think about third and fourth quarters of this year?"

The first question, industry growth and our retail, so what we have said is that we expect flat to modestly up growth, and that is tied to basically holding turns flat. However, when we look at that, number one is we are expecting retail growth in the back half, and we're certainly expecting to support our shipment guidance of up 2% to 4% withholding those inventories at year end in the United States. And we're also looking -- when we talk about inventory, we're looking at forward turns and what we expect to sell into the future as well. The second question that you had, James, is with regards to market trends. Why don't we start out with the first half. We have had a tough half, largely driven by the price discounting, but overall market share was down 3.5 percentage points. The bulk of that share loss is due to price competition in the marketplace. The second biggest driver of the market share loss in the first half was the inclusion of autocycles in the motorcycle industry numbers. And these are a vehicle that's included, that is very car-like, it's got side-by-side seating, gas pedal and breaks, a steering wheel, very large front end, it just happens to have a single wheel in the back. States are having trouble figuring out what it is in terms of it is a motorcycle, is it registrable, is it an autocycle. But in any event, we do not believe that it competes directly with traditional motorcycles, but it is having a large impact on our overall market share because we're 50% of the market. So those are the 2 largest drivers of market share losses. As we move forward, we expect certainly our share losses to mitigate. We saw that in the quarter. If you look within the quarter, we kind of talked about the retail sales cadence within the quarter which improved very much in the previous question. But market share as well improved significantly in the quarter as we got some of our market response actions out. So as we move forward, we would expect market shares to temper, especially in the fourth quarter when we start to lap the initial impact of the price discounting."

We would expect revenues to be down 5% and the impact on gross margin in the third quarter to about 1 full percentage point headwind. And the other piece that we had mentioned when we were talking about shipment and production cadence, we are moving more production into the fourth quarter, and that will have an impact of moving a little bit of gross margin out of the previous quarters into the fourth quarter.

We're reporting results as of the end of the second quarter and we're not going to go beyond that.

We're reporting results as of the end of the second quarter and we're not going to go beyond that. But again, what we saw in the first quarter and the change in shift and momentum, we feel very good about our overall second half. The second question is with regards to what we had talked about in addressing some of the competitive issues. We've got a three-pronged approach, and you can see most notably in there is brand damaging discounting is not a part of it. So we're very pleased with what we've got. It's not as easy, it's not as quick. We've got to be a lot more creative in how we do it, and the results are very strong. But when we look at the various pieces, they all work in concert with each other, right? When you look at the lifestyle and brand advertising, that's an investment in the future, an investment in the brand and the brand premium. Hard to measure what that does on a day-to-day basis. The second piece of it is targeted finance offers that is trying to close some of the competitive gap that we have in the marketplace. We haven't talked much about discounting, but it certainly has not improved on a quarter-over-quarter business. It remains consistent to a little bit increase. We're seeing a couple more competitors and we're also seeing the level go up a little bit. Now the top discount out there is $4,000 a motorcycle. So the targeted finance offers are just that very targeted and they allow us to work on some of that price gap. I will also say that being able to do this with HDFS is absolutely a fantastic benefit and advantage to us. We've immediately got over 700 dealers in the United States, we can access some -- we can offer the same thing, and we can get execution very pristine across the U.S. And certainly, HDFS is proving to be a tremendous advantage. And then the last piece is really leveraging some of our competitive advantages, things that we have that no one else does. First and foremost is the dealer network and getting their focus where we need it to be. And then the second, our assets such as Rider Academy. And so a program like this, and Matt had mentioned it in his prepared remarks, is we've offered free rider training to all veteran and active military folks. And this is an incredibly brand enhancing opportunity for us and it comes at a very efficient price. So we're not seeing the benefits of that in the first half. We launched that in the middle of May and we've seen overwhelming response, of interest. And what's going to take these folks to get enrolled in Riding Academy, complete the course and then purchase a motorcycle. So this is something that's going to drive more in the second half, certainly, than it did in the first half. And it will be a very strong brand enhancing point with about 1/3 of our customers that buy new motorcycles in any given year."

I think that the energy that we put in, in the quarter is really smart, creative, reinforcing ways to compete.

So our energy is around high-quality things that convey the core meaning, the core value of joining the Harley-Davidson brand versus another choice people might have. I think the Rider Academy veterans program is a great example of the kind of great work that we're doing internally to do smart things to grow the business long term. As John mentioned, practically none of that investment is in the second quarter numbers yet, but we couldn't be more impressed with the response in numbers and the nature of the response as far as how people are feeling about Harley-Davidson's investment in our veterans."

And we expected this as we entered into the quarter. We're",589,"Thanks, Tim. So Touring shipments, so Tim, what you're referring to is on the shipment slide. When we look at percent of total, Street was basically up 4 percentage points and Touring was down 4. And we expected this as we entered into the quarter. We're continuing to grow our shipments of Street as we fulfill the international rollout. And when everything adds up to 100, something's got to come down and when we look, Touring is down. And the previous 4 quarters, we had our Cruiser business down about 6 percentage points, and certainly there was a lot of concern with regards to that. But whenever we're looking at the total and we're investing in different parts of the business, something's got to come down. One, we're very thrilled that we're seeing stability in the Cruiser number in terms of percent of total. And there are no issues whatsoever with Touring, it's just that as one goes up, something has got to come down. And I will say that actually Touring is  doing -- continues to do very strong. We had mentioned that we lapped a 31% increase on the year-ago numbers and our Rushmore sales were still up on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So we're very pleased with that business. The second question that you had, Tim, is Canada. So in early August, we expect to step into the shoes of our distributor in Canada. Again, we would expect from the overall transaction, what's going to happen is that we will receive a little bit more revenue, and that is the margin that we pay and have paid our distributor in Canada will go away and we'll distribute directly to our dealers in Canada. So we'll see a tiny bit more revenue, we're not going to be able to see it on a -- it won't be a big impact to the whole thing but certainly from a Canada perspective. And then the second piece of it is that we will also assume the expenses for running that market. So SG&A will increase in the third quarter and ongoing. Now when we net the higher revenue and the SG&A out over time, that will be beneficial. We'll have more revenue than SG&A, and therefore the transaction will be accretive into the future. However, in the short term, as we transition, there's various things that we need to do from a people's standpoint, a systems standpoint, a logistics standpoint to step into those shoes, and we do expect in the near term for it to be a cost of about $0.04 per share. And again, by the nature of when we get into this, most of that will happen in the terms -- in terms of the third quarter and in terms of higher SG&A spending. And your final question, Tim, was with regards to HDFS and the finance promotions that were in the second quarter. When we look at the biggest drivers of those promotions on HDFS were really to originations, which were up 7% and the receivables that were up 5%. When we look at the income, which again had a very strong quarter at HDFS up 10%, very little of that, if any, is captured in this. Remember, these are 60-month loans. They really got in the marketplace in mid-May to mid-June. So you're picking up maybe 1/60 of that loan. So very little, if any, impact in terms of the overall financial performance is due to that activity in the second quarter."

I understand the rationale for trying to balance out some of the production in shipments to get some better absorption in the fourth quarter. But if retail seasonality doesn't change, how do you not end up with a higher inventory situation? It was the first question, the second question is, the -- can you just go over the net interest margin at HDFS in the quarter? It was up but volumes were down, and I don't think spreads are getting better. So is there some mix impact there? Or is it related to what you just said on the question prior which is there is just not much of an impact from the current quarter in the HDFS results this quarter?"

And Q4 inventories will end up similar to where we always expect it. So we'll balance some of that with just lower inventories going into the fourth quarter, retail inventories. The second question, Joe, is with regards to HDFS results. We are continuing to see attractive spreads in our business there. If you look at the bridge there, you're seeing that net interest income is up, I believe, it was $4.6 million. And that was due to higher receivables, offset by a little bit of lower spreads on due to the competition, and we've seen that for the last 4 quarters. What we are not seeing, the 0.99 loans that we have in the marketplace playing out in that. And as we go forward, we will see a contraction in spreads as some of those loans move through. Now some of those loans are also subvented by the motor company, so there's not -- HDFS is not going to feel the full impact of that. We do very little subvention between companies. I don't think in 2012 or 2013 we did any. Last year we did some because of the excess inventory due to the weather, I think it amounted about 3% of the overall loans. So we will see a little bit of tightening of spreads as those loans move through the portfolio, but we're not seeing any of it in the second quarter. And again, overall, we feel very good about the business at HDFS. And hopefully, everyone caught the fact that we've changed our guidance to be down modestly on a year-over-year basis, to be up modestly year-over-year basis. And the team at HDFS have done an absolutely fantastic job managing that business."

So the pricing where -- we typically take pricing at model year, so the bulk of that $19 million you're seeing on the bridge is from pricing that we took last August. Over the last several years, we've been taking pricing with the exception of the Rushmore year, but net pricing in excess of cost has been about 0.5 percentage point for the last several years, and that's what you're seeing in that $19 million. Last year, August, pricing increased revenue by about 1 percentage point, cost of goods sold increased by about 0.5 percentage point and gross margin was up about 0.5 point. So that is simply playing out. Now interim, we did take a little bit of pricing in Europe. Not that much to drive that $19 million, but we raised prices in Europe, I believe, in late March by 1.2 percentage points and that was to help mitigate some of the currency actions that we saw. But the bulk of what you're seeing was done a year ago. And again, we will look to provide the market and you guys with what our pricing looks like for model year 2016 on August 24."

So in the first half of this year within our dealer network, and as we've talked before, very difficult to really put your finger on used bike pricing, right? There's 40-or-so models, they span over a 10-year period of time, there's all kinds of customization, different levels of customization within models. So it's not an easy thing, really, to ferret out. But the best that we can tell within our dealer network in the first half is that used bike prices are stable. Now within that, we're seeing used bike prices firm up a little bit in Touring, largely flat in Sportsters and down slightly in our large Cruisers and Dynas and Sports -- on Dynas and Softails.

Last quarter, I talked about my confidence in the strength of the business, our strategies and our team. Today, despite some disappointing results, but thanks to a lot of great strategy and planning work we've done over the last several months, I'm even more confident we have the foundation, plan and team in place to compete to win and lead in the marketplace. I'll talk more about our forward view and actions in a minute, but first, I want to share some perspectives on our quarter and year so far. 
You've read the results in this morning's press release, and it goes without saying the quarter and the year-to-date did not unfold the way we expected. The marketplace has thrown us some curveballs this year in competition has ramped up, whether it's a currency-driven advantage for competitors in the U.S. or new products from competitors in EMEA. We've also had some headwinds of our own making such as product availability and voluntary recalls. We fully recognize we have to raise our game. We challenged our playbook acted to drive demand, reallocated spending and fast-tracked initiatives. Some of our actions like the U.S. military learn to ride initiative and the rollout of our new 2016 models hit the mark and stimulated demand. Some of our actions did less than we expected, but the bottom line on Q3 is our performance did not meet our expectations. We know we can do better, and we will. 
Moving forward, we're taking what we've learned and are applying it. We continue to refine our investments and sharpen our resolve. And that's why I'm more confident now than ever in our ability to compete and win. Part of this confidence comes from the nature of the successes we did see and part of it rests on the incredible foundation already in place and our plans to take it to the next level. In short, we're going to dial things up. As you know, 6 years ago, we introduced our plan to grow our reach and impact with more customers globally. To do so, we're committed to do what it took to be great at our core work of product development, manufacturing and retail. Today, much of that work is complete with fine-tuning ongoing. We have incredible strengths that we can leverage and maximize. We know how to develop great customer-led products and get them to market in world-class time, and we will do even more in this area. We know how to manufacture to effectively meet dynamic global customer demand. We know what customers expect at retail, and our industry-leading dealers are equipped to provide best-in-class customer experiences. We have a tremendous brand that ignites passion in every one of our customers, and most importantly, we've proven that our strong appeal with U.S. core customers extends to everyone of our U.S. outreach segments and to our international customers in both developed and emerging markets.  As we look to the future, our plan to grow our reach and impact with customers globally has not changed. And at their core, our focus areas I'll be talking about today our natural extensions of a strong foundation we have in place. 
So let's talk about our path ahead. We've got 5 clear objectives. One, lead in every market. This means achieving and holding the #1 share of the 601 CC Motorcycle segment. This is not just about competing but winning. This is the objective we're all most energized by. Two, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of U.S. core customers and growing U.S. outreach customers at a faster rate. We're already making great progress in this area as we have more than doubled the rate of growth in sales to outreach customers versus sales to core customers in each of the last 4 years and are on track to do so this year as well. Three, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate. We have a target to grow the international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Four, grow revenue and grow earnings faster than revenue through 2020. And finally, outperform the S&P 500. 
So those are the objectives. Now let's talk about how we plan to achieve them in a market environment we expect will continue to be highly competitive. A minute ago, I talked about dialing things up. But I don't mean just for a quarter or a year. Now is the time for incremental investment to drive demand. For 2016 and beyond, we've challenged ourselves to reallocate existing spending into demand-driving investments in both customer-facing marketing and new product development. In 2016, we'll increase our investment in customer-facing marketing by approximately 65% above 2015 levels. We also plan to increase our investment in new product development by approximately 35% from 2015 levels. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our commitment to new products, we had already substantially increased our investment this year in new product development, which means that our planned investment for 2016 in the next several years will be nearly twice what it was in just 2014. In dollar terms, these investments in product development and marketing represent an approximate $70 million increase in our investment to drive demand compared to 2015. Our investments will be focused in 4 key areas. First, increasing product and brand awareness. Second, growing new ridership in the United States. Third, increasing and enhancing brand access. And finally, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. 
Now let's talk about each one in turn, starting with product and brand awareness. We've got fantastic industry-leading products and there's more to come. We can do more to let people know about them, whether it's with people who aspire to take up riding, riders of competitive brands or existing customers who can trade up to a new Harley-Davidson model that has even more of the latest features and technology. Next, grow new ridership in the United States. We know the importance of bringing new riders into the brand and into the sport of motorcycling. One of the key ways to grow ridership is to make it easier for people to learn to ride. We've already seen great success with our Harley-Davidson Riding Academy, training more than 220,000 riders worldwide since 2010. With the rebranding of our program and the opportunity to learn to ride on a Harley-Davidson Street 500, along with the launch of the U.S. military rider training initiative, we've grown our rider training by 25% over 2014. We've created a pipeline to riding and we're going to do even more by expanding on our successful programs. We're set to more than double the numbers of riders trained annually through the Riding Academy to over 100,000 globally by 2020, with the majority in the United States. The third area of focus is to increase and enhance brand access, increasing customer touch points with Harley-Davidson. First and foremost, this is about continuing to expand and enhance our incredibly strong global dealer network, which provides one of the greatest competitive differentiators for our brand through the service and experiences they deliver. As I shared, we have a target to grow our international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Beyond traditional dealerships, we're developing new retail formats for urban centers and urban tastes. ECommerce expansion is also key. Currently, Harley-Davidson products are available via eCommerce in the U.S., India and China, but look for more markets to come. Importantly, we'll also accelerate the cadence and impact of new products and extend our leadership in the features and technologies that matter to customers. Things like link breaks, engine performance and environmental enhancements, aerodynamics and electric vehicle technology. Project Rushmore bikes and Project LiveWire are great early examples of our capability and resolve to deliver technology and innovation to inspire our riders. I won't go into details about what's coming down the pipeline, but there will be a steady drumbeat ranging from product updates and refreshes to new products and meaningful technology, including new engines and all new motorcycles from the ground up too. 
So there you have it. We're committed to dialing up our strengths and growing Harley-Davidson by increasing our reach and impact. All of this will require smart and strong plans, agility, accountability and commitment from our entire team. We're ready and we're committed, and we know as we show with manufacturing and product development, that when we're all committed, we do amazing things. I want to be crystal clear, the path forward will play out over a number of years. This isn't about improving results for a quarter or even a year. This is about where we want to be in 3 years, 5 years and even 10 years. We'll continue to build on our plans, adapt and adjust as we need to. 
So as I wrap up my comments, I hope you've noticed a common theme: market leadership. The path we're on is all about asserting our already substantial leadership in the industry and continuing to drive sustainable growth well into the future. We're going to lead and compete with clear purpose and intent. We're going to lead boldly and unapologetically. We're not just going to compete, we're here to win. With that, I'll turn it over to John. John?"

Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results following the press release and slides. The summary of our third quarter financial results starts on Slide 14. During the quarter, revenue was $1.32 billion, net income was",2341,"Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results following the press release and slides. The summary of our third quarter financial results starts on Slide 14. During the quarter, revenue was $1.32 billion, net income was $140.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69, all achieved in an incredibly challenging environment. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was down 2.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Motorcycles segment gross margin continued to be very strong despite unfavorable currency impact. The Motorcycle business operating margin percent was down slightly driven by lower gross margin and slightly higher SG&A spending.  At HDFS, operating income was down 6.4% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interests expense resulting from our recent recapitalization plan. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's look at retail sales on Slide 15. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the third quarter. Retail sales were below our expectations, and as a result, we are adjusting our full year shipment guidance down by 11,000 motorcycles. We now expect to ship between 265 and 270,000 motorcycles, approximately flat to down 2% versus prior year. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to manage supply in line with demand and protect our brand premium. Looking forward, we expect to return to growth as we benefit from our new 2016 model year motorcycles, increased investment in demand driving actions, improved product availability and the overall strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. 
Turning to the U.S. on Slide 16, third quarter retail sales were down 2.5%, adversely impacted by continued intense competitive activity lapping the enthusiastic Rushmore response, and limited availability on certain models. These significant challenges were partially offset by our market response actions initiated in the second quarter. While we believe these actions were effective, they were not sufficient given the headwinds we faced in the U.S. During the quarter, the U.S. industry grew 4.5%. We had a very strong market share leadership share position of 52.4%, and we believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter is a sign of industry strength going forward. However, our Q3 market share was down 3.9 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last 4 quarters was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. Dealers' retail inventories were consistently below prior year levels throughout the quarter, which adversely affected availability on certain models. Inventories recovered by quarter end and finished the quarter up slightly to prior year. We continue to expect year-end retail inventories to be flat to slightly -- to up slightly compared to last year, reflecting the incremental new models launched in the 2016 model year. 
On Slide 17, retail sales in our international markets were up 0.9% in the third quarter. In the EMEA region, retail sales were up despite the impact of new models introduced by competitive brands and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in nonlocal currencies. Year-to-date, Europe market share was down 1.6 percentage points behind the impact of new low-priced models and the performance and standard segments, market segments where we do not compete. In the Asia Pacific region, emerging markets continue to experience growth. However, retail sales in the region were negatively impacted as a result of very limited availability of Street motorcycles in August and early September, following a voluntary recall initiated in July. The supply of Street motorcycles was largely restored by the end of the quarter. Latin America region retail sales were down in the quarter as a results of soft retail sales in Brazil behind a weak economy, consumer uncertainty and aggressive price competition. Brazil declines were partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down modestly in a highly competitive environment. We believe the market responded well to the change to a direct distribution model, which took effect at the beginning of August and to a reduction in pricing with model year 2016 motorcycles. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by expanding our distribution network, building on our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders. 
On Slide 18, wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were up 5.5% compared to last year, but slightly below our expected range of 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles in response to the lower-than-expected retail sales during the quarter. The overall shipment mix reflects a significantly higher percent of Cruiser shipments behind our model year 2016 product investments. On Slide 19, revenue for the Motorcycles segment was up in Q3 compared to last year, driven by 5.5% higher motorcycle shipments partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 5.2% and unfavorable mix. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $899 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Motorcycle and MSRP prices for our new 2016 model year motorcycles have increased by an average of about 1%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of costs is up about a half a percent expressed as a percent of revenue. Parts and Accessory revenue grew 5.2% behind strong new products sales, while General Merchandise revenue was down slightly. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
On Slide 20, gross margin in the quarter was 34.6% which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin was very strong during the quarter when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange which was $29.9 million unfavorable for the third quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies which devalued an average of 18% compared to the prior year. While manufacturing was unfavorable during the quarter, year-to-date manufacturing was favorable by $7.4 million behind strong productivity gains, partially offset by lower year-over-year production. Our gross margin performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. 
On Slide 21, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 12.5%, down 0.4 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to the consolidation of Canada and to our operations, partially offset by other favorabilities. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on an operating investment profile that will drive top line growth. Coupled with a continuous improvement mindset, we will drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 22. During the quarter, HDFS operating profit decreased 6.4% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the recent low rate promotional activity. The provision for retail loan losses was unfavorable to prior year due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in receivables. HDFS' third quarter operations are summarized on Slide 23. HDFS' retail loan originations increased 14.3% compared to last year's third quarter primarily driven by a 9.6 percentage point increase in our U.S. market share and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. The strong market share performance was driven by the third quarter promotional offers. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company. At the end of the quarter, we have $405 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had nearly $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. 
On Slide 24, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 3.16% or 16 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continue to perform at near record low levels. Annualized retail credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.19% compared to last year's third quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime origination in recent years, as well as changing consumer behavior. During the third quarter, HDFS continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 25. I would like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $1.02 billion in the first 9 months of this year. Operating cash was up $54.1 million from last year driven by lower wholesale lending and lower working capital partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain, a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 26, returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share. In addition we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $536 million. During the third quarter, we also began to execute our recapitalization plan. Details of the plan are on Slide 27. We successfully borrowed $750 million in a combination of both 10 year and 30-year notes. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and share -- repurchasing shares. 
Before I update our 2015 guidance on Slide 28, I want to discuss changes that we will make to the company's motorcycle operating investment profile in 2016 as that will have an impact on our Q4 and full year 2015 results. As Matt discussed in 2016, we will significantly increase our investment to drive demand. We will source the funds by reallocating from our existing spending, primarily from support functions and through reorganization of our commercial operations aimed at being both leaner and stronger. And again, we expect to increase our investment in customer-facing marketing activities by approximately 65% from 2015 levels. We also expect to increase our investment in new product development by 35% from 2015 levels. As we prepare the organization for this new operating investment profile, we expect to incur onetime expenses in Q4 of 2015 of approximately $30 million to $35 million. These onetime expenses will largely consist of employee separation and reorganization costs. We expected the significant change will address the current competitive environment and will accelerate top line growth over the next several years. 
Now let's talk about guidance for the full year. For the full year 2015, we now expect to ship 265 to 270,000 motorcycles which is approximately flat to down 2% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship 47 to 52,000 motorcycles, which is approximately flat to up 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2015, we now believe operating margin for the Motorcycles segment will be between 16% and 17% compared to 18.0% in 2014. Our lower operating margin expectations are due to lower shipment expectations, onetime charges we expect in Q4 and increased recall expenses during the third quarter. In 2015, we continue to expect gross margin will be up modestly compared to 2014 impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect a favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and increased pension expense. To dimentionalize the foreign currency exchange risks, if currents held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue will be adversely impacted by approximately four and a a quarter percent. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 0.75 percentage points.  As we look forward to 2016, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates through 2016, recognizing this as a hypothetical expectation in a very volatile exchange rate environment, we would expect approximately $45 million of additional unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact to gross margin as we lap the hedge benefits that we expect to realize in 2015. 
Looking at SG&A, excluding onetime charges we expect in Q4, we expect SG&A to be up in 2015 compared to last year. This includes the impact from the Canadian distributor transaction which occurred on August 4, 2015. The incremental SG&A impact of the Canadian transaction was approximately $10 million of increased expense in Q3. In Q4, we also expect approximately $10 million of SG&A expense related to Canadian operations. Our guidance for HDFS and CapEx remain unchanged. We now expect full year tax rate to be approximately 35% versus previously expected 35.5%. 
So that's the quarter. While the results have fallen short of our expectations, we maintained a strong gross margin percent and delivered shareholder value through a $0.31 per share dividend and 536 million in share repurchases. But what's most important is what lies ahead. As Matt shared, we have a clear path forward and are making investments we believe are necessary to drive demand and grow our business and achieve our goals. 
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. With that, we'll open it up to your questions."

Hoping you could give some color on where specifically you're seeing the increased kind of competition from either new competitive supply or the competition in EMEA. And then secondly, with the model year '16 bikes, how do you think those bikes are being perceived by both customers and dealers? How does that play into this market share theme as well?"

In terms of market share there United States, we were down 3.9%, pretty much in line with what we have seen over the last 4 quarters, and again, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw world currency shift and incredible increase in overall competitive discounting. So that's a big portion of the 3.9 points of share loss. In addition we've seen more competition in terms of new product. And also, probably the biggest driver of share loss in the quarter was from a new product called autocycles. That's included in the MIC numbers. And we do not believe that they compete head-to-head with motorcycles. It's a very different product. It's much more car-like, it has side-by-side seating, a gas pedal and steering wheel but it is classified in the MIC numbers. So the biggest piece of that share loss come from the inclusion of motorcycles and overall market share. The thing that we're most excited about is next quarter and the fourth quarter we start to lap on the beginning of the softness due to the competitive discounting, and so we'll have a little bit easier comps as we move into the fourth quarter and throughout next year. In terms of EMEA, it's been a highly competitive market there as well. That has not been driven by price competition as much as it has been in the U.S. In EMEA, it's really driven by a couple of new products. They are what we would call a middle-weight displacement in the 700 to 900 CC category and they're in the performance and standard segments. We compete in Cruisers and -- but these products have had a tremendous impact on the market. They've been very well-received and actually driving the year-to-date growth in the European market up 10%. So first couple of quarters had hit us pretty hard with regards to market share loss in Europe, much better in the third quarter. Retail sales turned positive, 2.4%. The European team is doing a great job, they came out with a couple of significant promotions, Custom Kings, which is a competition of personalizing and customizing our Street motorcycles, as well as King of Demos, and they've done a magnificent job of turning that around and we're very pleased with what we're seeing in the third quarter there. The last question that you asked, Kevin, is with regards to model year '16 motorcycles. We feel very good about the model year '16 launch and so do our dealers. And a lot of times, people compared going back to Rushmore, Rushmore was an incredible year for us and that about 15% of our volume and half our models were redone. We're going to see those from time to time but they're not going to be every year. With that, our model year '16 was focused on our Cruiser bikes, and we added a tremendous amount of power to those bikes by adding our high output 103 engine. We added cruise control to Softails. And in addition, we added or significantly improved 5 models. There was 2 S models which include a 110 engine and they have sold extremely well, as well as a new Road Glide Ultra and 2 refreshes of our most popular Sportsters in Iron 883 and 48. As you look at the quarter, we were very light on supply. Our supply could not meet the demand of those 5 models. We ended the quarter with about 1 bike per dealer in the U.S. in inventory. So still very light as we exited the quarter on inventory for those 5 models and that will be replenished in the fourth quarter."

But as we've discussed many times, we're focused on really reading what our customer is looking for from Harley-Davidson, making smart decisions about the products that are going to drive demand and getting them to market in world-class time. And that is embedded now on our product development capability set. So you won't have to wait years and years for that stuff to start seeing the market. And with respect to the marketing investment, our focus on that is that is discretionary dollars, if you will, not embedded in people. So that we have the flexibility to invest that money within the year and across years in the most effective manner to drive the most effective growth. So, thanks."

And there's a couple of drivers of that, one is the absorption of 11,000 units which certainly affects our gross margin. Having said that, Craig, our gross margin we still expect to be up on a year-over-year basis. And I can't stress enough how important that is and how powerful the margin structure is at Harley-Davidson. So you look at gross margin, we're going to have well over $100 million hit in currency, which is 3/4 of a percentage point. We're going to have unfavorable mix as we invest on an incredibly powerful product such as Street, and we've also will have lower year-over-year production and, therefore, a headwind on production. And yet, still our gross margin is going to grow in 2015. And that's driven by the ability to price our products and the incredible productivity that we're driving out of the plants. So that will stay with us in 2015 and 2016 as we go forward. Also affecting operating margin this year is higher nonrepeating SG&A expenses. So what we've got is 3 SG&A expenses that are affecting our overall guidance for the remainder of this year. One is the onetime expenses of $30 million to $35 million, and this is money spent already for that new investment profile to significantly increase our investment and demand driving activities into 2016 and beyond. The second is incorporation of Canada in the guidance. Remember, we didn't have that in our guidance after the second quarter, and we've talked about that being $0.04 dilutive. While that's all coming in the form of higher SG&A as we transition that business and size it, appropriately size it to gain the synergies out of us managing that market. And then the third piece of it is certainly anticipated recall expense of $15 million in the third quarter. So you take the lower absorption and the SG&A. That's what's driving our gross margin to be down. So to answer your question, Craig, is the gross margin is incredibly strong and powerful, and that will continue to move into next year. We will have some headwinds in currency in 2016. But overall, very strong gross margin. And these things that we're talking about affecting operating margin are all nonrepeating items."

And, in fact, this intensity got dialed up when we had our first Rushmore-related recall here shortly after launch.

I would say that in my time here, we've never had a more significant view on all the things we need to do to assure quality. We enjoy incredible loyalty and incredible trust on the part of our riders. We would do nothing to violate that. It's incredibly valuable to us and these recalls have been very disappointing to the company and to our riders and to our dealers. There's no question about it. I will say that there's nothing more important than the safety of our riders. They are not in sitting in cars with seatbelts and airbags and sheet metal around them. We understand immediately any safety implications that might exist with the quality problem. We get on it as quickly as we can, and we act decisively in the interest and safety of our riders. In the, meanwhile, we're doing everything that we know and we are bringing all sorts of outside expertise into auditing, assessing and advising us in what we need to do to get out of this state with these product quality issues that we've suffered.

So coming out of Q4 with the currency-driven, currency-enabled discounting and into Q1, we started to see the impact on our business.

That is to preserve the premium nature of the brand in the marketplace, and that is absolutely critical to us. However, it becomes, I guess, the first quarter in particular started to really resonate with me from the standpoint of that's we're only talking about half the side of that equation. And what do we need to do as a business to drive demand? And so beginning really in Q2, we took action, we had a lot of early plans, we were a little bit behind the seasonality curve at that point in time. So it didn't have the effect that we expected and we're driving forth for this year. But as I said in my opening remarks, it taught us a lot about what works, what doesn't work, and where we need to apply ourselves with more focus and more intensity, to drive demand in a quality way globally for the long-term. So that's what we're about, and that's what we've been working on really through Q2 and in earnest in Q3, and we will carry forward through Q4 with the restructuring to get ourselves fully set up to start really delivering in 2016. And I would say that from my perspective, this is a pivotal moment for the company. We've been talking for 6 years about transformation, and we're pivoting from transformation to driving demand. And that's Harley-Davidson at this point in time, in the midst of that pivot. So thanks for the question."

So we had talked about, we started to get money out of the market in mid-May to the to mid-June timeframe if you recall and we had a three-pronged approach to doing that. And then we had very good results in the month of June. Month of June was up near double digit, both in the international markets as well as the United States. And that momentum continued into July. Matter-of-fact, in July, we were ahead of our plan. Our retail plan in July and the growth continued into the first half of August. Starting to get softer and in the back half of August, and September was down. So things were going according to plan until about halfway through the quarter, and they turned a little bit negative. And again, the spending that we did was effective, but certainly not sufficient given the headwinds that we faced. The comps also progressively got worse through the quarter as well, and than we had some issues with availability in the United States and certainly in our Asia-Pacific markets, with inventories being down. When you looked at the U.S., inventory, while it finished up a little bit on a year-over-year basis, for 12 of the 13 weeks, it was down quite a bit. And a lot of that time up to down 10%. So that puts some pressure on the United States and certainly with the new products that we came out with, those 5 models, the demand outstripped our ability to supply those. And again, still a little bit light on those inventories as you move into the fourth quarter and in addition, the recalls that we had, we had 2 recalls in the middle of the quarter and they had an impact on some of our parts. In particular, on The Street motorcycles, a fuel pump, we couldn't produce them fast enough. So essentially dealers weren't selling motorcycles. Street motorcycles were up to 6 weeks during the third quarter. The biggest impact of that was in Asia Pacific. Even though Asia Pacific was still up, it was certainly hindered by a lack of selling Street motorcycles for a period of that time. Inventories are back with regards to the Street and looking forward to a better fourth quarter."

How are we going to take the $70 million or the 65% increase in customer-facing marketing and drive demand. Part of it is through awareness. And you're absolutely right, Sharon, is a lot of this is through the brotherhood of riding and so on and so forth. But the fact of the matter is our share of voice has never been close to our share of market, and that's one of the benefits we'd get of having one of the world's most powerful brands. However, in the last couple of years, we have seen an incredible amount of marketing dollars coming in into the market and has been diluting our share of voice a bit. Just take the discounting for example. I mean, the tens and tens of millions of dollars of discounts are all being advertised through other United States and so we've lost a little bit on share of voice as well as the new products. So we're going to get that share of voice back, and yes, we've got tremendous things to talk about in terms of our new products and the products and experiences that we offer and we've fallen a little bit behind in that in terms of us being front and center. In terms of growing the ridership in the United States, Matt has actually getting back to your first question, that's worked very well is that things like the Military Rider Academy -- I'm sorry, free rider training. The response has been way in excess of our expectations. We've now got a quarter behind us on this and we're getting thousands of people through the Rider Academy program and we're starting to see the fruits of that pay off in the conversion rate which is better than what we typically see with the military going through and ultimately buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. So what's better than that is somebody that's never ridden, bringing them to the sport of motorcycling and getting them on a Harley-Davidson. So those type of things we're going to do a lot more next year and you're going to see a lot more of that type of investment. When we look at things that maybe didn't go as well, I would say they go as well but much short-term in nature, for example, the financing. The financing on what drove incremental sales in the early part of the quarter -- I'm sorry, the beginning of the quarter and we expected that and it did that. However, there is certainly diminishing returns on the type of investment and we never intended for that to go into our model year '16 motorcycles. And so the financing ended with the new model year, and again, that's not the way to build into the future is training customers for discounts. But it does. It is an important tool and it provided an opportunity for us to clear up some of the model year '15s. So we have learned from all of those things. We're going to do a lot of the things that work next year and we're going to bring more importantly a tremendous amount of resources to do that and we are also organizing our company to be much more demand focused in how we go-to-market with our dealers and our customers."

When we talk about looking forward 2016 and what we expect in terms of the delivery of the dollars in marketing and certainly the product is, number one, as we look at next year, much easier comps. So that starts with model year '16 and '17 and certainly going to drive volume for us, the continued rollout of Street, outreach growth. Through the year-to-date, outreach is up 7%, even overall volumes are down, we've been very successful in that avenue and continue that in 2016. And then finally, international expansion. This quarter alone we put up 14 dealerships internationally, which is a 2% increase in our overall international dealerships. And as Matt mentioned upfront, is we look to put up 15 to 20, 150 million to 200 new dealerships over the next 5 years, which represents a 20% to 25% increase in our international dealerships. So with all of that, we expect growth in 2016 and while we don't provide our guidance until January, I think you can expect that you'll see in the neighborhood of 3% to 5% shipment growth as we look to 2016. On the next question we asked is with regards to financing. It is very difficult to the pullout how much exactly is driven by the financing piece. When we initiated those projects, the successes and the take rate is very high. We could see our market share at HDFS was 70% in the quarter, certainly driven by an increased amount of financing. Difficult part is to see how much of those are incremental units. Again, at the onset, we felt it certainly drove some of the performance we had in the first part of the quarter, and but again not the way we want to go forward as training folks to buy on finance and promos."

So where we wouldn't have any impact on Canada, because we didn't have Canada in the previous year and didn't have those risk exposures. But we're looking at that $45 million is basically the gains that we took and the financial hedges that we had this year we would lap next year as those hedges will dissipate, go away.

Last quarter, I talked about my confidence in the strength of the business, our strategies and our team. Today, despite some disappointing results, but thanks to a lot of great strategy and planning work we've done over the last several months, I'm even more confident we have the foundation, plan and team in place to compete to win and lead in the marketplace. I'll talk more about our forward view and actions in a minute, but first, I want to share some perspectives on our quarter and year so far. 
You've read the results in this morning's press release, and it goes without saying the quarter and the year-to-date did not unfold the way we expected. The marketplace has thrown us some curveballs this year and competition has ramped up, whether it's a currency-driven advantage for competitors in the U.S. or new products from competitors in EMEA. We've also had some headwinds of our own making such as product availability and voluntary recalls. We fully recognize we have to raise our game. We challenged our playbook, acted to drive demand, reallocated spending and fast-tracked initiatives. Some of our actions like the U.S. Military learn-to-ride initiative and the rollout of our new 2016 models hit the mark and stimulated demand. Some of our actions did less than we expected, but the bottom line on Q3 is our performance did not meet our expectations. We know we can do better, and we will. 
Moving forward, we're taking what we've learned and are applying it. We continue to refine our investments and sharpen our resolve. And that's why I'm more confident now than ever in our ability to compete and win. Part of this confidence comes from the nature of the successes we did see and part of it rests on the incredible foundation already in place and our plans to take it to the next level. In short, we're going to dial things up. As you know, 6 years ago, we introduced our plan to grow our reach and impact with more customers globally. To do so, we committed to do what it took to be great at our core work of product development, manufacturing and retail. Today, much of that work is complete with fine-tuning ongoing. We have incredible strengths that we can leverage and maximize. We know how to develop great customer-led products and get them to market in world-class time, and we will do even more in this area. We know how to manufacture to effectively meet dynamic global customer demand. We know what customers expect at retail, and our industry-leading dealers are equipped to provide best-in-class customer experiences. We have a tremendous brand that ignites passion in every one of our customers, and most importantly, we've proven that our strong appeal with U.S. core customers extends to everyone of our U.S. outreach segments and to our international customers in both developed and emerging markets.  As we look to the future, our plan to grow our reach and impact with customers globally has not changed. And at their core, our focus areas, I'll be talking about today are natural extension of the strong foundations we have in place.  So let's talk about our path ahead. 
We've got 5 clear objectives. One, lead in every market. This means achieving and holding the #1 share of the 601+CC Motorcycle segment. This is not just about competing but winning. This is the objective we're all most energized by. Two, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of U.S. core customers and growing U.S. outreach customers at a faster rate. We're already making great progress in this area as we have more than doubled the rate of growth in sales to outreach customers versus sales to core customers in each of the last 4 years and are on track to do so this year as well. Three, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate. We have a target to grow the international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Four, grow revenue and grow earnings faster than revenue through 2020. And finally, outperform the S&P 500.  So those are the objectives. 
Now let's talk about how we plan to achieve them in a market environment we expect will continue to be highly competitive. A minute ago, I talked about dialing things up. But I don't mean just for a quarter or a year. Now is the time for incremental investment to drive demand. For 2016 and beyond, we've challenged ourselves to reallocate existing spending into demand-driving investments in both customer-facing marketing and new product development. In 2016, we'll increase our investment in customer-facing marketing by approximately 65% above 2015 levels. We also plan to increase our investment in new product development by approximately 35% from 2015 levels. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our commitment to new products, we had already substantially increased our investment this year in new product development, which means that our planned investment for 2016 in the next several years will be nearly twice what it was in just 2014. In dollar terms, these investments in product development and marketing represent an approximate $70 million increase in our investment to drive demand compared to 2015. Our investments will be focused in 4 key areas. First, increasing product and brand awareness. Second, growing new ridership in the United States. Third, increasing and enhancing brand access. And finally, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. 
Now let's talk about each one in turn, starting with product and brand awareness. We've got fantastic industry-leading products and there's more to come. We can do more to let people know about them, whether it's with people who aspire to take up riding, riders of competitive brands or existing customers who can trade up to a new Harley-Davidson model that has even more of the latest features and technology. Next, grow new ridership in the United States. We know the importance of bringing new riders into the brand and into the sport of motorcycling. One of the key ways to grow ridership is to make it easier for people to learn to ride. We've already seen great success with our Harley-Davidson Riding Academy, training more than 220,000 riders worldwide since 2010. With the rebranding of our program and the opportunity to Learn To Ride on a Harley-Davidson Street 500, along with the launch of the U.S. military rider training initiative, we've grown our rider training by 25% over 2014. We've created a pipeline to riding and we're going to do even more by expanding on our successful programs. We're set to more than double the numbers of riders trained annually through the Riding Academy to over 100,000 globally by 2020, with the majority in the United States. The third area of focus is to increase and enhance brand access, increasing customer touch points with Harley-Davidson. First and foremost, this is about continuing to expand and enhance our incredibly strong global dealer network, which provides one of the greatest competitive differentiators for our brand through the service and experiences they deliver. As I shared, we have a target to grow our international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Beyond traditional dealerships, we're developing new retail formats for urban centers and urban tastes. ECommerce expansion is also key. Currently, Harley-Davidson products are available via eCommerce in the U.S., India and China, but look for more markets to come. Importantly, we'll also accelerate the cadence and impact of new products and extend our leadership in the features and technologies that matter to customers. Things like link brakes, engine performance and environmental enhancements, aerodynamics and electric vehicle technology. Project Rushmore bikes and Project LiveWire are great early examples of our capability and resolve to deliver technology and innovation to inspire our riders. I won't go into details about what's coming down the pipeline, but there will be a steady drumbeat ranging from product updates and refreshes to new products and meaningful technology, including new engines and all new motorcycles from the ground up too. 
So there you have it. We're committed to dialing up our strengths in growing Harley-Davidson by increasing our reach and impact. All of this will require smart and strong plans, agility, accountability and commitment from our entire team. We're ready and we're committed, and we know as we show with manufacturing and product development, that when we're all committed, we do amazing things. I want to be crystal clear, the path forward will play out over a number of years. This isn't about improving results for a quarter or even a year. This is about where we want to be in 3 years, 5 years and even 10 years. We'll continue to build on our plans, adapt and adjust as we need to. 
So as I wrap up my comments, I hope you've noticed a common theme: market leadership. The path we're on is all about asserting our already substantial leadership in the industry and continuing to drive sustainable growth well into the future.

The summary of our third quarter financial results starts on Slide 14. During the quarter, revenue was $1.32 billion, net income was $140.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69, all achieved in an incredibly challenging environment. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was down 2.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Motorcycles segment gross margin continued to be very strong despite unfavorable currency impact. The Motorcycle business operating margin percent was down slightly driven by lower gross margin and slightly higher SG&A spending.  At HDFS, operating income was down 6.4% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interests expense resulting from our recent recapitalization plan. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's look at retail sales on Slide 15. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the third quarter. Retail sales were below our expectations, and as a result, we are adjusting our full-year shipment guidance down by 11,000 motorcycles. We now expect to ship between 265,000 and 270,000 motorcycles, approximately flat to down 2% versus prior year. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to manage supply in line with demand and protect our brand premium. Looking forward, we expect to return to growth as we benefit from our new 2016 model year motorcycles, increased investment in demand driving actions, improved product availability and the overall strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. 
Turning to the U.S. on Slide 16, third quarter retail sales were down 2.5%, adversely impacted by continued intense competitive activity, lapping the enthusiastic Rushmore response, and limited availability on certain models. These significant challenges were partially offset by our market response actions initiated in the second quarter. While we believe these actions were effective, they were not sufficient given the headwinds we faced in the U.S. During the quarter, the U.S. industry grew 4.5%. We had a very strong market share leadership share position of 52.4%, and we believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter is a sign of industry strength going forward. However, our Q3 market share was down 3.9 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last 4 quarters was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. Dealers' retail inventories were consistently below prior year levels throughout the quarter, which adversely affected product availability on certain models. Inventories recovered by quarter end and finished the quarter up slightly to prior year. We continue to expect year-end retail inventories to be flat to slightly -- to up slightly compared to last year, reflecting the incremental new models launched in the 2016 model year. 
On Slide 17, retail sales in our international markets were up 0.9% in the third quarter. In the EMEA region, retail sales were up despite the impact of new models introduced by competitive brands and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in nonlocal currencies. Year-to-date, Europe market share was down 1.6 percentage points behind the impact of new low-price models and the performance and standard segments, market segments where we do not compete. In the Asia Pacific region, emerging markets continue to experience growth. However, retail sales in the region were negatively impacted as a result of very limited availability of Street motorcycles in August and early September, following a voluntary recall initiated in July. The supply of Street motorcycles was largely restored by the end of the quarter. Latin America region retail sales were down in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil behind a weak economy, consumer uncertainty and aggressive price competition. Brazil declines were partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down modestly in a highly competitive environment. We believe the market responded well to the change to a direct distribution model, which took effect at the beginning of August and to a reduction in pricing with model year 2016 motorcycles. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by expanding our distribution network, building on our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders.
On Slide 18, wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were up 5.5% compared to last year, but slightly below our expected range of 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles in response to the lower-than-expected retail sales during the quarter. The overall shipment mix reflects a significantly higher percent of Cruiser shipments behind our model year 2016 product investments. 
On Slide 19, revenue for the Motorcycles segment was up in Q3 compared to last year, driven by 5.5% higher motorcycle shipments partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 5.2% and unfavorable mix. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $899 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Motorcycle and MSRP prices for our new 2016 model year motorcycles have increased by an average of about 1%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of costs is up about a half a percent expressed as a percent of revenue. Parts and Accessory revenue grew 5.2% behind strong new product sales, while General Merchandise revenue was down slightly. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
On Slide 20, gross margin in the quarter was 34.6% which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin was very strong during the quarter when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange which was $29.9 million unfavorable for the third quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies which devalued an average of 18% compared to the prior year. While manufacturing was unfavorable during the quarter, year-to-date manufacturing was favorable by $7.4 million behind strong productivity gains, partially offset by lower year-over-year production. Our gross margin performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. 
On Slide 21, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 12.5%, down 0.4 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to the consolidation of Canada and to our operations, partially offset by other favorabilities. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on an operating investment profile that will drive top line growth. Coupled with a continuous improvement mindset, we will drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 22. During the quarter, HDFS operating profit decreased 6.4% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the recent low rate promotional activity. The provision for retail loan losses was unfavorable to prior year due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in receivables. HDFS' third quarter operations are summarized on Slide 23. HDFS' retail loan originations increased 14.3% compared to last year's third quarter primarily driven by a 9.6 percentage point increase in our U.S. market share and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. The strong market share performance was driven by the third quarter promotional offers. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company. At the end of the quarter, we had $405 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had nearly $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. 
On Slide 24, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 3.16% or 16 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels. Annualized retail credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.19% compared to last year's third quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime origination in recent years as well as changing consumer behavior. During the third quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 25. I would like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $1.02 billion in the first 9 months of this year. Operating cash was up $54.1 million from last year driven by lower wholesale lending and lower working capital partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 26. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share. In addition, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $536 million. During the third quarter, we also began to execute our recapitalization plan. Details of the plan are on Slide 27. We successfully borrowed $750 million in a combination of both 10-year and 30-year notes. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and share -- repurchasing shares. 
Before I update our 2015 guidance on Slide 28, I want to discuss changes that we will make to the company's motorcycle operating investment profile in 2016 as that will have an impact on our Q4 and full year 2015 results. As Matt discussed, in 2016, we will significantly increase our investment to drive demand. We will source the funds by reallocating from our existing spending, primarily from support functions and through reorganization of our commercial operations aimed at being both leaner and stronger. And again, we expect to increase our investment in customer-facing marketing activities by approximately 65% from 2015 levels. We also expect to increase our investment in new product development by 35% from 2015 levels. As we prepare the organization for this new operating investment profile, we expect to incur one-time expenses in Q4 of 2015 of approximately $30 million to $35 million. These one-time expenses will largely consist of employee separation and reorganization costs. We expect the significant change will address the current competitive environment and will accelerate top line growth over the next several years. 
Now let's talk about guidance for the full year. For the full year 2015, we now expect to ship 265,000 to 270,000 motorcycles which is approximately flat to down 2% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship 47,000 to 52,000 motorcycles, which is approximately flat to up 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2015, we now believe operating margin for the Motorcycles segment will be between 16% and 17% compared to 18.0% in 2014. Our lower operating margin expectations are due to lower shipment expectations, one-time charges we expect in Q4 and increased recall expenses during the third quarter. In 2015, we continue to expect gross margin will be up modestly compared to 2014 impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect a favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and increased pension expense. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency is held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 0.75 percentage points.  As we look forward to 2016, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates through 2016, recognizing this as a hypothetical expectation in a very volatile exchange rate environment, we would expect approximately $45 million of additional unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact to gross margin as we lap the hedge benefits that we expect to realize in 2015. 
Looking at SG&A, excluding one-time charges we expect in Q4, we expect SG&A to be up in 2015 compared to last year. This includes the impact from the Canadian distributor transaction which occurred on August 4, 2015. The incremental SG&A impact of the Canadian transaction was approximately $10 million of increased expense in Q3. In Q4, we also expect approximately $10 million of SG&A expense related to Canadian operations. Our guidance for HDFS and CapEx remain unchanged. We now expect full year tax rate to be approximately 35% versus previously expected 35.5%. 
So that's the quarter. And while the results have fallen short of our expectations, we maintained a strong gross margin percent and delivered shareholder value through a $0.31 per share dividend and 536 million in share repurchases. But what's most important is what lies ahead. As Matt shared, we have a clear path forward and are making the investments we believe are necessary to drive demand and grow our business and achieve our goals. 
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. With that, we'll open it up to your questions."

Hoping you give some color on where specifically you're seeing the increased kind of competition from either the new competitive supply or the competition in EMEA. And then secondly, with the model year '16 bikes, how do you think those bikes are being perceived by both customers and dealers? And how does that play into this market share theme as well?"

In terms of market share in the United States, we were down 3.9%, pretty much in line with what we have seen over the last 4 quarters, and again, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw world currency shift and an incredible increase in overall competitive discounting. So that's a big portion of the 3.9 points of share loss. In addition, we've seen more competition in terms of new product. And also, probably the biggest driver of share loss in the quarter was from a new product called autocycles. That's included in the MIC numbers. And we do not believe that they compete head-to-head with motorcycles. It's a very different product. It's much more car-like. It has side-by-side seating, a gas pedal, a steering wheel, but it is classified in the MIC numbers. So the biggest piece of that share loss is coming from the inclusion of autocycles and the overall market share. The thing that we're most excited about is next quarter and the fourth quarter we start to lap on the beginning of, on the softness due to the competitive discounting, and so we'll have a little bit easier comps as we move into the fourth quarter and throughout next year. In terms of EMEA, it's been a highly competitive market there as well. That has not been driven by price competition as much as it has been in the U.S. In EMEA, it's really driven by a couple of new products. They are what we would call a middle-weight displacement in the 700 to 900 CC category and they're in the performance and standard segments. We compete in Cruisers and -- but these products have had a tremendous impact on the market. They've been very well-received and actually driving the year-to-date growth in the European market up 10%. And so first couple of quarters hit us pretty hard with regards to market share loss in Europe, much better in the third quarter. Retail sales turned positive, 2.4%. The European team is doing a great job, they came out with a couple of significant promotions, Custom Kings, which is a competition of personalizing and customizing our Street motorcycles, as well as King of Demos, and they've done a magnificent job in turning that around and we're very pleased with what we're seeing in the third quarter there. The last question that you asked, Kevin, is with regards to model year '16 motorcycles. We feel very good about the model year '16 launch and so do our dealers. Lot of times people compare everything going back to Rushmore, Rushmore was an incredible year for us and that about 15% of our volume and half our models were redone. And we're going to see those from time to time, but they're not going to be every year. And with that, our model year '16 was focused on our Cruiser bikes, and we added a tremendous amount of power to those bikes by adding our high output 103 engine. We added cruise control to Softails. And in addition, we added or significantly improved 5 models. There was 2 S models which include a 110 engine and they have sold extremely well, as well as a new Road Glide Ultra and 2 refreshes of our most popular Sportsters in Iron 883 and 48. And as you look at the quarter, we were very light on supply. Our supply could not meet the demand of those 5 models. We ended the quarter with about 1 bike per dealer in the U.S. in inventory. So still very light as we exited the quarter on inventory for those 5 models and that will be replenished in the fourth quarter."

And there's a couple of drivers of that, and one is the absorption on 11,000 units, which certainly affects our gross margin. Having said that, Craig, our gross margin we still expect to be up on a year-over-year basis. And I can't stress enough how important that is and how powerful the margin structure is at Harley-Davidson. So you look at gross margin, we're going to have well over $100-million hit in currency, which is 3/4 of a percentage point. We're going to have unfavorable mix as we invest in an incredibly powerful product such as Street, and we've also -- we'll have lower year-over-year production and, therefore, a headwind on production. And yet, still our gross margin is going to grow in 2015. And that's driven by the ability to price our products and the incredible productivities that we're driving out of the plants. So that will stay with us in 2015 and 2016 as we go forward. Also affecting operating margin this year is higher non-repeating SG&A expenses. So what we've got is 3 SG&A expenses that are affecting our overall guidance for the remainder of this year. One is the onetime expenses of $30 million to $35 million, and this is money spent to ready us for that new investment profile to significantly increase our investment and demand-driving activities into 2016 and beyond. The second is incorporation of Canada in the guidance. Remember, we didn't have that in our guidance after the second quarter, and we've talked about that being $0.04 dilutive, while that's all coming in the form of higher SG&A as we transition that business and size it, appropriately size it to gain the synergies out of us managing that market. And then the third piece of it is certainly unanticipated recall expense of $15 million in the third quarter. So you take the lower absorption and the SG&A. That's what's driving our gross margins to be down. So to answer your question, Craig, is the gross margin is incredibly strong and powerful, and that will continue to move into next year. We will have some headwinds on currency in 2016. But overall, very strong gross margin. And these things that we're talking about affecting operating margin are all non-repeating items."

So there's nothing from a cost perspective that you're seeing related to those changes, but they are significant. I would say that in my time here, we've never had a more significant view on all the things we need to do to assure quality. We enjoy incredible loyalty and incredible trust on the part of our riders. We will do nothing to violate that. It's incredibly valuable to us, and these recalls have been very disappointing to the company and to our riders and to our dealers. There's no question about it. I will say that there's nothing more important than the safety of our riders. They are not in -- sitting in cars with seatbelts and airbags and sheet metal around them. We understand immediately any safety implications that might exist with the quality problem. We get on it as quickly as we can, and we act decisively in the interest of the safety of our riders. And meanwhile, we're doing everything that we know, and we're bringing all sorts of outside expertise into auditing, assessing and advising us in what we need to do to get out of this state with these product quality issues that we've suffered. So again, it's -- there's nothing that is in the numbers that needs to be in the numbers, but there's an incredible amount of intensity going on within the business, and I think John, you -- he -- your..."

So that -- coming out of Q4 with the currency-driven, currency-enabled discounting and into Q1 and we started to see the impact on our business. And I'll tell you that, from my perspective, we've had a long-standing commitment, and it remains to manage supply in line with demand, that is to preserve the premium nature of the brand in the marketplace. And that is absolutely critical to us. However, it becomes -- I guess, the first quarter, in particular, started to really resonate with me from the standpoint of that's -- we're only talking about half the side of that equation. And what do we need to do as a business to drive demand? And so beginning really in Q2, we took action, we had a lot of early plans, we were a little bit behind the seasonality curve at that point in time. So it didn't have the effect that we expected, and we're driving forth for this year. But as I said in my opening remarks, it taught us a lot about what works, what doesn't work, and where we need to apply ourselves with more focus and more intensity to drive demand in a quality way globally for the long-term. So that's what we're about, and that's what we've been working on really through Q2 and in earnest, in Q3, and we will carry forward through Q4 with the restructuring to get ourselves fully set up to start really delivering in 2016. And I would say that from my perspective, this is a pivotal moment for the company. We've been talking for 6 years about transformation, and we're pivoting from transformation to driving demand. And that's Harley-Davidson at this point in time, in the midst of that pivot. So thanks for the question."

So we had talked about -- we started to get money out in the market in mid-May to the mid-June timeframe if you recall, and we had a three-pronged approach to doing that. And we saw very good results in the month of June. Month of June was up near double digit, both in the international markets as well as in the United States. And that momentum continued into July. A matter-of-fact, in July, we were ahead of our plan, our retail plan in July. And the growth continued into the first half of August. Started to get softer in the back half of August, and September was down. And so things were going according to plan until about halfway through the quarter, and they turned a little bit negative. And again, the spending that we did was effective, but certainly not sufficient given the headwinds that we faced. The comps also progressively got worse through the quarter as well, and than we had some issues with availability in the United States and certainly in our Asia Pacific markets, with inventories being down. When you looked at the U.S. inventory, while it finished up a little bit on a year-over-year basis, for 12 of the 13 weeks, it was down quite a bit. And a lot of that time up to down 10%. So that puts some pressure on in the United States, and certainly with the new products that we came out with, for those 5 models, the demand outstripped our ability to supply those. And again, still a little bit light on those inventories as we move into the fourth quarter. And in addition, the recalls that we had, we had 2 recalls in the middle of the quarter, and they had an impact on some of our parts. In particular, on our Street motorcycles, a fuel pump, we couldn't produce them fast enough. And we're essentially -- dealers weren't selling motorcycles. Street motorcycles were up to 6 weeks during the third quarter. The biggest impact of that was in Asia Pacific. Even though Asia Pacific was still up, it was certainly hindered by a lack of selling Street motorcycles for a period of that time. Inventories are back with regards to the Street and looking forward to a better fourth quarter."

How are we going to take the $70 million or the 65% increase in customer-facing marketing and drive demand? Part of it is, is through awareness. And you're absolutely right, Sharon, is a lot of this is through the brotherhood of riding and so on and so forth. But the fact of the matter is, is our share of voice has never been close to our share of market, and that's one of the benefits that we get of having one of the world's most powerful brands. However in the last couple of years, we have seen an incredible amount of marketing dollars coming in into the market and has been diluting our share of voice a bit. Just take the discounting, for example. I mean, the tens and tens of millions of dollars of discounts are all being advertised throughout the United States, and so we've lost a little bit on share of voice as well as the new products. So we are going to get that share of voice back, and yes, we've got tremendous things to talk about in terms of our new products and the products and the experiences that we offer, and we have fallen a little bit behind in that in terms of us being front and center. In terms of growing the ridership in the United States, Matt, this is actually getting back to your first question. What's worked very well is things like the Military Rider Academy -- or I'm sorry, free rider training. The response has been way in excess of our expectations. We've now got a quarter behind us on this, and we're getting thousands of people through the Rider Academy program, and we're starting to see the fruits of that pay off in a conversion rate which is better than what we typically see with the military going through and ultimately buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. So what's better than that, that somebody that's never ridden, we're bringing him into the sport of motorcycling, and getting him on a Harley-Davidson. So those types of things are what we're going to do a lot more of next year, and you're going to see a lot more of that type of investment. When we look at things that maybe didn't go as well, I wouldn't say [indiscernible] as well but they were much more short-term in nature. For example, the financing. The financing drove incremental sales in the early part of the quarter -- or I'm sorry, the beginning of the quarter, and we expected that, and it did that. However, there is certainly diminishing returns on that type of investment, and we never intended for that to go into our model year '16 motorcycles. And so the financing ended with a new model year, and again, that's not the way to build into the future is training customers for discounts. But it does. It is an important tool, and it provided an opportunity for us to clear out some of the model year '15s. So we've learned from all of those things. We're going to do a lot more of the things that worked next year, and we're going to bring more importantly a tremendous amount more of resources to do that, and we're also organizing our company to be much more demand-focused in how we go-to-market with our dealers and our customers."

When we talk about looking forward 2016 and what we expect in terms of the delivery of the dollars in marketing and certainly the product is, number one, as we look at next year, much easier comps. So that starts it, but model year '16 and '17 is certainly going to drive volume for us, the continued rollout of Street, outreach growth. Through the year-to-date, outreach is up 7%. Even overall volumes are down. We've been very successful in that avenue and continue that in 2016. And then finally, international expansion. This quarter alone, we put up 14 dealerships internationally, which is a 2% increase in our overall international dealerships. And as Matt mentioned upfront, is we look to put up 15 to 20 -- 150 to 200 new dealerships over the next 5 years, which represents a 20% to 25% increase in our international dealerships. So with all of that, we expect growth in 2016, and while we don't provide our guidance until January, I think you can expect that you'll see in the neighborhood of 3% to 5% shipment growth as we look to 2016. On the next question you asked is with regards to financing. It is very difficult that the pullout -- how much exactly is driven by the financing piece. When we initiated those projects, the successes and the take rate is very high. You can see our market share at HDFS was 70% in the quarter, certainly driven by an increased amount of financing. Difficult part is to see how much of those are incremental units. Again, at the onset, we felt it certainly drove some of the performance that we had in the first part of the quarter and -- but again, not the way we want to go forward as training folks to buy on finance promos."

We're able to shift demand from the 49 states back to California specification motorcycles during the spring season when demand was far ahead of our expectations there versus the rest of the country.

Last quarter, I talked about my confidence in the strength of the business, our strategies and our team. Today, despite some disappointing results, but thanks to a lot of great strategy and planning work we've done over the last several months, I'm even more confident we have the foundation, plan and team in place to compete to win and lead in the marketplace. I'll talk more about our forward view and actions in a minute, but first, I want to share some perspectives on our quarter and year so far. 
You've read the results in this morning's press release, and it goes without saying the quarter and the year-to-date did not unfold the way we expected. The marketplace has thrown us some curveballs this year and competition has ramped up, whether it's a currency-driven advantage for competitors in the U.S. or new products from competitors in EMEA. We've also had some headwinds of our own making such as product availability and voluntary recalls. We fully recognize we have to raise our game. We challenged our playbook, acted to drive demand, reallocated spending and fast-tracked initiatives. Some of our actions like the U.S. Military Learn To Ride initiative and the rollout of our new 2016 models hit the mark and stimulated demand. Some of our actions did less than we expected, but the bottom line on Q3 is our performance did not meet our expectations. We know we can do better, and we will. 
Moving forward, we're taking what we've learned and are applying it. We continue to refine our investments and sharpen our resolve. And that's why I'm more confident now than ever in our ability to compete and win. Part of this confidence comes from the nature of the successes we did see and part of it rests on the incredible foundation already in place and our plans to take it to the next level. In short, we're going to dial things up. 
As you know, 6 years ago, we introduced our plan to grow our reach and impact with more customers globally. To do so, we committed to do what it took to be great at our core work of product development, manufacturing and retail. Today, much of that work is complete with fine-tuning ongoing. We have incredible strengths that we can leverage and maximize. We know how to develop great customer-led products and get them to market in world-class time, and we will do even more in this area. We know how to manufacture to effectively meet dynamic global customer demand. We know what customers expect at retail, and our industry-leading dealers are equipped to provide best-in-class customer experiences. 
We have a tremendous brand that ignites passion in every one of our customers, and most importantly, we've proven that our strong appeal with U.S. core customers extends to every one of our U.S. outreach segments and to our international customers in both developed and emerging markets. As we look to the future, our plan to grow our reach and impact with customers globally has not changed. And at their core, our focus areas, I'll be talking about today are natural extensions of the strong foundations we have in place. So let's talk about our path ahead. 
We've got 5 clear objectives. One, lead in every market. This means achieving and holding the #1 share of the 601+CC Motorcycle segment. This is not just about competing but winning. This is the objective we're all most energized by. Two, grow the sport of motorcycling in the United States, in part by growing the number of U.S. core customers and growing U.S. outreach customers at a faster rate. We're already making great progress in this area as we have more than doubled the rate of growth in sales to outreach customers versus sales to core customers in each of the last 4 years and are on track to do so this year as well. Three, grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate. We have a target to grow the international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Four, grow revenue and grow earnings faster than revenue through 2020. And finally, outperform the S&P 500. So those are the objectives. Now let's talk about how we plan to achieve them in a market environment we expect will continue to be highly competitive. 
A minute ago, I talked about dialing things up. But I don't mean just for a quarter or a year. Now is the time for incremental investment to drive demand. For 2016 and beyond, we've challenged ourselves to reallocate existing spending into demand-driving investments in both customer-facing marketing and new product development. In 2016, we'll increase our investment in customer-facing marketing by approximately 65% above 2015 levels. We also plan to increase our investment in new product development by approximately 35% from 2015 levels. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our commitment to new products, we had already substantially increased our investment this year in new product development, which means that our planned investment for 2016 in the next several years will be nearly twice what it was in just 2014. In dollar terms, these investments in product development and marketing represent an approximate $70 million increase in our investment to drive demand compared to 2015. 
Our investments will be focused in 4 key areas: First, increasing product and brand awareness. Second, growing new ridership in the United States. Third, increasing and enhancing brand access. And finally, accelerating the cadence and impact of new products. 
Now let's talk about each one in turn, starting with product and brand awareness. We've got fantastic, industry-leading products and there's more to come. We can do more to let people know about them, whether it's with people who aspire to take up riding, riders of competitive brands or existing customers who can trade up to a new Harley-Davidson model that has even more of the latest features and technology. Next, grow new ridership in the United States. We know the importance of bringing new riders into the brand and into the sport of motorcycling. One of the key ways to grow ridership is to make it easier for people to learn to ride. We've already seen great success with our Harley-Davidson Riding Academy, training more than 220,000 riders worldwide since 2010. With the rebranding of our program and the opportunity to Learn To Ride on a Harley-Davidson Street 500, along with the launch of the U.S. military rider training initiative, we've grown our rider training by 25% over 2014. We've created a pipeline to riding and we're going to do even more by expanding on our successful programs. 
We're set to more than double the numbers of riders trained annually through the Riding Academy to over 100,000 globally by 2020, with the majority in the United States. The third area of focus is to increase and enhance brand access, increasing customer touch points with Harley-Davidson. First and foremost, this is about continuing to expand and enhance our incredibly strong global dealer network, which provides one of the greatest competitive differentiators for our brand through the service and experiences they deliver. As I shared, we have a target to grow our international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Beyond traditional dealerships, we're developing new retail formats for urban centers and urban tastes. eCommerce expansion is also key. 
Currently, Harley-Davidson products are available via eCommerce in the U.S., India and China, but look for more markets to come. Importantly, we'll also accelerate the cadence and impact of new products and extend our leadership in the features and technologies that matter to customers. Things like link brakes, engine performance and environmental enhancements, aerodynamics and electric vehicle technology. Project Rushmore bikes and Project LiveWire are great early examples of our capability and resolve to deliver technology and innovation to inspire our riders. I won't go into details about what's coming down the pipeline, but there will be a steady drumbeat ranging from product updates and refreshes to new products and meaningful technology, including new engines and all new motorcycles from the ground up too. 
So there you have it. We're committed to dialing up our strengths in growing Harley-Davidson by increasing our reach and impact. All of this will require smart and strong plans, agility, accountability and commitment from our entire team. We're ready and we're committed, and we know as we show with manufacturing and product development, that when we're all committed, we do amazing things. I want to be crystal clear, the path forward will play out over a number of years. This isn't about improving results for a quarter or even a year. This is about where we want to be in 3 years, 5 years and even 10 years. We'll continue to build on our plans, adapt and adjust as we need to. 
So as I wrap up my comments, I hope you've noticed a common theme: market leadership. The path we're on is all about asserting our already substantial leadership in the industry and continuing to drive sustainable growth well into the future. We're going to lead and compete with clear purpose and intent. We're going to lead boldly and unapologetically. We're not just going to compete, we're here to win. With that, I'll turn it over to John. John?"
277444,311848742,878286,"Harley-Davidson, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2015",2015-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Harley-Davidson, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results following the press release and slides. The summary of our third quarter financial results starts on Slide 14. During the quarter, revenue was $1.32 billion, net income was",2333,"Thanks, Matt. Today, I'll provide additional insight around our financial results following the press release and slides. The summary of our third quarter financial results starts on Slide 14. During the quarter, revenue was $1.32 billion, net income was $140.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69, all achieved in an incredibly challenging environment. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was down 2.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Motorcycles segment gross margin continued to be very strong despite unfavorable currency impact. The Motorcycle business operating margin percent was down slightly driven by lower gross margin and slightly higher SG&A spending. At HDFS, operating income was down 6.4% year-over-year. The quarter also reflected higher corporate interests expense resulting from our recent recapitalization plan. Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to focus on delivering strong margins and strong returns over the long term. 
Now let's look at retail sales on Slide 15. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.4% in the third quarter. Retail sales were below our expectations, and as a result, we are adjusting our full-year shipment guidance down by 11,000 motorcycles. We now expect to ship between 265,000 and 270,000 motorcycles, approximately flat to down 2% versus prior year. It is critical for Harley-Davidson to manage supply in line with demand and protect our brand premium. Looking forward, we expect to return to growth as we benefit from our new 2016 model year motorcycles, increased investment in demand driving actions, improved product availability and the overall strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. 
Turning to the U.S. on Slide 16, third quarter retail sales were down 2.5%, adversely impacted by continued intense competitive activity, lapping the enthusiastic Rushmore response, and limited availability on certain models. These significant challenges were partially offset by our market response actions initiated in the second quarter. While we believe these actions were effective, they were not sufficient given the headwinds we faced in the U.S. 
During the quarter, the U.S. industry grew 4.5%. We had a very strong market share leadership share position of 52.4%, and we believe the industry's robust growth during the quarter is a sign of industry strength going forward. However, our Q3 market share was down 3.9 percentage points versus prior year. While we anticipated some level of share loss following the 13.4 points of market share gains in recent years, our market share over the last 4 quarters was more severely impacted than we expected as a result of the competitive environment and the inclusion of autocycles in the industry numbers. Dealers' retail inventories were consistently below prior year levels throughout the quarter, which adversely affected product availability on certain models. Inventories recovered by quarter end and finished the quarter up slightly to prior year. We continue to expect year-end retail inventories to be flat to slightly -- to up slightly compared to last year, reflecting the incremental new models launched in the 2016 model year. 
On Slide 17, retail sales in our international markets were up 0.9% in the third quarter. In the EMEA region, retail sales were up despite the impact of new models introduced by competitive brands and currency-driven volume declines in markets where we sell our motorcycles to dealers in nonlocal currencies. Year-to-date, Europe market share was down 1.6 percentage points behind the impact of new low-price models and the performance and standard segments, market segments where we do not compete. In the Asia-Pacific region, emerging markets continue to experience growth. However, retail sales in the region were negatively impacted as a result of very limited availability of Street motorcycles in August and early September, following a voluntary recall initiated in July. The supply of Street motorcycles was largely restored by the end of the quarter. 
Latin America region retail sales were down in the quarter as a result of soft retail sales in Brazil behind a weak economy, consumer uncertainty and aggressive price competition. Brazil declines were partially offset by strong growth in Mexico. Finally, retail sales in Canada were down modestly in a highly competitive environment. We believe the market responded well to the change to a direct distribution model, which took effect at the beginning of August and to a reduction in pricing with model year 2016 motorcycles. Despite the volatility in global retail sales, we believe we can continue to realize international growth by expanding our distribution network, building on our brand experience across the world and delivering exceptional products that inspire riders.
On Slide 18, wholesale motorcycle shipments in the quarter were up 5.5% compared to last year, but slightly below our expected range of 54,000 to 59,000 motorcycles in response to the lower-than-expected retail sales during the quarter. The overall shipment mix reflects a significantly higher percent of Cruiser shipments behind our model year 2016 product investments. 
On Slide 19, revenue for the Motorcycles segment was up in Q3 compared to last year, driven by 5.5% higher motorcycle shipments partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange which reduced revenue by approximately 5.2% and unfavorable mix. During the quarter, the average motorcycle revenue per unit decreased $899 from the year-ago quarter behind unfavorable currency exchange and product mix, partially offset by higher pricing. Motorcycle and MSRP prices for our new 2016 model year motorcycles have increased by an average of about 1%. After adjusting for the cost of new content, pricing net of costs is up about 0.5% expressed as a percent of revenue. Parts and Accessory revenue grew 5.2% behind strong new product sales, while General Merchandise revenue was down slightly. Both P&A and General Merchandise revenues were adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 
On Slide 20, gross margin in the quarter was 34.6% which was 0.3 percentage points lower than last year. Gross margin was very strong during the quarter when considering the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange which was $29.9 million unfavorable for the third quarter. This was driven by the significant year-over-year weakening of our key foreign currencies which devalued an average of 18% compared to the prior year. While manufacturing was unfavorable during the quarter, year-to-date manufacturing was favorable by $7.4 million behind strong productivity gains, partially offset by lower year-over-year production. Our gross margin performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis is evidence of our strong underlying margin structure and flexible manufacturing capability. 
On Slide 21, operating margin as a percent of revenue for the third quarter was 12.5%, down 0.4 percentage points compared to last year. SG&A spending in the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis due to the consolidation of Canada into our operations, partially offset by other favorabilities. Going forward, we remain intensely focused on an operating investment profile that will drive top line growth. Coupled with a continuous improvement mindset, we will drive our business to be stronger, more flexible and more profitable. 
Now let's take a look at our Financial Services segment on Slide 22. During the quarter, HDFS operating profit decreased 6.4% compared to last year. Net interest income was favorable to prior year driven by higher receivables partially offset by lower yields on receivables due in part to the recent low rate promotional activity. The provision for retail loan losses was unfavorable to prior year due to higher retail credit losses and an increase in receivables. 
HDFS's third quarter operations are summarized on Slide 23. HDFS's retail loan originations increased 14.3% compared to last year's third quarter primarily driven by a 9.6 percentage point increase in our U.S. market share and a higher average amount financed per motorcycle. The strong market share performance was driven by the third quarter promotional offers. On a year-to-date basis, loan originations were comprised of approximately 80% prime loans and 20% subprime. As a predominant lender to subprime customers, these originations represent a significant amount of retail sales to the company at very attractive returns, which further reinforces the competitive advantage that HDFS brings to the company. At the end of the quarter, we had $405 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS. In addition, HDFS had nearly $1 billion of available liquidity through bank credit and conduit facilities. 
On Slide 24, you'll see the 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at the end of the quarter was 3.16% or 16 basis points higher than the same period last year. Delinquency rates across the portfolio continued to perform at near record low levels. Annualized retail credit losses increased by 11 basis points to 1.19% compared to last year's third quarter, driven by modestly higher credit losses in line with increased subprime origination in recent years as well as changing consumer behavior. During the third quarter, HDFS continued to maintain a strong liquidity position and contributed strong profitability. HDFS remains focused on enabling sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles while providing attractive return to Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Remaining Harley-Davidson, Inc. financial results are summarized on Slide 25. I would like to highlight that the company generated operating cash of $1.02 billion in the first 9 months of this year. Operating cash was up $54.1 million from last year driven by lower wholesale lending and lower working capital partially offset by lower net income. The company currently has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and/or committed credit facilities. 
Now switching our focus to shareholder value on Slide 26. Returning value to our shareholders is a top priority. You will see that during the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.31 per share. In addition, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $536 million. During the third quarter, we also began to execute our recapitalization plan. Details of the plan are on Slide 27. We successfully borrowed $750 million in a combination of both 10-year and 30-year notes. As we move forward, we will invest to grow the business and improve overall performance, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders through increasing dividends and share -- repurchasing shares. 
Before I update our 2015 guidance on Slide 28, I want to discuss changes that we will make to the company's motorcycle operating investment profile in 2016 as that will have an impact on our Q4 and full year 2015 results. As Matt discussed, in 2016, we will significantly increase our investment to drive demand. We will source the funds by reallocating from our existing spending, primarily from support functions and through reorganization of our commercial operations aimed at being both leaner and stronger. And again, we expect to increase our investment in customer-facing marketing activities by approximately 65% from 2015 levels. 
We also expect to increase our investment in new product development by 35% from 2015 levels. As we prepare the organization for this new operating investment profile, we expect to incur one-time expenses in Q4 of 2015 of approximately $30 million to $35 million. These one-time expenses will largely consist of employee separation and reorganization costs. We expect the significant change will address the current competitive environment and will accelerate top line growth over the next several years. 
Now let's talk about guidance for the full year. For the full year 2015, we now expect to ship 265,000 to 270,000 motorcycles which is approximately flat to down 2% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we expect to ship 47,000 to 52,000 motorcycles, which is approximately flat to up 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. For 2015, we now believe operating margin for the Motorcycles segment will be between 16% and 17% compared to 18.0% in 2014. Our lower operating margin expectations are due to lower shipment expectations, one-time charges we expect in Q4 and increased recall expenses during the third quarter. 
In 2015, we continue to expect gross margin will be up modestly compared to 2014 impacted by both puts and takes. On the positive side, we expect a favorable impact from motorcycle pricing and strong productivity gains. On the negative side, we expect gross margin will be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and increased pension expense. To dimensionalize the foreign currency exchange risk, if currency is held at yesterday's exchange rates for the remainder of 2015, our full year Motorcycles segment revenue would be adversely impacted by approximately 4.25%. Taking into account our natural hedges and the fact that we have a significant portion of the year hedged, we would expect about half of the unfavorable revenue dollar impact to translate into lower gross margin for the full year, reducing gross margin by approximately 0.75 percentage points. 
As we look forward to 2016, assuming that currencies hold at yesterday's exchange rates through 2016, recognizing this as a hypothetical expectation in a very volatile exchange rate environment, we would expect approximately $45 million of additional unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact to gross margin as we lap the hedge benefits that we expect to realize in 2015. 
Looking at SG&A, excluding one-time charges we expect in Q4, we expect SG&A to be up in 2015 compared to last year. This includes the impact from the Canadian distributor transaction which occurred on August 4, 2015. The incremental SG&A impact of the Canadian transaction was approximately $10 million of increased expense in Q3. In Q4, we also expect approximately $10 million of SG&A expense related to Canadian operations. Our guidance for HDFS and CapEx remain unchanged. We now expect full year tax rate to be approximately 35% versus previously expected 35.5%. 
So that's the quarter. And while the results have fallen short of our expectations, we maintained a strong gross margin percent and delivered shareholder value through a $0.31 per share dividend and 536 million in share repurchases. But what's most important is what lies ahead. As Matt shared, we have a clear path forward and are making the investments we believe are necessary to drive demand and grow our business and achieve our goals. 
Thank you for your continued confidence and investment in Harley-Davidson. With that, we'll open it up to your questions."

Obviously, the competitive environment is pretty clear to all of us, but you called out the new product introductions by competitors. Hoping you can give some color on where specifically you're seeing the increased kind of competition from either the new competitive supply or the competition in EMEA.

In terms of market share in the United States, we were down 3.9%, pretty much in line with what we have seen over the last 4 quarters, and again, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw world currency shift and an incredible increase in overall competitive discounting. So that's a big portion of the 3.9 points of share loss. In addition, we've seen more competition in terms of new product. And also, probably the biggest driver of share loss in the quarter was from a new product called autocycles. That's included in the MIC numbers. And we do not believe that they compete head-to-head with motorcycles. It's a very different product. It's much more car-like. It has side-by-side seating, a gas pedal, a steering wheel, but it is classified in the MIC numbers. So the biggest piece of that share loss is coming from the inclusion of autocycles and the overall market share. The thing that we're most excited about is next quarter and the fourth quarter we start to lap on the beginning of, on the softness due to the competitive discounting, and so we'll have a little bit easier comps as we move into the fourth quarter and throughout next year. In terms of EMEA, it's been a highly competitive market there as well. That has not been driven by price competition as much as it has been in the U.S. In EMEA, it's really driven by a couple of new products. They are what we would call a middle-weight displacement in the 700 to 900 CC category and they're in the performance and standard segments. We compete in Cruisers and -- but these products have had a tremendous impact on the market. They've been very well-received and actually driving the year-to-date growth in the European market up 10%. And so first couple of quarters hit us pretty hard with regards to market share loss in Europe, much better in the third quarter. Retail sales turned positive, 2.4%. The European team is doing a great job, they came out with a couple of significant promotions, Custom Kings, which is a competition of personalizing and customizing our Street motorcycles, as well as King of Demos [ph], and they've done a magnificent job in turning that around and we're very pleased with what we're seeing in the third quarter there. The last question that you asked, Kevin, is with regards to model year '16 motorcycles. We feel very good about the model year '16 launch and so do our dealers. Lot of times people compare everything going back to Rushmore, Rushmore was an incredible year for us and that about 15% of our volume and half our models were redone. And we're going to see those from time to time, but they're not going to be every year. And with that, our model year '16 was focused on our Cruiser bikes, and we added a tremendous amount of power to those bikes by adding our high output 103 engine. We added cruise control to Softails. And in addition, we added or significantly improved 5 models. There was 2 S models which include a 110 engine and they have sold extremely well, as well as a new Road Glide Ultra and 2 refreshes of our most popular Sportsters in Iron 883 and Forty-Eight. And as you look at the quarter, we were very light on supply. Our supply could not meet the demand of those 5 models. We ended the quarter with about 1 bike per dealer in the U.S. in inventory. So still very light as we exited the quarter on inventory for those 5 models and that will be replenished in the fourth quarter."

And there's a couple of drivers of that, and one is the absorption on 11,000 units, which certainly affects our gross margin. Having said that, Craig, our gross margin we still expect to be up on a year-over-year basis. And I can't stress enough how important that is and how powerful the margin structure is at Harley-Davidson. So you look at gross margin, we're going to have well over $100-million hit in currency, which is 0.75 percentage point. We're going to have unfavorable mix as we invest in an incredibly powerful product such as Street, and we've also -- we'll have lower year-over-year production and, therefore, a headwind on production. And yet, still our gross margin is going to grow in 2015. And that's driven by the ability to price our products and the incredible productivities that we're driving out of the plants. So that will stay with us in 2015 and 2016 as we go forward. Also affecting operating margin this year is higher non-repeating SG&A expenses. So what we've got is 3 SG&A expenses that are affecting our overall guidance for the remainder of this year. One is the onetime expenses of $30 million to $35 million, and this is money spent to ready us for that new investment profile to significantly increase our investment in demand-driving activities into 2016 and beyond. The second is incorporation of Canada in the guidance. Remember, we didn't have that in our guidance after the second quarter, and we've talked about that being $0.04 dilutive, while that's all coming in the form of higher SG&A as we transition that business and size it, appropriately size it to gain the synergies out of us managing that market. And then the third piece of it is certainly unanticipated recall expense of $15 million in the third quarter. So you take the lower absorption and the SG&A. That's what's driving our gross margins to be down. So to answer your question, Craig, is the gross margin is incredibly strong and powerful, and that will continue to move into next year, we will have some headwinds on currency in 2016. But overall, very strong gross margin. And these things that we're talking about affecting operating margin are all non-repeating items."

We enjoy incredible loyalty and incredible trust on the part of our riders. We will do nothing to violate that. It's incredibly valuable to us, and these recalls have been very disappointing to the company and to our riders and to our dealers. There's no question about it. I will say that there's nothing more important than the safety of our riders. They are not in -- sitting in cars with seatbelts and airbags and sheet metal around them. We understand immediately any safety implications that might exist with the quality problem. We get on it as quickly as we can, and we act decisively in the interest of the safety of our riders.

And what do we need to do as a business to drive demand? And so beginning really in Q2, we took action, we had a lot of early plans, we were a little bit behind the seasonality curve at that point in time. So it didn't have the effect that we expected, and we're driving forth for this year.

What were you seeing back then that made you feel like things were going to get a lot better in the second half? Obviously, they got worse, but I guess another way to look at that, I mean, June, end of June, I think you talked about being really strong. Did numbers fall off a cliff from there?

So we had talked about -- we started to get money out in the market in mid-May to the mid-June timeframe if you recall, and we had a 3-pronged approach to doing that. And we saw very good results in the month of June. Month of June was up near double digit, both in the international markets as well as in the United States. And that momentum continued into July. A matter-of-fact, in July, we were ahead of our plan, our retail plan in July. And the growth continued into the first half of August. Started to get softer in the back half of August, and September was down. And so things were going according to plan until about halfway through the quarter, and they turned a little bit negative. And again, the spending that we did was effective, but certainly not sufficient given the headwinds that we faced. The comps also progressively got worse through the quarter as well, and then we had some issues with availability in the United States and certainly in our Asia-Pacific markets, with inventories being down. When you looked at the U.S. inventory, while it finished up a little bit on a year-over-year basis, for 12 of the 13 weeks, it was down quite a bit. And a lot of that time up to down 10%. So that put some pressure on in the United States, and certainly with the new products that we came out with, for those 5 models, the demand outstripped our ability to supply those. And again, still a little bit light on those inventories as we move into the fourth quarter. And in addition, the recalls that we had, we had 2 recalls in the middle of the quarter, and they had an impact on some of our parts. In particular, on our Street motorcycles, a fuel pump, we couldn't produce them fast enough. And we're essentially -- dealers weren't selling motorcycles -- Street motorcycles were up to 6 weeks during the third quarter. The biggest impact of that was in Asia-Pacific. Even though Asia-Pacific was still up, it was certainly hindered by a lack of selling Street motorcycles for a period of that time. Inventories are back with regards to the Street and looking forward to a better fourth quarter."

How are we going to take the $70 million or the 65% increase in customer-facing marketing and drive demand? Part of it is, is through awareness. And you're absolutely right, Sharon, is a lot of this is through the brotherhood of riding and so on and so forth. But the fact of the matter is, is our share of voice has never been close to our share of market, and that's one of the benefits that we get of having one of the world's most powerful brands. However in the last couple of years, we have seen an incredible amount of marketing dollars coming in into the market and has been diluting our share of voice a bit. Just take the discounting, for example. I mean, the tens and tens of millions of dollars of discounts are all being advertised throughout the United States, and so we've lost a little bit on share of voice as well as the new products. So we are going to get that share of voice back, and yes, we've got tremendous things to talk about in terms of our new products and the products and the experiences that we offer, and we have fallen a little bit behind in that in terms of us being front and center. In terms of growing the ridership in the United States, I'm actually getting back to your first question, what's worked very well is things like the Military Rider Academy -- or I'm sorry, free rider training. The response has been way in excess of our expectations. We've now got a quarter behind us on this, and we're getting thousands of people through the Rider Academy program, and we're starting to see the fruits of that pay off in a conversion rate which is better than what we typically see with the military going through and ultimately buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. So what's better than that, that somebody that's never ridden, we're bringing him into the sport of motorcycling, and getting him on a Harley-Davidson. So those types of things are what we're going to do a lot more of next year, and you're going to see a lot more of that type of investment. When we look at things that maybe didn't go as well, I wouldn't say as go as well but they were much more short-term in nature. For example, the financing. The financing drove incremental sales in the early part of the quarter -- or I'm sorry, the beginning of the quarter, and we expected that, and it did that. However, there is certainly diminishing returns on that type of investment, and we never intended for that to go into our model year '16 motorcycles. And so the financing ended with a new model year, and again, that's not the way to build into the future is training customers for discounts. But it does. It is an important tool, and it provided an opportunity for us to clear out some of the model year '15s. So we've learned from all of those things. We're going to do a lot more of the things that worked next year, and we're going to bring more importantly a tremendous amount more of resources to do that, and we're also organizing our company to be much more demand-focused in how we go-to-market with our dealers and our customers."

When we talk about looking forward 2016 and what we expect in terms of the delivery of the dollars in marketing and certainly the product is, number one, as we look at next year, much easier comps. So that starts it, but model year '16 and '17 is certainly going to drive volume for us, the continued rollout of Street, outreach growth. Through the year-to-date, outreach is up 7%. Even overall volumes are down, we've been very successful in that avenue and continue that in 2016. And then finally, international expansion. This quarter alone, we put up 14 dealerships internationally, which is a 2% increase in our overall international dealerships. And as Matt mentioned upfront, is we look to put up 15 to 20 -- 150 to 200 new dealerships over the next 5 years, which represents a 20% to 25% increase in our international dealerships. So with all of that, we expect growth in 2016, and while we don't provide our guidance until January, I think you can expect that you'll see in the neighborhood of 3% to 5% shipment growth as we look to 2016. The next question you asked is with regards to financing. It is very difficult that the pullout -- how much exactly is driven by the financing piece. When we initiated those projects, the successes and the take rate is very high. You can see our market share at HDFS was 70% in the quarter, certainly driven by an increased amount of financing. Difficult part is to see how much of those are incremental units. Again, at the onset, we felt it certainly drove some of the performance that we had in the first part of the quarter and -- but again, not the way we want to go forward as training folks to buy on finance promos."

The dealer network is absolutely an integral part in every market, not just the United States. So our -- part of our plans and approach include how do we engage the dealer network and continue to engage, quite frankly, the dealer network in the right way to identify customers, nurture, develop, serve and support those customers. And John's comment about outreach is actually a great example of in the U.S., the capability of the dealers growing over the last several years to understand that there's a whole world of people out there that are interested in Harley-Davidson, what we stand for as a company, how to talk to them, how to work with them, how to engage them and continue to keep them in the family. So we -- our dealers, as I mentioned in my comments, are second to none in the industry, just fantastic, they're committed. What more we can do with them is absolutely part of our plans."

The rollout of Street began late in the fourth quarter of last year. Remember, we started out with 4 initial markets late in the fourth quarter of last year in Europe and then throughout the first half of this year, largely in Europe -- I'm sorry, in Asia-Pacific markets. And we couldn't be more pleased with the way that's going. To pick a couple of examples, Street is the #1 selling motorcycle in Australia, the #1 selling motorcycle in India. When you move around the globe, it's #2 in Mexico. In EMEA, it's #6 most popular selling motorcycle. In the United States, it's #13. And again, to put it in context in the United States, there is no other cruiser by any competitive -- competitor out there that's selling more than Street in the United States, again, to give you an example of the size and the ability to bring new people in on that bike. So we couldn't be more pleased with the overall rollout of Street. We do have a little bit of lapping of opportunity in the first half of next year in terms of Street growth."

I actually think John's comments about the performance and manufacturing are an absolute confirmation of the strength of the system that we built. We've been able to read markets, not just globally, but in internal to the United States in the spring as weather unfolded differently than we expected. For example, California is an entirely different specification that we build. So it is, in effect, feels like a different country to us from a manufacturing perspective. We're able to shift demand from the 49 states back to California specification motorcycles during the spring season when demand was far ahead of our expectations there versus the rest of the country. So to be able to do all that and deliver these kind of gross margins in down volume years and stuff is an absolute testament to the strength and the capability."
