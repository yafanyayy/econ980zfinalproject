We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continue to execute on our long-term strategy designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, while continually improving return on invested capital. 
Some of our financial highlights for the quarter and full year include: fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50. This result includes a $0.02 benefit from the extension of CNG fuel tax credits. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.96 and adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. Both performance metrics were in line with the full year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.2% and average yield was 1.7%. This is our highest level of average yield in the last 4 years. Fourth quarter volumes increased 1.6%. Volume growth continues to be concentrated to construction and demolition waste. We returned approximately $780 million total cash to shareholders during the year, which represents a cash yield of 6%. This includes 11 million shares repurchased for $400 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 24.7%. The highest level in the waste industry and well above the S&P 500 average. 
Throughout 2014, we discussed our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to properly grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. I will now recap our progress made during the year.
14% of our fleet is operating on natural gas. During 2014, we added 7 CNG fueling stations and now operate a total of 36. We increased the automated portion of our residential fleet to 69% from 66% in the prior year. During 2014, we certified 14% of the fleet under our One Fleet Maintenance program, approximately 60% of our fleet has been certified since inception. Some of the benefits we are seeing in our One Fleet divisions include: 1% to 2% lower maintenance cost per engine hour; 2% greater fleet reliability; 20% fewer unscheduled repairs; and 50% lower technician turnover. We continue to make investments in recycling facilities to improve productivity and increase capabilities, while rationalizing under performing assets. We closed 7 older recycling facilities that were not earning an adequate return during 2014. We invested $231 million to acquire 132 million of solid waste revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5.6x. This included the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal, a high-quality franchise business that complements our Southern California operations. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Turbid LLC for approximately $485 million. The acquisition of provides a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. EMP waste sector and unites an experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We believe the MP waste sector provides attractive long-term growth opportunities and leverages our expertise in waste handling recovery and disposal. The assets are well-positioned with approximately 80% of the revenue generated in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basins. We expect the deal to close this month. 
During 2014, we entered or  we heightened our focus on our customers to differentiate our service offering. Good customer loyalty and increased willingness to pay. For example, we launched the My Resource customer portal which gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. Over 500,000 customers have enrolled to date. We launched the My Resource mobile app, an expansion of our customer's online management tool. The Apple else customers to schedule services and received push notifications using a mobile device. We implemented the tablet-based capture pricing tool which creates a more professional sales experience and helps realize better pricing levels at the point-of-sale. This rollout is complete in 17 of our 20 areas. And we launched priority-based selling or PBS, which enables us to identify and segment customers buying priorities and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. We expect that PBS will be fully implemented by the end of 2015. 
I'm proud of our many achievements during 2014, which are reflected in our strong performance. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on the residential business. Last quarter, we discussed the action is we are taking to improve performance. Since then, we have engaged many of our municipal customers we've made good progress. Most of our municipal partners want a pricing mechanism that is fair for both parties and understand low CPE space resets have not kept pace with cost increases over the last 6 years. We have continued to educate municipalities and expanded the use of indexes published by their Bureau of Labor Statistics that more closely align with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. We are very early in the process but remain encouraged by our initial results. The remainder of our business continues to perform well and is generating strong year-over-year increases in revenue and EBITDA. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which excluded Bridgeton related remediation charges of $0.32 and divestiture related costs of $0.04. During the fourth quarter, we recorded the charge of $191 million primarily related to the Bridgeton Landfill. The charge for merrily relates to additional cost to operate by maintain and replace equipment through the end of the post closure period. We were able to make better assessment of future cosies -- excuse me, we were able to make a better assessment of future costs now that the lead chain management facilities operational and operating cost stabilized on equipment that was operated in prior quarters. The charges accrued up front because this is a closed site, but the cash will be spent over the next 35 years.
Fourth quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $84 million over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.6% and acquisitions of 1.3%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 1.7%, average yield in the collection business was 1.9%, which includes 2.9% yield in the industrial business, 2.1% yield in the commercial business and 90 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.6% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.8% primarily due to an increase industrial volume. Growth of the large container Industrial Business was 4.8% and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 6%. Volumes in the small container commercial business was up 1.2% and residential volume was relatively flat. The post-collection business was up 60 basis points and included landfill growth of 1.4%, partially offset by a decline in transfer station volumes of 1.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 2.1%, C&D increased 5.5% and special waste grew 50 basis points. We expect that special waste growth to moderate in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison in the prior year. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 20 basis points. Most of the change related to the decline in the cost of fuel. Fuel costs decreased approximately $22 million compared to the prior year, which includes the CNG tax credit of $10 million. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.58 in the fourth quarter from $3.87 in the prior year, a decrease of 7.5%. The current average diesel price is $2.83 per gallon. 
During 2014, we increased the amount of fuel we recovered through our fuel recovery fees program. Currently, we recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel cost. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At core participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel result in a $1 million change in operating income. Since diesel cost decreased significantly over the last 2 months, we expect to realize a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter of 2015. This relates to the timing of our fuel recovery fee adjustment, which tends to lag the change in fuel expense by 1 to 2 months. We assume diesel prices remain at the current price of $2.83 per gallon in our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance. We expect the favorable impact to EBITDA margins in 2015 since both revenue and cost will decline by a relatively equal amount. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales reflects a decrease in tons sold and a decline in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2.5% to an average price of $113 per ton in the fourth quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter recycling volume of 568,000 tons was down approximately 5% from the prior year. Most of the decrease relates to underperforming facilities we closed during the year. Cost to goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $4 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Current average commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. This is down approximately $20 per ton from October prices, which we use to provide our preliminary outlook. This results in a $0.06 headwind to 2015 EPS if prices remain at current levels. 
We are taking actions to raise prices for recycling collection services and adjusting rate rebates to our open market customers in response to lower commodity prices. We know our customers value the high-quality recycling services that we provide and we must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. 
Before I move on, I'd like to summarize the impact of changing fuel and commodity prices on our 2015 guidance and reconcile the difference to the preliminary outlook we provided last October. The impact of lower net fuel and lower recycling commodity prices results in a $0.04 EPS headwind consisting of a decrease of $0.06 due to lower commodity prices and an increase of $0.02 due to the timing difference of our fuel recovery fee program. Accordingly, the low end of our 2015 EPS guidance is $0.04 lower than our preliminary outlook. This assumes recycled commodity prices remain at current levels. The high-end of our 2015 EPS guidance is only $0.02 lower than our preliminary outlook. The high-end considers the impact if commodity prices return back to $115 per ton beginning in the second quarter. Excluding fuel and commodity, our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1% compared to 30.3% in the prior year, a decrease of 220 basis points. Most of the change relates to favorable items in the prior year, which included 160 basis points from onetime environmental and risk insurance savings. The remaining 60 basis point change primarily relates to an increase in legal accruals of 50 basis points and the timing of incentive compensation accruals of 50 basis points. And these are partially offset by a benefit from CNG tax credits of 40 basis points. On a full year basis, our EBITDA margin was 28.1%. 
I'd like to point out a couple of line items. Maintenance cost increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to increased vehicle complexity and costs to refurbished vehicles and continues to support volume growth. We continue to see higher costs to maintain newer engines due to enhanced emissions controls. SG&A costs were 10.3% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to an increase in incentive compensation expense and an adjustment to bad debt expense in the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selective balance sheet data. Brian?"

We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.98 to $2.04. This performance represents mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.06 headwind from tax-related items and $0.04 headwind from net fuel and commodity. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $710 million to $740 million. This performance represents mid- to high-single-digit growth after excluding the cash tax impact of the expiration of bonus depreciation and the impact from net fuel and commodity. We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes average yield of approximately 1.5%, volume growth of 1.5% to 2%, contribution from acquisitions of 1.5%, a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1% and a reduction in recycled commodity revenue of 50 to 100 basis points. We anticipate EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%. Our 2015 EBITDA margin guidance is consistent with our slightly up versus -- or slightly up versus our 2014 performance. Most of the expected improvement relates to the impact of lower net fuel. 
2015 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $855 million, this level of spending includes $40 million benefit from cost-effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, offset by growth capital of $35 million, infrastructure development of $15 million and investments in technology of $10 million. Our 2015 guidance does not include the pending acquisition of Turbina LLC, which we anticipate will close this month. We expect to maintain our 2015 full year EPS and free cash flow guidance after the deal closes since integration costs and infrastructure development expenditures are projected to offset the contribution from the acquisition in the first year. This is consistent with the expectation we provided when we announced the deal in December. 
The long-term business fundamentals and strength of our assets has not changed. We will continue to manage the business to create long-term shareholder value. In 2015, we will remain focused on executing our strategy, which is designed to profitably grow our business through organic growth opportunities and acquisitions; gain pricing power through differentiation and superior service delivery; improve productivity and reduced costs through our fleet-based initiatives; generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth and continually improve return on invested capital; and increase cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital structure. We look forward to delivering on our promises to key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience. For the communities we serve, we are the go to resource for delivering safe, environmentally friendly and innovative solutions that make communities better. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice. And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, improving return on invested capital and increasing cash returns.

So we think it's going to continue and remember, I mean, household formation is still not at the 50-year average. So we think, over time, it could get back to that. But I think we've got a pretty solid plan for '15 and that we'll see this sort of continued volume as we saw in '14 in C&D. And of course we've seen it in our landfills too, which, again, very broad-based. So I think I'm try to go forward we don't really talk our halls between residential and commercial.

So first of all, you know that our fuel were basically have a natural hedge built into our operating model with our fuel recovery fee and then our fuel hedges. So talks initial marks we're not going to see much benefit for dropping fuel prices. So that's that. As far as consumption goes, will the average consumer because they're spending less on fuel, spend by the economy? I think maybe over the long term, I think I saw some stands are said that people are putting back a little bit because we're not sure that this lower fuel environments going to last very long. But if it last on an embedded look second structural shift and maybe people were start putting some of their cash back to work in the economy that there's a pity be good for us in the small container in the landfill business. So we'll see what happens with that. As far as what it does competitively, certainly, the small companies that don't have fuel recovery fee that don't have this path of mechanism, they are experiencing today sort of an immediate improvement in their operating expenses. If they're really smart, they'll hang onto that and realize that this fuel environment may not stay low for a very long, and they want just get back in there pricing. That would be the smart way to look at it is the same time, our customers are experiencing price benefits from us because we have this fair mechanism that as fuel goes up, we share the risk. And as fuel goes down, we share the benefit. And so our customers are seeing some price relief in there on their bills, which I think position is pretty well with a customer as the contractor as part of being there. So we have not heard of any rational competitive behavior because of you will issues at this point. I don't know that I expect it. It's not keeping me up at night, though. I think overall with a dropping fuel prices, our customers probably feel pretty good and were doing a good job for them, and we'll continue to adjust their pricing as necessary with other inflation."

Dial back now 4 years ahead of that, where we are today, no one really believes that no one sees CPI normalizing to it's 25-year average above 3% and everyone sort of agrees on the fact that the CPI it's been manipulated. So we can't live in that environment. And so we are moving forward, as I said, with new indices. We're not going to do business or take new business that doesn't need our return criteria and we intend to improve this business over the long term. And we think we've got some good traction so far."

We know our service margins are improving. Missed pickups are down. Service commitments are up and our Net Promoter Score has improved dramatically since we introduced it.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continued to execute on our long-term strategy designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, while continually improving return on invested capital. 
Some of our financial highlights for the quarter and full year include: fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50. This result includes a $0.02 benefit from the extension of CNG fuel tax credits. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.96 and adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. Both performance metrics were in line with the full year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.2% and average yield was 1.7%. This is our highest level of average yield in the last 4 years. Fourth quarter volumes increased 1.6%. Volume growth continues to be concentrated to construction and demolition waste. We returned approximately $780 million total cash to shareholders during the year, which represents a cash yield of 6%. This includes 11 million shares repurchased for $400 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 24.7%, the highest level in the solid waste industry and well above the S&P 500 average. 
Throughout 2014, we discussed our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. I will now recap our progress made during the year.
14% of our fleet is operating on natural gas. During 2014, we added 7 CNG fueling stations and now operate a total of 36. We increased the automated portion of our residential fleet to 69% from 66% in the prior year. During 2014, we certified 14% of the fleet under our One Fleet Maintenance program, approximately 60% of our fleet has been certified since inception. Some of the benefits we are seeing in our One Fleet divisions include: 1% to 2% lower maintenance cost per engine hour; 2% greater fleet reliability; 20% fewer unscheduled repairs; and 50% lower technician turnover. We continue to make investments in recycling facilities to improve productivity and increase capabilities, while rationalizing underperforming assets. We closed 7 older recycling facilities that were not earning an adequate return during 2014. We invested $231 million to acquire $132 million of solid waste revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5.6x. This includes the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal, a high-quality franchise business that complements our Southern California operations. 
Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tervita, LLC for approximately $485 million. The acquisition of Tervita provides a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and unites an experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We believe the E&P waste sector provides attractive long-term growth opportunities and leverages our expertise in waste handling, recovery and disposal. The assets are well-positioned with approximately 80% of the revenue generated in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basins. We expect the deal to close this month. 
During 2014, we entered -- or we heightened our focus on our customers to differentiate our service offering, build customer loyalty and increase willingness to pay. For example, we launched the My Resource customer portal, which gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. Over 500,000 customers have enrolled to date. We launched the My Resource mobile app, an expansion of our customer's online management tool. The app allows customers to schedule services and receive push notifications using a mobile device. We implemented the tablet-based capture pricing tool, which creates a more professional sales experience and helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale. This rollout is complete in 17 of our 20 areas. And we launched priority-based selling or PBS, which enables us to identify and segment customers' buying priorities and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. We expect that PBS will be fully implemented by the end of 2015. 
I'm proud of our many achievements during 2014, which are reflected in our strong performance. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on the residential business. 
Last quarter, we discussed the actions we are taking to improve performance. Since then, we have engaged many of our municipal customers and made good progress. Most of our municipal partners want a pricing mechanism that is fair for both parties and understand low CPA-spaced resets have not kept pace with cost increases over the last 6 years. We have continued to educate municipalities and expanded the use of indexes published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that more closely align with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. We are very early in the process, but remain encouraged by our initial results. The remainder of our business continues to perform well and is generating strong year-over-year increases in revenue and EBITDA. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which excluded Bridgeton-related remediation charges of $0.32 and divestiture-related costs of $0.04. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a charge of $191 million primarily related to the Bridgeton Landfill. The charge primarily relates to additional cost to operate, maintain and replace equipment through the end of the post-closure period. We were able to make better assessment of future costs -- excuse me, we were able to make a better assessment of future costs now that the lead chain management facilities operational and operating cost stabilized on equipment that was operated in prior quarters. The charges accrued up front because this is a closed site, but the cash will be spent over the next 35 years.
Fourth quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $84 million over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.6% and acquisitions of 1.3%. The components of internal growth are: average yield growth of 1.7%; average yield in the collection business was 1.9%, which includes 2.9% yield in the industrial business; 2.1% yield in the commercial business; and 90 basis points in the residential business. 
Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.6% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.8%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the large container industrial business was 4.8% and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 6%. Volume in the small container commercial business was up 1.2% and residential volume was relatively flat. The post-collection business was up 60 basis points and included landfill growth of 1.4%, partially offset by a decline in transfer station volumes of 1.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 2.1%, C&D increased 5.5% and special waste grew 50 basis points. We expect that special waste growth to moderate in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison in the prior year. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 20 basis points. Most of the change related to the decline in the cost of fuel. Fuel costs decreased approximately $22 million compared to the prior year, which includes a CNG tax credit of $10 million. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.58 in the fourth quarter from $3.87 in the prior year, a decrease of 7.5%. The current average diesel price is $2.83 per gallon. 
During 2014, we increased the amount of fuel we recover through our fuel recovery fee program. Currently, we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20-per-gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. Since diesel cost decreased significantly over the last 2 months, we expect to realize a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter of 2015. This relates to the timing of our fuel recovery fee adjustment, which tends to lag the change in fuel expense by 1 to 2 months. 
We assume diesel prices remain at the current price of $2.83 per gallon in our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance. We expect a favorable impact to EBITDA margins in 2015 since both revenue and costs will decline by a relatively equal amount. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales reflects a decrease in tons sold and a decline in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2.5% to an average price of $113 per ton in the fourth quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter recycling volume of 568,000 tons was down approximately 5% from the prior year. Most of the decrease relates to underperforming facilities we closed during the year. 
Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $4 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Current average commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. This is down approximately $20 per ton from October prices, which we used to provide our preliminary outlook. This results in a $0.06 headwind to 2015 EPS if prices remain at current levels. 
We are taking actions to raise prices for recycling collection services and adjusting rate -- rebates to our open market customers in response to lower commodity prices. We know our customers value the high-quality recycling services that we provide, and we must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. 
Before I move on, I'd like to summarize the impact of changing fuel and commodity prices on our 2015 guidance, and reconcile the difference to the preliminary outlook we've provided last October. 
The impact of lower net fuel and lower recycling commodity prices results in a $0.04 EPS headwind consisting of a decrease of $0.06 due to lower commodity prices; and an increase of $0.02 due to the timing difference of our fuel recovery fee program. Accordingly, the low end of our 2015 EPS guidance is $0.04 lower than our preliminary outlook. This assumes recycled commodity prices remain at current levels. 
The high end of our 2015 EPS guidance is only $0.02 lower than our preliminary outlook. The high end considers the impact if commodity prices return back to $115 per ton beginning in the second quarter. 
Excluding fuel and commodity, our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, compared to 30.3% in the prior year, a decrease of 220 basis points. Most of the change relates to favorable items in the prior year, which included 160 basis points from onetime environmental and risk insurance savings. The remaining 60-basis-point change primarily relates to: an increase in legal accruals of 50 basis points; and the timing of incentive compensation accruals of 50 basis points. And these are partially offset by a benefit from CNG tax credits of 40 basis points. 
On a full year basis, our EBITDA margin was 28.1%. 
I'd like to point out a couple of line items. Maintenance cost increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to increased vehicle complexity and cost to refurbish vehicles and containers to support volume growth. We continue to see higher costs to maintain newer engines due to enhanced emissions controls. 
SG&A costs were 10.3% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to an increase in incentive compensation expense and an adjustment to bad debt expense in the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data. Brian?"

The increase in tax rate, together with the expiration of CNG tax credits, results in a $0.06 EPS headwind in 2015. 
Full year adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $45 million, partially offset by a capital pull forward of $25 million. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $930 million and days sales outstanding was 38 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue.

We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.98 to $2.04. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.06 headwind from tax-related items and $0.04 headwind from net fuel and commodity. 
We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $710 million to $740 million. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit growth after excluding the cash tax impact from the expiration of bonus depreciation and impact from net fuel and commodity. 
We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes average yield of approximately 1.5%; volume growth of 1.5% to 2%; contribution from acquisitions of 1.5%; a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1%; and a reduction in recycled commodity revenue of 50 to 100 basis points. 
We anticipate EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%. Our 2015 EBITDA margin guidance is consistent with our slightly up versus -- or slightly up versus our 2014 performance. Most of the expected improvement relates to the impact of lower net fuel. 
2015 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $855 million, this level of spending includes a $40 million benefit from cost-effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, offset by growth capital of $35 million; infrastructure development of $15 million; and investments in technology of $10 million. Our 2015 guidance does not include the pending acquisition of Tervita, LLC, which we anticipate will close this month. 
We expect to maintain our 2015 full year EPS and free cash flow guidance after the deal closes, since integration costs and infrastructure development expenditures are projected to offset the contribution from the acquisition in the first year. This is consistent with the expectation we provided when we announced the deal in December. 
The long-term business fundamentals and strength of our assets has not changed. We will continue to manage the business to create long-term shareholder value. In 2015, we will remain focused on executing our strategy, which is designed to profitably grow our business through organic growth opportunities and acquisitions; gain pricing power through differentiation and superior service delivery; improve productivity and reduced costs through our fleet-based initiatives; generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth and continually improve return on invested capital; and increase cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
We look forward to delivering on our promises to key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. 
For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience. 
For the communities we serve, we are the go-to resource for delivering safe, environmentally friendly and innovative solutions that make communities better. 
For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice. And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, improving return on invested capital and increasing cash returns.

We did start to see, at the end of 2014, a little bit of MSW volume activity pickup in our landfills. We haven't yet really seen much activity of real growth in our commercial business. We don't have much of that baked in really in '15, but that's maybe where the upside lies if we can start to see some of the broader economic recovery start to impact our commercial business. It's directionally good, but we haven't seen the uptick that we'd hope so far, but somewhere out there on the horizon for us."

So first of all, right, you know that our fuel will basically have a natural hedge built into our operating model with our fuel recovery fee and then our fuel hedges. So as Chuck spoke to in his remarks, we're not going to see much of a benefit for dropping fuel prices. So that's that. As far as consumption goes, will the average consumer, because they're spending less on fuel, spend more in the economy? I think maybe over the long term, I think I saw some stats here today that said that people are pulling back a little bit because they're not sure that this low-fuel environment is going to last very long. But if it lasts long enough, and it looks like a structural shift, then maybe people will start putting some of their cash back to work in the economy. That would certainly be good for us in the small container in the landfill business. So we'll see what happens with that. As far as what it does competitively, certainly, the small companies that don't have fuel recovery fee that don't have this path through mechanism, they are experiencing today sort of an immediate improvement in their operating expenses. If they're really smart, they'll hang onto that and realize that this fuel environment may not stay low for a very long, and they won't just get back in their pricing. That would be the smart way to look at it, if at the same time, our customers are experiencing price benefit from us because we have this fair birth mechanism that as fuel goes up, we share the risk. And as fuel goes down, we share the benefit. And so our customers are seeing some pricing relief on their bills, which I think position us pretty well with a customer as the contractor, so part of it is being fair. So we have not heard of any rational competitive behavior because of you will issues. At this point, I don't know that I expect it. It's not keeping me up at night, though. I think, overall, with dropping fuel prices, our customers probably feel pretty good, and we're doing a good job for them, and we'll continue to adjust their pricing as necessary with our other inflation."

that we need to give, and customers may leave for that reason. Fewer and fewer of those, let's say. But as we're replacing those customers that we lose, and remember we've got about a 7% defection rate in our business every year, 7% of customers leave us for some reason. We replace those customers. Well, the capture tool is designed really at the heart of that. So as our sales reps are out in the marketplace calling on new accounts, these may be new from competition, they may be new, new -- brand-new businesses springing out of the ground. We want to make sure that at the point of sale for those new accounts that we've got better controls in place to get the very best pricing in that situation. So capture allows our salespeople: one, to be more efficient, they cover more ground, they can see more customers; two, when they get in front of the customer, they can do a better job of understanding and segmenting that customer, understanding their needs, get ties right into the PBS selling initiative, we call it priority-based selling. So between the PBS training and the capture tool, we think our salespeople now are better equipped to go in and get better pricing on those new customers by doing a better job of understanding what's important to them and what they're willing to pay for. It also, again, makes them more efficient and make the sale -- it makes, actually, the experience better for customers because it's a tablet-based tool, we can show the customers their sample invoice. We can get a customer signature on the tablet for their electronic service agreement, the whole process just gets tighter and better. And we've got better control. So it's a cloud-based software, so if we want to raise prices in Denver tomorrow, tonight, we can make price adjustments to the actual price sheets that the salespeople use. And tomorrow, they can be selling at higher prices with very stringent guardrails and limits on their authority on what decisions they can make in front of the customer. So that was a mouthful, but does that help you, Tyler?"

The economy is -- has been battling back. You see all those metrics in the economy. We've been good public/private partners these municipalities. We did the right thing by trying to help them right-size their cost in sort of the time of trouble. We're frankly not willing to go any lower because we can't, and it's time for us now to expect a more fair and reasonable pricing mechanism in our contracts, going forward. The other thing to remember is, 4 years ago, when we were first living for the first couple of years in the slow CPI environment, nobody thought -- nobody I talked to thought CPI was going to stay low. Dial back now 4 years ahead of that, where we are today, and no one really believes that no one sees CPI normalizing to its 25-year average, above 3%. And everyone sort of agrees on the fact that the CPI has been -- is being manipulated. So we can't live in that environment. And so we are moving forward, as I said, with the new indices. We're not going to do business or take new business that doesn't need our return criteria. And we intend to improve this business over the long term. And maybe we got some good traction so far."

The tools we talked about, the PBS and the capture, really are focused at bringing on new business correctly. We think about defection, the 7% of business that we lose, the way we're focusing on that, Alex, is really through all of our customer service metrics. So we track across the entire company at every division. We track missed pickups. We track service commitments. We have got a number of service commitments that each of our general managers makes to customers in each of our divisions. We know what their adherence is to those commitments. We also use something called Net Promoter Score, which you talked about in the past. And we get direct feedback from our customers in every one of our markets on how they feel about our service and whether or not they would recommend us to somebody else. So we focus on those customer metrics to understand how we're doing in servicing our customers and how they value us. And basically, we're trying to drive all of those metrics up because we want to extend customer loyalty, right? We want customers to come with us, we want them to stay with us because we're a great service provider and that we meet their needs and we handle all of that for them, right? That's our tagline: ""We'll handle it from here."" So we're working on that. Can we get defection down from 7%, well, it used to be 10%. We brought it down to 7%, and we'll see where we go from here. We do know this, we know our service metrics are improving, missed pickups are down, service commitments are up and our Net Promoter Score has improved dramatically since we introduced it. So we also brought customer service metrics into our compensation programs for our general managers. So everyone has got some skin in the game now to improve the customer experience for each and every one of our customers. So that's how we're looking to get that done."

We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continued to execute on our long-term strategy designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, while continually improving return on invested capital. 
Some of our financial highlights for the quarter and full year include: fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50. This result includes a $0.02 benefit from the extension of CNG fuel tax credits. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.96 and adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. Both performance metrics were in line with the full year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.2% and average yield was 1.7%. This is our highest level of average yield in the last 4 years. Fourth quarter volumes increased 1.6%. Volume growth continues to be concentrated to construction and demolition waste. We returned approximately $780 million total cash to shareholders during the year, which represents a cash yield of 6%. This includes 11 million shares repurchased for $400 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 24.7%, the highest level in the solid waste industry and well above the S&P 500 average. 
Throughout 2014, we discussed our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. I will now recap our progress made during the year.
14% of our fleet is operating on natural gas. During 2014, we added 7 CNG fueling stations and now operate a total of 36. We increased the automated portion of our residential fleet to 69% from 66% in the prior year. During 2014, we certified 14% of the fleet under our One Fleet Maintenance program, approximately 60% of our fleet has been certified since inception. Some of the benefits we are seeing in our One Fleet divisions include: 1% to 2% lower maintenance cost per engine hour; 2% greater fleet reliability; 20% fewer unscheduled repairs; and 50% lower technician turnover. We continue to make investments in recycling facilities to improve productivity and increase capabilities, while rationalizing underperforming assets. We closed 7 older recycling facilities that were not earning an adequate return during 2014. We invested $231 million to acquire $132 million of solid waste revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5.6x. This includes the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal, a high-quality franchise business that complements our Southern California operations. 
Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tervita, LLC for approximately $485 million. The acquisition of Tervita provides a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and unites an experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We believe the E&P waste sector provides attractive long-term growth opportunities and leverages our expertise in waste handling, recovery and disposal. The assets are well-positioned with approximately 80% of the revenue generated in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basins. We expect the deal to close this month. 
During 2014, we entered -- or we heightened our focus on our customers to differentiate our service offering, build customer loyalty and increase willingness to pay. For example, we launched the My Resource customer portal, which gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. Over 500,000 customers have enrolled to date. We launched the My Resource mobile app, an expansion of our customer's online management tool. The app allows customers to schedule services and receive push notifications using a mobile device. We implemented the tablet-based capture pricing tool, which creates a more professional sales experience and helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale. This rollout is complete in 17 of our 20 areas. And we launched priority-based selling or PBS, which enables us to identify and segment customers' buying priorities and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. We expect that PBS will be fully implemented by the end of 2015. 
I'm proud of our many achievements during 2014, which are reflected in our strong performance. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on the residential business. 
Last quarter, we discussed the actions we are taking to improve performance. Since then, we have engaged many of our municipal customers and made good progress. Most of our municipal partners want a pricing mechanism that is fair for both parties and understand low CPA-spaced resets have not kept pace with cost increases over the last 6 years. We have continued to educate municipalities and expanded the use of indexes published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that more closely align with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. We are very early in the process, but remain encouraged by our initial results. The remainder of our business continues to perform well and is generating strong year-over-year increases in revenue and EBITDA. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

The charge primarily relates to additional cost to operate, maintain and replace equipment through the end of the post-closure period. We were able to make better assessment of future costs -- excuse me, we were able to make a better assessment of future costs now that the lead chain management facilities is operational and operating costs stabilized on equipment that was operated in prior quarters. The charges accrued up front because this is a closed site, but the cash will be spent over the next 35 years.
Fourth quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $84 million over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.6% and acquisitions of 1.3%. The components of internal growth are: average yield growth of 1.7%; average yield in the collection business was 1.9%, which includes 2.9% yield in the industrial business; 2.1% yield in the commercial business; and 90 basis points in the residential business. 
Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.6% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.8%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the large container industrial business was 4.8% and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 6%. Volume in the small container commercial business was up 1.2% and residential volume was relatively flat. The post-collection business was up 60 basis points and included landfill growth of 1.4%, partially offset by a decline in transfer station volumes of 1.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 2.1%, C&D increased 5.5% and special waste grew 50 basis points. We expect that special waste growth to moderate in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison in the prior year. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 20 basis points. Most of the change related to the decline in the cost of fuel. Fuel costs decreased approximately $22 million compared to the prior year, which includes a CNG tax credit of $10 million. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.58 in the fourth quarter from $3.87 in the prior year, a decrease of 7.5%. The current average diesel price is $2.83 per gallon. 
During 2014, we increased the amount of fuel we recovered through our fuel recovery fee program. Currently, we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20-per-gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. Since diesel cost decreased significantly over the last 2 months, we expect to realize a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter of 2015. This relates to the timing of our fuel recovery fee adjustment, which tends to lag the change in fuel expense by 1 to 2 months. 
We assume diesel prices remain at the current price of $2.83 per gallon in our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance. We expect a favorable impact to EBITDA margins in 2015 since both revenue and costs will decline by a relatively equal amount. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales reflects a decrease in tons sold and a decline in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2.5% to an average price of $113 per ton in the fourth quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter recycling volume of 568,000 tons was down approximately 5% from the prior year. Most of the decrease relates to underperforming facilities we closed during the year. 
Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $4 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Current average commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. This is down approximately $20 per ton from October prices, which we used to provide our preliminary outlook. This results in a $0.06 headwind to 2015 EPS if prices remain at current levels. 
We are taking actions to raise prices for recycling collection services and adjusting rate -- rebates to our open market customers in response to lower commodity prices. We know our customers value the high-quality recycling services that we provide, and we must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. 
Before I move on, I'd like to summarize the impact of changing fuel and commodity prices on our 2015 guidance, and reconcile the difference to the preliminary outlook we've provided last October. 
The impact of lower net fuel and lower recycling commodity prices results in a $0.04 EPS headwind consisting of a decrease of $0.06 due to lower commodity prices; and an increase of $0.02 due to the timing difference of our fuel recovery fee program. Accordingly, the low end of our 2015 EPS guidance is $0.04 lower than our preliminary outlook. This assumes recycled commodity prices remain at current levels. 
The high end of our 2015 EPS guidance is only $0.02 lower than our preliminary outlook. The high end considers the impact if commodity prices return back to $115 per ton beginning in the second quarter. 
Excluding fuel and commodity, our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, compared to 30.3% in the prior year, a decrease of 220 basis points. Most of the change relates to favorable items in the prior year, which included 160 basis points from onetime environmental and risk insurance savings. The remaining 60-basis-point change primarily relates to: an increase in legal accruals of 50 basis points; and the timing of incentive compensation accruals of 50 basis points. And these are partially offset by a benefit from CNG tax credits of 40 basis points. 
On a full year basis, our EBITDA margin was 28.1%. 
I'd like to point out a couple of line items. Maintenance cost increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to increased vehicle complexity and cost to refurbish vehicles and containers to support volume growth. We continue to see higher costs to maintain newer engines due to enhanced emissions controls. 
SG&A costs were 10.3% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to an increase in incentive compensation expense and an adjustment to bad debt expense in the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data. Brian?"

We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.98 to $2.04. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.06 headwind from tax-related items and $0.04 headwind from net fuel and commodity. 
We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $710 million to $740 million. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit growth after excluding the cash tax impact from the expiration of bonus depreciation and impact from net fuel and commodity. 
We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes average yield of approximately 1.5%; volume growth of 1.5% to 2%; contribution from acquisitions of 1.5%; a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1%; and a reduction in recycled commodity revenue of 50 to 100 basis points. 
We anticipate EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%. Our 2015 EBITDA margin guidance is consistent with our slightly up versus -- or slightly up versus our 2014 performance. Most of the expected improvement relates to the impact of lower net fuel. 
2015 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $855 million, this level of spending includes a $40 million benefit from cost-effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, offset by growth capital of $35 million; infrastructure development of $15 million; and investments in technology of $10 million. Our 2015 guidance does not include the pending acquisition of Tervita, LLC, which we anticipate will close this month. 
We expect to maintain our 2015 full year EPS and free cash flow guidance after the deal closes, since integration costs and infrastructure development expenditures are projected to offset the contribution from the acquisition in the first year. This is consistent with the expectation we provided when we announced the deal in December. 
The long-term business fundamentals and strength of our assets has not changed. We will continue to manage the business to create long-term shareholder value. In 2015, we will remain focused on executing our strategy, which is designed to profitably grow our business through organic growth opportunities and acquisitions; gain pricing power through differentiation and superior service delivery; improve productivity and reduced costs through our fleet-based initiatives; generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth and continually improve return on invested capital; and increase cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
We look forward to delivering on our promises to key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. 
For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience. 
For the communities we serve, we are the go-to resource for delivering safe, environmentally friendly and innovative solutions that make communities better. 
For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice. And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, improving return on invested capital and increasing cash returns.

So first of all, right, you know that our fuel will basically have a natural hedge built into our operating model with our fuel recovery fee and then our fuel hedges. So as Chuck spoke to in his remarks, we're not going to see much of a benefit for dropping fuel prices. So that's that. As far as consumption goes, will the average consumer, because they're spending less on fuel, spend more in the economy? I think maybe over the long term, I think I saw some stats here today that said that people are pulling back a little bit because they're not sure that this low-fuel environment is going to last very long. But if it lasts long enough, and it looks like a structural shift, then maybe people will start putting some of their cash back to work in the economy. That would certainly be good for us in the small container and the landfill business. So we'll see what happens with that. As far as what it does competitively, certainly, the small companies that don't have fuel recovery fee that don't have this paSmart Safe through mechanism, they are experiencing today sort of an immediate improvement in their operating expenses. If they're really smart, they'll hang onto that and realize that this fuel environment may not stay low for a very long, and they won't just get back in their pricing. That would be the smart way to look at it, if at the same time, our customers are experiencing price benefit from us because we have this fair birth mechanism that as fuel goes up, we share the risk. And as fuel goes down, we share the benefit. And so our customers are seeing some pricing relief on their bills, which I think position us pretty well with a customer as the contractor, so part of it is being fair. So we have not heard of any irrational competitive behavior because of you will issues. At this point, I don't know that I expect it. It's not keeping me up at night, though. I think, overall, with dropping fuel prices, our customers probably feel pretty good, and we're doing a good job for them, and we'll continue to adjust their pricing as necessary with our other inflation."

that we need to give, and customers may leave for that reason. Fewer and fewer of those, let's say. But as we're replacing those customers that we lose, and remember we've got about a 7% defection rate in our business every year, 7% of customers leave us for some reason. We replace those customers. Well, the capture tool is designed really at the heart of that. So as our sales reps are out in the marketplace calling on new accounts, these may be new from competition, they may be new, new -- brand-new businesses springing out of the ground. We want to make sure that at the point of sale for those new accounts that we've got better controls in place to get the very best pricing in that situation. So capture allows our salespeople: one, to be more efficient, they cover more ground, they can see more customers; two, when they get in front of the customer, they can do a better job of understanding and segmenting that customer, understanding their needs, it ties right into the PBS selling initiative, we call it priority-based selling. So between the PBS training and the capture tool, we think our salespeople now are better equipped to go in and get better pricing on those new customers by doing a better job of understanding what's important to them and what they're willing to pay for. It also, again, makes them more efficient and make the sale -- it makes, actually, the experience better for customers because it's a tablet-based tool, we can show the customers their sample invoice. We can get a customer signature on the tablet for their electronic service agreement, the whole process just gets tighter and better. And we've got better control. So it's a cloud-based software, so if we want to raise prices in Denver tomorrow; tonight, we can make price adjustments to the actual price sheets that the salespeople use. And tomorrow, they can be selling at higher prices with very stringent guardrails and limits on their authority on what decisions they can make in front of the customer. So that was a mouthful, but does that help you, Tyler?"

The economy is -- has been battling back. You see all those metrics in the economy. We've been good public/private partners these municipalities. We did the right thing by trying to help them right-size their costs in sort of the time of trouble. We're frankly not willing to go any lower because we can't, and it's time for us now to expect a more fair and reasonable pricing mechanism in our contracts, going forward. The other thing to remember is, 4 years ago, when we were first living for the first couple of years in this low CPI environment, nobody thought -- nobody I talked to thought CPI was going to stay low. Dial back now 4 years ahead of that, where we are today, and no one really believes that no one sees CPI normalizing to its 25-year average, above 3%. And everyone sort of agrees on the fact that the CPI has been -- is being manipulated. So we can't live in that environment. And so we are moving forward, as I said, with the new indices.

So we track across the entire company at every division. We track missed pickups. We track service commitments. We have got a number of service commitments that each of our general managers makes to customers in each of our divisions. We know what their adherence is to those commitments. We also use something called Net Promoter Score, which we've talked about in the past. And we get direct feedback from our customers in every one of our markets on how they feel about our service and whether or not they would recommend us to somebody else. So we focus on those customer metrics to understand how we're doing in servicing our customers and how they value us. And basically, we're trying to drive all of those metrics up because we want to extend customer loyalty, right? We want customers to come with us, we want them to stay with us because we're a great service provider and that we meet their needs and we handle all of that for them, right? That's our tagline: ""We'll handle it from here."" So we're working on that. Can we get defection down from 7%, well, it used to be 10%. We brought it down to 7%, and we'll see where we go from here. We do know this, we know our service metrics are improving, missed pickups are down, service commitments are up and our Net Promoter Score has improved dramatically since we introduced it.

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continued to execute on our long-term strategy, which is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, expand margins and continually improve return on invested capital. Some of our financial highlights for the quarter include: first quarter EPS was $0.49, which included a $0.02 benefit from the timing of our fuel recovery fee. We anticipated this benefit as part of our full year guidance provided in February. Adjusted free cash flow was $241 million, which was in line with our expectations. EBITDA margin was 28.9% and represents a 120 basis-point improvement from the prior year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the net impact of fuel and recycled commodities. Core price in the first quarter was 3.7% and average yield was 2.1%. This is our highest level of average yield in over 4 years. .
First quarter volumes increased 1.9% with positive contribution from all of our collection and disposal lines of business. We returned $194 million total cash to our shareholders during the quarter. This includes 2.3 million shares repurchased for $95 million. We have $265 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. 
We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. By the end of the first quarter, 15% of our fleet was operating on natural gas, 69% of our residential fleet was automated and 64% of our fleet was certified under our One Fleet Maintenance program. Additionally, all of our markets are now using our capture pricing tool. We have trained and implemented our priority-based selling program or PBS in approximately 60% of our markets. We expect PBS to be fully implemented by the end of the year. And finally, over 700,000 customers are enrolled in our customer portal called My Resource. On February 13th, we closed the acquisition of Tervita LOC. The assets provide a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and unite our experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We're still early in the integration process, but it's going well and is expected. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice, we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July. 
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on our municipal business. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that are more closely aligned with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. During the quarter, we converted an additional $40 million of annual revenue and now have over 300 contracts, representing $110 million of annual revenue using an alternative index. We are still early in the process but very encouraged by our initial success. We continue to offer high-quality services and products to our municipal customers, but must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. Converting to alternative indices, together with our actions we are taking to improve the performance of our municipal business, will take several years to realize the full impact, given the long-term nature of these contracts. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

This 4.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 2.1%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 2.1%, average yield in the collection business was 2.5%, which includes 4.1% yield in the industrial business, 3.2% yield in the commercial business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.7%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Our volumes increased 1.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.7%, primarily due to an increase in large container industrial volume. Growth in the Industrial Business was 3.9% with relatively equal contribution from the business and temporary C&D hauls. Volumes in the small container commercial business was up 0.8% and residential volume was positive 1.1%. The post collection business was up 3.9%, which is comprised of landfill growth of 4.2%, and transfer volume growth of 3.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 5%, C&D increased 10% and special waste grew 3%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 70 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $15 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.92 in the first quarter from $3.96 in the the prior year. A decrease of 26%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. Currently, we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost to our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallon per hedge using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. We realized a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter due to a timing difference between our fuel recovery fee revenue adjustment and fuel expense, which tends to lag by 1 to 2 months. We do not expect this benefit to continue in future quarters. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices -- recycling facilities decreased 17% to an average price of $97 per ton in the first quarter from $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton. First quarter recycling volume of 580,000 tons represents growth of approximately 4% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, the volumes were down 5% and below our expectations. This was primarily due to congestion at the West Coast ports. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.9% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, an increase of 120 basis points. Most of the improvements relates to the changes in net fuel and commodity, which added 90 basis points. The remaining 30 basis point change primarily relates to reduction in risk insurance expense as a result of favorable claims development and continued improvement in safety-related performance. SG&A costs were 11% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This change includes acquisition-related costs and integration expenses associated with recent acquisitions, which included approximately 30 basis points of expense during the quarter. 
I want to remind you that we provide detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data."

We also have had increasingly better pricing on a consecutive basis over the last 4 or 5 quarters. And so as we go through the year, the comps, the pricing are going to get a little more difficult because we have been improving average yield consistently. So that's going to be coming up on us. And then lastly, we've got a lot of pricing actions out there, in Q1 specifically, in and around recycling. As you know, we were hit the hardware commodity sale prices, and we've taken some pretty serious actions for pricing the field, specifically in and around recycling customers. And that's all shown up in that yield."

And you see that they're the numbers. So we've got that as a headwind remaining on the year, and we don't know what's going to happen here just yet. So we sought to overcome 3 more quarters of a pretty tough recycling commodity market. We are getting traction in the programs. Remember, last Q1 was pretty weak with the adverse weather.

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continue to execute on our long-term strategy, which is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, expand margins and continually improve return on invested capital. Some of our financial highlights for the quarter include: first quarter EPS was $0.49, which included a $0.02 benefit from the timing of our fuel recovery fee. We anticipated this benefit as part of our full year guidance provided in February. Adjusted free cash flow was $241 million, which was in line with our expectations. EBITDA margin was 28.9% and represents a 120 basis-point improvement from the prior year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the net impact of fuel and recycled commodities. Core price in the first quarter was 3.7% and average yield was 2.1%. This is our highest level of average yield in over 4 years.
First quarter volumes increased 1.9% with positive contribution from all of our collection and disposal lines of business. We returned $194 million total cash to our shareholders during the quarter. This includes 2.3 million shares repurchased for $95 million. We have $265 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. 
We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. By the end of the first quarter, 15% of our fleet was operating on natural gas, 69% of our residential fleet was automated and 64% of our fleet was certified under our One Fleet Maintenance program. Additionally, all of our markets are now using our capture pricing tool. We have trained and implemented our priority-based selling program or PBS in approximately 60% of our markets. We expect PBS to be fully implemented by the end of the year. And finally, over 700,000 customers are enrolled in our customer portal called My Resource. On February 13th, we closed the acquisition of Tervita, LLC. The assets provide a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and unite an experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We are still early in the integration process, but it's going well and is expected. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice, we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July. 
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on our municipal business. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that more closely align with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. During the quarter, we converted an additional $40 million of annual revenue and now have over 300 contracts, representing $110 million of annual revenue using an alternative index. We are still early in the process but very encouraged by our initial success. We continue to offer high-quality services and products to our municipal customers, but must earn in appropriate return to deliver those services. Converting to alternative indices, together with our actions we are taking to improve the performance of our municipal business will take several years to realize the full impact, given the long-term nature of these contracts. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

This 4.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 2.1%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 2.1%, average yield in the collection business was 2.5%, which includes 4.1% yield in the industrial business, 3.2% yield in the commercial business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.7%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Our volumes increased 1.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.7%, primarily due to an increase in large container industrial volume. Growth in the industrial business was 3.9% with relatively equal contribution from the permanent business and temporary C&D hauls. Volumes in the small container commercial business was up 0.8% and residential volume was positive 1.1%. The post-collection business was up 3.9%, which is comprised of landfill growth of 4.2%, and transfer volume growth of 3.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 5%, C&D increased 10% and special waste grew 3%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 70 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $15 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.92 in the first quarter from $3.96 in the prior year. A decrease of 26%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. Currently, we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallon are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. We realized a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter due to a timing difference between our fuel recovery fee, revenue adjustment and fuel expense, which tends to lag by 1 to 2 months. We do not expect this benefit to continue in future quarters. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 17% to an average price of $97 per ton in the first quarter from $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton. First quarter recycling volume of 580,000 tons represents growth of approximately 4% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were down 5% and below our expectations. This was primarily due to congestion at the West Coast ports. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
Now, I will discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.9% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, an increase of 120 basis points. Most of the improvements relates to changes in net fuel and commodity, which added 90 basis points. The remaining 30 basis point change primarily relates to reduction in risk insurance expense as a result of favorable claims development and continued improvement in safety-related performance. SG&A costs were 11% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This change includes acquisition-related costs and integration expenses associated with recent acquisitions, which included approximately 30 basis points of expense during the quarter. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data."

And then lastly, we've got a lot of pricing actions out there, in Q1 specifically, in and around recycling. As you know, we were hit pretty hard with the commodity sale prices, and we've taken some pretty serious actions for pricing in the field, specifically in and around recycling customers. And that's all shown up in that yield."

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Republic teams continue to execute on our long-term strategy, which is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, expand margins and continually improve return on invested capital. Some of our financial highlights for the quarter include: first quarter EPS was $0.49, which included a $0.02 benefit from the timing of our fuel recovery fee. We anticipated this benefit as part of our full year guidance provided in February. Adjusted free cash flow was $241 million, which was in line with our expectations. EBITDA margin was 28.9% and represents a 120 basis-point improvement from the prior year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the net impact of fuel and recycled commodities. Core price in the first quarter was 3.7% and average yield was 2.1%. This is our highest level of average yield in over 4 years.
First quarter volumes increased 1.9% with positive contribution from all of our collection and disposal lines of business. We returned $194 million total cash to our shareholders during the quarter. This includes 2.3 million shares repurchased for $95 million. We have $265 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. 
We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. By the end of the first quarter, 15% of our fleet was operating on natural gas, 69% of our residential fleet was automated and 64% of our fleet was certified under our One Fleet Maintenance program. Additionally, all of our markets are now using our capture pricing tool. We have trained and implemented our priority-based selling program or PBS in approximately 60% of our markets. We expect PBS to be fully implemented by the end of the year. And finally, over 700,000 customers are enrolled in our customer portal called My Resource. On February 13th, we closed the acquisition of Tervita, LLC. The assets provide a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and unite an experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We are still early in the integration process, but it's going well and as expected. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice, we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July. 
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on our municipal business. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that more closely align with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. During the quarter, we converted an additional $40 million of annual revenue and now have over 300 contracts, representing $110 million of annual revenue using an alternative index. We are still early in the process but very encouraged by our initial success. We continue to offer high-quality services and products to our municipal customers, but must earn in appropriate return to deliver those services. Converting to alternative indices, together with our actions we are taking to improve the performance of our municipal business will take several years to realize the full impact, given the long-term nature of these contracts. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

This 4.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 2.1%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 2.1%, average yield in the collection business was 2.5%, which includes 4.1% yield in the industrial business, 3.2% yield in the commercial business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.7%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Our volumes increased 1.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.7%, primarily due to an increase in large container industrial volume. Growth in the industrial business was 3.9% with relatively equal contribution from the permanent business and temporary C&D hauls. Volumes in the small container commercial business was up 0.8% and residential volume was positive 1.1%. The post-collection business was up 3.9%, which is comprised of landfill growth of 4.2%, and transfer volume growth of 3.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 5%, C&D increased 10% and special waste grew 3%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 70 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $15 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.92 in the first quarter from $3.96 in the prior year. A decrease of 26%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. Currently, we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. We realized a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter due to a timing difference between our fuel recovery fee, revenue adjustment and fuel expense, which tends to lag by 1 to 2 months. We do not expect this benefit to continue in future quarters. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 17% to an average price of $97 per ton in the first quarter from $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton. First quarter recycling volume of 580,000 tons represents growth of approximately 4% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were down 5% and below our expectations. This was primarily due to congestion at the West Coast ports. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
Now, I will discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.9% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, an increase of 120 basis points. Most of the improvements relate to changes in net fuel and commodity, which added 90 basis points. The remaining 30 basis point change primarily relates to reduction in risk insurance expense as a result of favorable claims development and continued improvement in safety-related performance. SG&A costs were 11% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This change includes acquisition-related costs and integration expenses associated with recent acquisitions, which included approximately 30 basis points of expense during the quarter. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data."

As we said in the prepared remarks, we think that average yields should still be somewhere around the 1.5 guidance we gave. There's a couple of things happening in Q1. First of all, we've got a little softer quarter last year to compare it to. So that kind of flows through our results, you got to keep that in mind. Q1 of last year was impacted negatively by weather and other things. We also have had increasingly better pricing on a consecutive basis over the last 4 or 5 quarters. And so as we get through the year, the comps, the pricing are going to get a little more difficult because we have been improving average yield consistently. So that's going to be coming up on us. And then lastly, we've got a lot of pricing actions out there, in Q1 specifically, in and around recycling. As you know, we were hit pretty hard with the commodity sale prices, and we've taken some pretty serious actions for pricing in the field, specifically in and around recycling customers. And that's all showing up in that yield."

So reducing net churn from loss business and better negotiating skills with customers on potential reduction of rates when that's necessary, that's improving. So we're seeing it impact the churn, which we expected. We're seeing higher rates on new business as expected. And we don't have -- we've got it rolled out everywhere, as you would imagine, the divisions that had it rolled out earliest have got better compliance and adoption rates. And as the ones that have been through more recently, we still need to work on that, but we're continuing to improve that.

And you see that there in the numbers. So we've got that as a headwind remaining on the year, and we don't know what's going to happen there just yet. So we still have to overcome 3 more quarters of a pretty tough recycling commodity market. We are getting traction in the programs. Remember, last Q1 was pretty weak with the adverse weather. So this quarter is a fairly easy comp. Again, we got the $0.02 from fuel. That's going to go away. So we had a good quarter, we have solid quarter and we'll take all the credit for that. But it's just too early to talk about the year-end at this point. And again, as we get through the year, remember, we've been growing and improving price every quarter sequentially for the past 4, 5 quarters.

We are pleased with our strong first quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Republic teams continue to execute on our long-term strategy, which is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, expand margins and continually improve return on invested capital. Some of our financial highlights for the quarter include: first quarter EPS was $0.49, which included a $0.02 benefit from the timing of our fuel recovery fee. We anticipated this benefit as part of our full year guidance provided in February. Adjusted free cash flow was $241 million, which was in line with our expectations. EBITDA margin was 28.9% and represents a 120 basis-point improvement from the prior year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the net impact of fuel and recycled commodities. Core price in the first quarter was 3.7% and average yield was 2.1%. This is our highest level of average yield in over 4 years.
First quarter volumes increased 1.9% with positive contribution from all of our collection and disposal lines of business. We returned $194 million total cash to our shareholders during the quarter. This includes 2.3 million shares repurchased for $95 million. We have $265 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. 
We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. By the end of the first quarter, 15% of our fleet was operating on natural gas, 69% of our residential fleet was automated and 64% of our fleet was certified under our One Fleet Maintenance program. Additionally, all of our markets are now using our capture pricing tool. We have trained and implemented our priority-based selling program or PBS in approximately 60% of our markets. We expect PBS to be fully implemented by the end of the year. And finally, over 700,000 customers are enrolled in our customer portal called My Resource. On February 13th, we closed the acquisition of Tervita, LLC. The assets provide a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and unite an experienced high-quality workforce with the Republic team. We are still early in the integration process, but it's going well and as expected. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice, we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July. 
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on our municipal business. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that more closely align with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index and the garbage and trash collection index. During the quarter, we converted an additional $40 million of annual revenue and now have over 300 contracts, representing $110 million of annual revenue using an alternative index. We are still early in the process but very encouraged by our initial success. We continue to offer high-quality services and products to our municipal customers, but must earn in appropriate return to deliver those services. Converting to alternative indices, together with our actions we are taking to improve the performance of our municipal business will take several years to realize the full impact, given the long-term nature of these contracts. 
Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

This 4.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 2.1%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 2.1%, average yield in the collection business was 2.5%, which includes 4.1% yield in the industrial business, 3.2% yield in the commercial business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks to our same-store customer base, was 3.7%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Our volumes increased 1.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.7%, primarily due to an increase in large container industrial volume. Growth in the industrial business was 3.9% with relatively equal contribution from the permanent business and temporary C&D hauls. Volumes in the small container commercial business was up 0.8% and residential volume was positive 1.1%. The post-collection business was up 3.9%, which is comprised of landfill growth of 4.2%, and transfer volume growth of 3.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 5%, C&D increased 10% and special waste grew 3%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 70 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $15 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.92 in the first quarter from $3.96 in the prior year. A decrease of 26%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. Currently, we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. We realized a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter due to a timing difference between our fuel recovery fee, revenue adjustment and fuel expense, which tends to lag by 1 to 2 months. We do not expect this benefit to continue in future quarters. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 17% to an average price of $97 per ton in the first quarter from $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton. First quarter recycling volume of 580,000 tons represents growth of approximately 4% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were down 5% and below our expectations. This was primarily due to congestion at the West Coast ports. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
Now, I will discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.9% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, an increase of 120 basis points. Most of the improvements relate to changes in net fuel and commodity, which added 90 basis points. The remaining 30 basis point change primarily relates to reduction in risk insurance expense as a result of favorable claims development and continued improvement in safety-related performance. SG&A costs were 11% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This change includes acquisition-related costs and integration expenses associated with recent acquisitions, which included approximately 30 basis points of expense during the quarter. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data."

First of all, we've got a little softer quarter last year to compare it to. So that kind of flows through our results, you got to keep that in mind. Q1 of last year was impacted negatively by weather and other things. We also have had increasingly better pricing on a consecutive basis over the last 4 or 5 quarters. And so as we get through the year, the comps, the pricing are going to get a little more difficult because we have been improving average yield consistently. So that's going to be coming up on us. And then lastly, we've got a lot of pricing actions out there, in Q1 specifically, in and around recycling. As you know, we were hit pretty hard with the commodity sale prices, and we've taken some pretty serious actions for pricing in the field, specifically in and around recycling customers.

We anticipated some of that softness in our pro forma, and in our budget, our guidance and the place we're probably being -- seeing the weakest part in that business is the solids control piece of the business. It's coming little softer than expected and that's really got much more of a lower-margin associated with it.

So reducing net churn from loss business and better negotiating skills with customers on potential reduction of rates when that's necessary, that's improving. So we're seeing it impact the churn, which we expected. We're seeing higher rates on new business as expected. And we don't have -- we've got it rolled out everywhere, as you would imagine, the divisions that had it rolled out earliest have got better compliance and adoption rates.

The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of core price and average yield, profitably increased volumes, made continued progress against our multi-year initiatives and reported earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from successfully executing our strategy and a steady improvement in solid waste trends. 
Some of our second quarter and year-to-date highlights include second quarter EPS was $0.54; the second quarter benefited approximately $0.03 due to a lower tax rate. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $410 million, which was in line with our expectations. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year and our full year guidance. Core price in the second quarter was 3.8% and average yield was 2.4%. The sequential improvement in yield performance reflects an increase in the level of pricing, a favorable reduction in rollbacks and an improvement in the impact from churn. Each of these components of average yield has benefited from our revenue enhancing initiatives. This is the second straight quarter of reporting average yield in excess of 2%, while growing volumes in excess of 1%, which clearly demonstrates our ability to grow both price and volumes simultaneously. 
Second quarter volumes increased 1.1%, which was broad-based geographically and included positive contribution from our collection and disposal lines of business. The year-to-date investment in solid waste acquisitions was $116 million. This includes our normal tuck-in transactions and approximately $18 million of consideration for a LIFO side agreement to operate the Sonoma County landfill and transfer station network. We commenced operations of Sonoma County on April 1 of this year. The integration of Tervita is going well and on track with our plan. Performance has been short of our original expectations due to a sharper decline in the rig counts and drilling activity. But we remain pleased with the people and the quality of the assets. We are well-positioned to take advantage of a recovery in this business. 
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 5.1 million shares repurchased for $205 million. We have $155 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30, an increase of approximately 7%. We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, further differentiate our service offerings and reduce costs. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture pricing tool. 75% of our sales force has been changed on priority-based selling, or PBS. We expect PBS to be fully rolled out by the end of the year. Nearly 1 million customers have enrolled in the My Resource customer portal and app and finally, we have approximately 350 contracts with more than $150 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for the annual price adjustment. 
We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices that more closely align with our cost structure. Regarding our fleet. 15% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas, 70% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 70% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet Maintenance program. 
With respect to our recycling business. Average recycling commodity prices remain below the 10-year average, which continues to put pressure on our results. Most of our recycling business is performed on behalf of our municipal customers under multi-year contracts. As these contracts come to term, we are focused on renegotiating terms that contain the elements most important to us, including increasing processing and service fees that allow us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return and implementing a commodity revenue share mechanism that fluctuates with commodity markets but also incentivizes customers to send us clean and valuable material. 
We expect it will take several years to realize the full impact of our efforts, given the long term nature of these recycling contracts. In the open market, where we do not have the same contractual limitations, we have already taken the following three actions: First, we increased rates charged for recycling collection services to be more in line with solid waste services; second, we increased amounts charged for processing materials at our recycling facilities; and finally, we adjusted the rebates paid to third parties for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. We believe that improving the profitability of the recycling business ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We are raising our full year financial guidance as follows based on our expected outperformance for the year. We now expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.05. Our original guidance was $1.98 to $2.04. We now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $720 million to $745 million. Our original guidance was $710 million to $740 million. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. The 3.7% increased revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows:",872,"Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. The 3.7% increased revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows: First, average yield growth, 2.4%; average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business; 4.4% yield in the large container investor business; and a 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 0.9%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.4%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.9% in a restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 1.1% year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.3%, which includes positive contributions from the commercial business of 0.5%. The industrial business of 1.9% and the residential business of 1.8%. Our commercial volume performance of 0.5% includes a 30-basis-point decline due to non renewing select National Accounts customers and laws [ph] performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-repeatable[ph]. 
The Post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 0.6%. Landfill was up 0.9%, which includes positive contribution from MSW of 4% and C&D of 1.9%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 2.1%. Special waste volumes were up 0.8%, excluding the decrease in same store E&P waste streams. The sequential decline in our volume performance since the first quarter was expected since we had a tougher comparison in the prior period. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.85 in the second quarter from $3.94 in the prior year, a decrease of 28%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. 
We will cover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 11% to an average price of $97 per ton in the second quarter from $109 per ton in the prior year. June commodity prices were approximately $100 per ton. 
Second quarter recycling volume of 655,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year. Excluding that acquisitions, volumes were down approximately 6%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Overall, we've experienced greater than anticipated headwind for our recycling business, primarily due to recycling collection. 
Within recycling collection, we are receiving less than anticipated rebates for materials delivered to third-party facilities. The lower rebates, which are recorded as part of our recycled commodity revenue, reduced second quarter EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to our original expectations. We recognize this headwind and implemented additional price increases in the open market to help mitigate the impact. This pricing action explains some of the sequential increase in core price and average yields compared to our first quarter results. Our material recycling facilities performed in line with our expectations. Now, we'll discuss changes in margin. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year. Large [ph] expansions from the solid waste business, which includes lower fuel cost, was offset by the impact of lower recycling commodity prices and E&P waste services. 
Our E&P waste business includes transition and integration cost from our recent acquisition of Tervita. There was a 250-basis-point reduction in revenue due to a decline in fuel recovery fees and lower recycled commodity prices. As a result, certain cost line items increased as a percentage of revenue. This was most prominent in the larger categories. For example, the decline in fuel recovery fees in commodity revenue resulted in an increase in labor of 40 basis points, maintenance of 20 basis points and SG&A expenses of 20 basis points, as a percentage of revenue. The remaining increases in these 3 cost categories primarily relates to the mix of volume growth and integration cost. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations in SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Second quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 36.3% in the second quarter and 37.8% on a year-to-date basis. The lower tax rate in the second quarter reflects a $0.03 benefit from favorably settling certain tax matters. We expect that effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the second half of the year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $410 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of cash taxes and working capital. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Don."

It might be, and that tied to an index but have a 2%, 3%, 4% increase already built in to the contract. Those might be large industrial accounts, they can be National Accounts, things like that. So what moves the pricing in that part of the business is just our further commitment to pricing intelligently our business and knowing when to walk away from business. We mentioned, Chuck mentioned his results  that, in his comments, that one of the things that impacted volume was some loss of some National Accounts business and some broker business that we define as non-regrettable. So we're going to continue to look at business and all customers are created equally. So the Capture tool,  the PBS training that we talked about, all those things are proving valuable throughout our business. We're going to continue to move price. We think now, with what we've been seeing, that price for the full year will be closer to 2% based on all of these actions."

So we have put an incredible focus on customer experience and service delivery, on our fleet initiatives. So our fleet is more reliable today. Our customer delivery is better. We think we're extending customer loyalty and we think we're earning that price increase more easily from our customers. So that's at work. I think we're easier to do business with them than we were 1 year or 2 years ago. So we're increasing the value proposition. That's part of it. We're going out with higher price increases. We have more confidence in earning that price increase or asking for a little higher price in the open market and getting it. Specifically, also, on the recycling business in the open market, we've delayed that recycling, commodity prices dropped pretty quickly in the first half of the year. We're right to work on pricing that open market recycling business and as we said in our comments, we've moved the pricings up substantially in that segment. So that's driving it. Certainly, when there's volume growth in the marketplace, market dynamics change. Generally speaking, I think competition is less likely to go out aggressively for compatible waste streams than they're getting waste streams organically. So I think that's happening. I think that's a sort of normal supply and demand kind of activity that happens in the marketplace. We are using our tools, right? So Capture is rolled out to all of our areas across the country. That gives us -- that makes us more efficient in talking to customers and calling our new accounts to make the selling process better and more desirable and enjoyable for our customers. And it gives us better pricing control at that point of decision. So that's happening. That's helping that churn. And then PBS tied to that also have refined our sales compensation plans, et cetera. So there's a lot of work inside the company that's doing that. So  again, a normal growth environment organically would be a better market to get pricing. And then obviously, on the municipal side of the business, we talked about moving a portion of that business to the better index. And so every quarter now, we reported an increase in moving more customers to the new index that's more in line with our cost structure. We're going to continue that hard work. And over time, we will move the needle consistently and basically, kind of reimagine how we price municipal customers because we have to have an index that's fair. So at the mouthful, all those things working together for the greater good here."

So I'll tell you what's happened historically when we've seen downcycles in recycling is just about the time when the market starts to sort of revolt and raise prices and maybe constrain some service, the volume and or the commodity prices bounce back and then the market doesn't really change that much. So the fact that this has been so steep and I would say sustained probably causes the market to maybe take a closer look at it. So we're doing that. As I've said, we had great luck with moving prices forward in the open market, which says, frankly, customers who are willing to pay are almost as much for recycling as waste. And we've done a lot of customer insight work, our marketing group here and customers are telling us that. It's important. It's really important to them, they're willing to pay for it. So customer demand, should a company willingness to pay, and that's our view. Now in the open markets, one thing is the contractual obligations that we have with customers are different shorter-term, a lot of our recycling is done with municipalities, those are longer term contracts, as I said in my comments, those will take longer to term. But I guarantee you this, our team here, our recycling group, our operating group, our sales team, our pricing team, all working very diligently together to think about how we're going to,  as I said, reimagine the recycling business here in the future. And our view is that it's not going to be the same way that it occurs today. It just can't be. And so the overarching point there is if we want recycling to really, truly be sustainable, sustainability can't happen without consistent profitability. It's just impossible. And so we have to find a new way to make the model truly sustainable. Therefore, sustainably your or business profitable. That's again a mouthful. But that's what we're working on. We're still committed to it because our customers want it. And I said if they really demand it, then that should be a company with willingness to pay."

And that reduction in revenue is driving a increase in those costs in terms of a percentage of revenue. So if you -- some of the line items that you called out or some of the larger cost categories. So in terms of labor, that's about 40% or 40 basis points of the overall increase. It's about 20 basis points on the maintenance side, and just for reference, it's 20 basis points on the SG&A also. So you have to take that into consideration when you're looking at the basis point increase year-over-year. The other thing that we need to take into consideration is the mix of business year-over-year. As we've mentioned, the volume increases that we've gotten have really been focused in on the industrial business and on the residential business. And there's not as much of our ability to leverage those cost isn't quite as great as some of the other cost categories. So next remember, too, we got acquisitions year-over-year. We got volume growth. And as it relates to maintenance specifically, we pointed out a couple of times before why we're very pleased with the One Fleet initiative and that's exactly the right thing to do. When we started that program, we did not see some of the fleet complexity coming our way. So we do have some cost increases coming from the new cleaner engines and some of that. So -- and I'll just remind everybody, we didn't talk about it here on the call, but one of the paybacks on One Fleet is the aging fleet in methodical fashion and getting that CapEx savings that we've talked about a number of times, one time $200 million savings, plus the ongoing benefit of running fleet types, that's about a year older, which is about $15 million a year in CapEx. So mainly specifically, we're getting a great payback on that."

And what we've been talking about lately is about $800 million of that piece is the smaller municipal contract, generally residential only, call it a 5-year contract. So that $800 million, that's the first piece that we've been working on, the move to a new index. We've now moved $150 million of that business, $150 million to 800 to a new index, that's confirmed. So working on the balance. As you would expect, logically, when we try to change how this occurs to our customers and then within the market, we will start with smaller contracts and having good success. The remaining $1.7 billion is larger contracts and franchise agreements that tend to run a lot longer than 5 years and also include, oftentimes, commercial, small container, large container business. So we're up to 150 out of the targeted 800. We're progressing every quarter. We don't know how far it will go. We're certainly making strong arguments and frankly successful arguments for it. And we'll continue to do it. Again, the overarching issue here is, in these kind of public-private partnerships, you got to be mutually beneficial. It's unrealistic for our municipal partners to expect us to settle for an index that doesn't adequately cover our inflation. So we have to cover our inflation, net of productivity, on a consistent basis. That's reasonable, it's fair, and that's one of the reasons we're getting it done. The fact that there is this water sewer trash index, something we can point to that's been in use now for what, 15 years or whatever, is helping.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter.

The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of core price and average yield, profitably increased volumes, made continued progress against our multi-year initiatives and reported earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from successfully executing our strategy and a steady improvement in solid waste trends. 
Some of our second quarter and year-to-date highlights include second quarter EPS was $0.54; the second quarter benefited approximately $0.03 due to a lower tax rate. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $410 million, which was in line with our expectations. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year and our full year guidance. Core price in the second quarter was 3.8% and average yield was 2.4%. The sequential improvement in yield performance reflects an increase in the level of pricing, a favorable reduction in rollbacks and an improvement in the impact from churn. Each of these components of average yield has benefited from our revenue-enhancing initiatives. This is the second straight quarter of reporting average yield in excess of 2%, while growing volumes in excess of 1%, which clearly demonstrates our ability to grow both price and volumes simultaneously. 
Second quarter volumes increased 1.1%, which was broad-based geographically and included positive contribution from our collection and disposal lines of business. The year-to-date investment in solid waste acquisitions was $116 million. This includes our normal tuck-in transactions and approximately $80 million of consideration for a LIFO side agreement to operate the Sonoma County landfill and transfer station network. We commenced operations of Sonoma County on April 1 of this year. The integration of Tervita is going well and on track with our plan. Performance has been short of our original expectations due to a sharper decline in the rig counts and drilling activity. But we remain pleased with the people and the quality of the assets. We are well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in this business. 
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 5.1 million shares repurchased for $205 million. We have $155 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30, an increase of approximately 7%. We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, further differentiate our service offerings and reduce costs. Regarding our revenue-enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture pricing tool. 75% of our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We expect PBS to be fully rolled out by the end of the year. Nearly 1 million customers have enrolled in the My Resource customer portal and app. And finally, we have approximately 350 contracts with more than $150 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for the annual price adjustment. 
We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices that more closely align with our cost structure. Regarding our fleet. 15% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas, 70% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 70% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. 
With respect to our recycling business. Average recycle commodity prices remained below the 10-year average, which continues to put pressure on our results. Most of our recycling business is performed on behalf of our municipal customers under multi-year contracts. As these contracts come to term, we are focused on renegotiating terms that contain the elements most important to us, including increasing processing and service fees that allow us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return and implementing a commodity revenue share mechanism that fluctuates with commodity markets but also incentivizes customers to send us clean and valuable material. 
We expect it will take several years to realize the full impact of our efforts, given the long-term nature of these recycling contracts. In the open market, where we do not have the same contractual limitations, we have already taken the following 3 actions: First, we increased rates charged for recycling collection services to be more in line with solid waste services; second, we increased amounts charged for processing materials at our recycling facilities; and finally, we adjusted the rebates paid to third parties for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. We believe that improving the profitability of the recycling business ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We are raising our full year financial guidance as follows based on our expected outperformance for the year. We now expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.05. Our original guidance was $1.98 to $2.04. We now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $720 million to $745 million. Our original guidance was $710 million to $740 million. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. The 3.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows",876,"Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. The 3.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows: First, average yield growth, 2.4%; average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business; 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business; and a 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 0.9%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.4%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.9% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 1.1% year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.3%, which includes positive contribution from the commercial business of 0.5%, the industrial business of 1.9% and the residential business of 1.8%. Our commercial volume performance of 0.5% includes a 30 basis point decline due to not renewing select National Accounts customers and worst performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. 
The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 0.6%. Landfill was up 0.9%, which includes positive contribution from MSW of 4% and C&D of 1.9%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 2.1%. Special waste volumes were up 0.8%, excluding the decrease in same store E&P waste streams. The sequential decline in our volume performance since first quarter was expected since we had a tougher comparison in the prior period. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.85 in the second quarter from $3.94 in the prior year, a decrease of 28%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. 
We will cover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 11% to an average price of $97 per ton in the second quarter from $109 per ton in the prior year. June commodity prices were approximately $100 per ton. 
Second quarter recycling volume of 655,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year. Excluding the acquisitions, volumes were down approximately 6%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Overall, we've experienced greater than anticipated headwinds from our recycling business, primarily due to recycling collection. 
Within recycling collection, we are receiving less than anticipated rebates for materials delivered to third-party facilities. The lower rebates, which are recorded as part of our recycled commodity revenue, reduced second quarter EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to our original expectations. We recognize this headwind and implemented additional price increases in the open market to help mitigate the impact. This pricing action explains some of the sequential increase in core price and average yields compared to our first quarter results. Our material recycling facilities performed in line with our expectations. Now we'll discuss changes in margin. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansions from the solid waste business, which includes oil and fuel cost, was offset by the impact of lower recycled commodity prices and E&P waste services. 
Our E&P waste business includes transition and integration cost from our recent acquisition of Tervita. There was a 250 basis point reduction in revenue due to a decline in fuel recovery fees and lower recycled commodity prices. As a result, certain cost line items increased as a percentage of revenue. This was most prominent in the larger cost categories. For example, the decline in fuel recovery fees in commodity revenue resulted in an increase in labor of 40 basis points, maintenance of 20 basis points and SG&A expenses of 20 basis points, as a percentage of revenue. The remaining increases in these 3 cost categories primarily relates to the mix of volume growth and integration cost. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations in SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Second quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 36.3% in the second quarter and 37.8% on a year-to-date basis. The lower tax rate in the second quarter reflects a $0.03 benefit from favorably settling certain tax matters. We expect that effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the second half of the year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $410 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of cash taxes and working capital. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Don."

It might be -- and not tied to an index but have a 2%, 3%, 4% increase already built in to the contract. And those might be large industrial accounts, they can be National Accounts, things like that. So what moves the pricing in that part of the business is just our further commitment to pricing intelligently our business and knowing when to walk away from business. We mentioned, Chuck mentioned his results that, in his comments, that one of the things that impacted volume was some loss of some National Accounts business and some broker business that we define as non-regrettable. So we're going to continue to look at business and all customers aren't created equally. So the Capture tool, the PBS training that we talked about, all those things are proving valuable throughout our business. We're going to continue to move price.

We think we're extending customer loyalty and we think we're earning that price increase more easily from our customers. So that's at work. I think we're easier to do business with them than we were a year and 2 years ago. So we're increasing the value proposition. That's part of it. We're going out with higher price increases. We got more confidence in earning that price increase. We're asking for a little higher price in the open market and getting it. Specifically, also, on the recycling business in the open market, with the way they're recycling, commodity prices dropped pretty quickly in the first half of the year. We went right to work on pricing that open market recycling business. And as we said in our comments, we've moved the prices up substantially in that segment. So that's driving it. Certainly, when there's volume growth in the marketplace, market dynamics change. Generally speaking, I think competition is less likely to go out aggressively for competitive waste streams when they're getting waste streams organically. So I think that's happening. I think that's a sort of normal supply-and-demand kind of activity that happens in the marketplace. We are using our tools, right? So Capture is rolled out to all of our areas across the country. That gives us -- that makes us more efficient in talking to customers and calling our new accounts, it makes the selling process better and more desirable and enjoyable for our customers. And it gives us better pricing control at that point of decision. So that's happening. That's helping effect churn. And then PBS tied to that training, we're also have refined our sales compensation plans, et cetera. So there's a lot of work inside the company that's doing that. Again, a normal growth environment organically would be a better market to get pricing. And then obviously, on the municipal side of the business, we talked about moving a portion of that business to the better index. And so every quarter now, we reported an increase in moving more customers to the new index that's more in line with our cost structure. We're going to continue that hard work. And over time, we will move the needle consistently and basically, kind of reimagine how we price municipal customers because we have to have an index that's fair. So with a mouth full, that all of those things working together for the greater good here."

So I'll tell you what's happened historically when we've seen downcycles in recycling is just about the time the market starts to sort of revolt and raise prices and maybe constrain some service, the volume and/or the commodity prices bounce back and then the market doesn't really change that much. So the fact that this has been so steep and I would say sustained probably causes the market to maybe take a closer look at it. So we're doing that. As I said, we've had great luck with moving prices forward in the open market, which says, frankly, customers who are willing to pay are almost as much for recycling as waste. And we've done a lot of customer inside work, our marketing group here and customers are telling us that. It's important. It's really important to them, they're willing to pay for it. So customer demand, should a company willingness to pay, and that's our view. Now in the open markets, one thing because the contractual obligations that we have with customers are different and shorter term, a lot of our recycling is done with municipalities, those are longer-term contracts, as I said in my comments. Those will take longer to term. But I guarantee you this, our team here, our recycling group, our operating group, our sales team, our pricing team, all working very diligently together to think about how we're going to, as I said, reimagine the recycling business here in the future. And our view is that it's not going to be the same way it occurs today. It just can't be. And so the overarching point there is if we want recycling to really, truly be sustainable, sustainability can't happen without consistent profitability. It's just impossible. And so we got to find a new way to make the model truly sustainable. Therefore, sustainably or consistently profitable. That's again a mouthful. But that's what we're working on. We're still committed to it because our customers want it. And I said if they really demand it, then that should be a company with willingness to pay."

The remaining $1.7 billion is larger contracts and franchise agreements that tend to run a lot longer than 5 years and also include, oftentimes, commercial, small container, large container business. So we're up to $150 million out of the targeted $800 million. We're progressing every quarter. We don't know how far it will go. We're certainly making strong arguments and frankly successful arguments for it. And we'll continue to do it. Again, the overarching issue here is, in these kind of public-private partnerships, they got to be mutually beneficial. It's unrealistic for our municipal partners to expect us to settle for an index that doesn't adequately cover our inflation. So we got to cover our inflation, net of productivity, on a consistent basis. That's reasonable, it's fair, and that's one of the reasons we're getting it done. The fact that there is this water, sewer, trash index, something we can point to that's been in use now for what, 15 years or whatever, is helping. And so it's too early to tell how long is it going to take and how far it's going to go. I can tell you this, we're not going to stop pushing. And that's -- we'll update you every quarter as we go through time. That's certainly helping and we'll certainly show some benefit into next year."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter.

The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of core price and average yield, profitably increased volumes, made continued progress against our multiyear initiatives and reported earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from successfully executing our strategy and a steady improvement in solid waste trends. 
Some of our second quarter and year-to-date highlights include second quarter EPS was $0.54; the second quarter benefited approximately $0.03 due to a lower tax rate. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $410 million, which was in line with our expectations. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year and our full year guidance. Core price in the second quarter was 3.8%, and average yield was 2.4%. The sequential improvement in yield performance reflects an increase in the level of pricing, a favorable reduction in rollbacks and an improvement in the impact from churn. Each of these components of average yield has benefited from our revenue-enhancing initiatives. This is the second straight quarter of reporting average yield in excess of 2%, while growing volumes in excess of 1%, which clearly demonstrates our ability to grow both price and volumes simultaneously. 
Second quarter volumes increased 1.1%, which was broad based geographically and included positive contribution from our collection and disposal lines of business. The year-to-date investment in solid waste acquisitions was $116 million. This includes our normal tuck-in transactions and approximately $80 million of consideration for a license site agreement to operate the Sonoma County landfill and transfer station network. We commenced operations of Sonoma County on April 1 of this year. The integration of Tervita is going well and on track with our plan. Performance has been short of our original expectations due to a sharper decline in the rig counts and drilling activity. But we remain pleased with the people and the quality of the assets. We are well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in this business. 
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 5.1 million shares repurchased for $205 million. We have $155 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete during 2015. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30, an increase of approximately 7%. We continue to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, further differentiate our service offerings and reduce costs. Regarding our revenue-enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture pricing tool. 75% of our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We expect PBS to be fully rolled out by the end of the year. Nearly 1 million customers have enrolled in the My Resource customer portal and app. And finally, we have approximately 350 contracts with more than $150 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for the annual price adjustment. 
We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices that more closely align with our cost structure. Regarding our fleet. 15% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 70% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 70% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. 
With respect to our recycling business. Average recycle commodity prices remained below the 10-year average, which continues to put pressure on our results. Most of our recycling business is performed on behalf of our municipal customers under multiyear contracts. As these contracts come to term, we are focused on renegotiating terms that contain the elements most important to us, including increasing processing and service fees that allow us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return and implementing a commodity revenue share mechanism that fluctuates with commodity markets but also incentivizes customers to send us clean and valuable material. 
We expect it will take several years to realize the full impact of our efforts, given the long-term nature of these recycling contracts. In the open market, where we do not have the same contractual limitations, we have already taken the following 3 actions: First, we increased rates charged for recycling collection services to be more in line with solid waste services; second, we increased amounts charged for processing materials at our recycling facilities; and finally, we adjusted the rebates paid to third parties for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. We believe that improving the profitability of the recycling business ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We are raising our full year financial guidance as follows based on our expected outperformance for the year. We now expect diluted EPS to be in a range of $2.02 to $2.05. Our original guidance was $1.98 to $2.04. We now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $720 million to $745 million. Our original guidance was $710 million to $740 million. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. This 3.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follow",870,"Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. This 3.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows: First, average yield growth, 2.4%; average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes a 3.6% yield in the small-container commercial business; 4.4% yield in the large-container industrial business; and a 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 0.9%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.4%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.9% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 1.1% year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.3%, which includes positive contribution from the commercial business of 0.5%, the industrial business of 1.9% and the residential business of 1.8%. Our commercial volume performance of 0.5% includes a 30 basis point decline due to not renewing select National Accounts customers and worst performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as nonregrettable. 
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 0.6%. Landfill was up 0.9%, which includes positive contribution from MSW of 4% and C&D of 1.9%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 2.1%. Special waste volumes were up 0.8%, excluding the decrease in same store E&P waste streams. The sequential decline in our volume performance since first quarter was expected since we had a tougher comparison in the prior period. 
Next. Fuel recovery fees decreased 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.85 in the second quarter from $3.94 in the prior year, a decrease of 28%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. 
We will cover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 11% to an average price of $97 per ton in the second quarter from $109 per ton in the prior year. June commodity prices were approximately $100 per ton. 
Second quarter recycling volume of 655,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were down approximately 6%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Overall, we've experienced greater-than-anticipated headwinds from our recycling business, primarily due to recycling collection. 
Within recycling collection, we are receiving less-than-anticipated rebates for materials delivered to third-party facilities. The lower rebates, which are recorded as part of our recycled commodity revenue, reduced second quarter EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to our original expectations. We recognize this headwind and implemented additional price increases in the open market to help mitigate the impact. This pricing action explains some of the sequential increase in core price and average yields compared to our first quarter results. Our material recycling facilities performed in line with our expectations. Now I will  discuss changes in margin. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansions from the solid waste business, which includes lower fuel cost, was offset by the impact of lower recycled commodity prices and E&P waste services. 
Our E&P waste business includes transition and integration cost from our recent acquisition of Tervita. There was a 250 basis point reduction in revenue due to a decline in fuel recovery fees and lower recycled commodity prices. As a result, certain cost line items increased as a percentage of revenue. This was most prominent in the larger cost categories. For example, the decline in fuel recovery fees and commodity revenue resulted in an increase in labor of 40 basis points, maintenance of 20 basis points and SG&A expenses of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The remaining increases in these 3 cost categories primarily relates to the mix of volume growth and integration cost. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Second quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 36.3% in the second quarter and 37.8% on a year-to-date basis. The lower tax rate in the second quarter reflects a $0.03 benefit from favorably settling certain tax matters. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the second half of the year. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $410 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of cash taxes and working capital. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Don."

It might be -- not tied to an index but have a 2%, 3%, 4% increase already built into the contract. And those might be large industrial accounts. They could be National Accounts, things like that. So what moves the pricing in that part of the business is just our further commitment to pricing intelligently our business and knowing when to walk away from business. We mentioned -- Chuck mentioned in his results that -- in his comments that one of the things that impacted volume was some loss of some National Accounts business and some broker business that we define as nonregrettable. So we're going to continue to look at business, and all customers aren't created equally. So the Capture tool, the PBS training that we talked about, all those things are proving valuable throughout our business. We're going to continue to move price.

So we have put an incredible focus on customer experience and service delivery, on our fleet initiatives. So our fleet is more reliable today. Our customer delivery is better. We think we're extending customer loyalty, and we think we're earning that price increase more easily from our customers. So that's at work. I think we're easier to do business with them than we were a year and 2 years ago. So we're increasing the value proposition. That's part of it. We're going out with higher price increases. We've got more confidence in earning that price increase. We're asking for a little higher price in the open market and getting it. Specifically, also on the recycling business in the open market, with the way that recycling  commodity prices dropped pretty quickly in the first half of the year, we went right to work on pricing that open market recycling business. And as we said in our comments, we've moved the prices up substantially in that segment. So that's driving it. Certainly, when there's volume growth in the marketplace, market dynamics change. Generally speaking, I think competition is less likely to go out aggressively for competitive waste streams when they're getting waste streams organically. So I think that's happening. I think that's just sort of normal supply-and-demand kind of activity that happens in a marketplace. We are using our tools, right? So Capture is rolled out to all of our areas across the country. That gives us -- it makes us more efficient in talking to customers and calling on new accounts. It makes the selling process better and more desirable and enjoyable for our customers. And it gives us better pricing control at that point of decision. So that's happening. That's helping effect churn. And then PBS. Tied to that training, we're also have refined our sales compensation plans, et cetera. So there's a lot of work inside the company that's doing that. Again, a normal growth environment organically would be a better market to get price in. And then obviously, on the municipal side of the business, we talked about moving a portion of that business to the better index. And so every quarter now, we reported an increase in moving more customers to the new index that's more in line with our cost structure. We're going to continue that hard work. And over time, we will move the needle consistently and basically kind of reimagine how we price municipal customers because we have to have an index that's fair. So it's a mouth full, but all of those things working together for the greater good here."

So I'll tell you what's happened historically when we've seen down cycles in recycling is just about the time the market starts to sort of revolt and raise prices and maybe constrain some service the volume or the commodity prices bounce back, and then the market doesn't really change that much. So the fact that this has been so steep and I would say sustained probably causes the market to maybe take a closer look at it, so. Certainly we're doing that. As I said, we've had great luck with moving prices forward in the open market, which says, frankly, customers are willing to pay almost as much for recycling as waste. And we've done a lot of customer inside work, our marketing group here, and customers are telling us that. It's important. If it's really important to them, they're willing to pay for it. So customer demand, should a company willingness to pay, and that's our view. Now in the -- the open market is one thing because the contractual obligations that we have with customers are different and shorter term. A lot of our recycling is done with municipalities. Those are longer-term contracts, as I said in my comments. Those will take longer to turn. But I guarantee you this, our team here, our recycling group, our operating group, our sales team, our pricing team, all working very diligently together to think about how we're going to, as I said, reimagine the recycling business here of the future. And our view is that it's not going to be the same way it occurs today. It just can't be. And so, the overarching point there is if we want recycling to really, truly be sustainable, sustainability can't happen without consistent profitability. It's just impossible. And so we've got to find a new way to make the model truly sustainable, therefore sustainably or consistently profitable. That's again a mouthful. But that's what we're working on. We're still committed to it because our customers want it. And as I said, if they really demand it, then that should be a company with willingness to pay."

So we've said that approximately, what, $2.4 billion of our business is that, again, the 30%, right, so is restricted to some type of index.

So we've said that approximately, what, $2.4 billion of our business is that, again, the 30%, right, so is restricted to some type of index. And we've been talking about lately is about $800 million of that piece is the smaller municipal contract, generally residential only, call it a 5-year contract. So that $800 million, that's the first piece we've been working on to move to a new index. We've now moved $150 million of that business, $150 million to $800 million to a new index,. That's confirmed. Still working on the balance. As you would expect, logically, when we try to change how this occurs with our customers and then within the market, we would start with smaller contracts and having good success. The remaining $1.7 billion is larger contracts and franchise agreements that tend to run a lot longer than 5 years and also include, oftentimes, commercial, small container, large container business. So we're up to $150 million out of the targeted $800 million. We're progressing every quarter. We don't know how far it will go. We're certainly making strong arguments and, frankly. successful arguments for it. And we'll continue to do it. Again, the overarching issue here is in these kind of public-private partnerships they've got to be mutually beneficial. It's unrealistic for our municipal partners to expect us to settle for an index that doesn't adequately cover our inflation. So we got to cover our inflation, net of productivity, on a consistent basis. That's reasonable. It's fair, and that's one of the reasons we're getting it done. The fact that there is this water, sewer, trash index, something we can point to that's been in use now for what, 15 years or whatever, is helping. And so I -- it's too early to tell how long is it going to take and how far it's going to go. I can tell you this, we're not going to stop pushing. And that's -- we'll update you every quarter as we go through time. That's certainly helping, and we'll certainly show some benefit into next year."

Our third quarter results represent another solid performance by the Republic team. 
We continue to successfully execute our plan, resulting in improved pricing, positive volumes and growth in earnings and free cash flow. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic initiatives, while capitalizing on the steady improvement in solid waste trends. Some of our third quarter and year-to-date highlights include, third quarter EPS was $0.53, and year-to-date free cash flow was $603 million, both performance measures were inline with our expectations. 
Third quarter EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which is consistent with the prior year. Year-to-date EBITDA margin was 28.4%, which is inline with our full year guidance. 
Core price in the third quarter was 3.6% and average yield was 2.5%. The sequential increase in yield performance reflects an improvement in the level of churn. We define churn as the revenue per unit difference between new and lost business.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points, our collection volumes increased 1.1%, which continues to demonstrate that we can grow price and volume simultaneously. 
During the quarter, we invested $24 million in tuck-in acquisitions at a post synergy EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.5x. 
We remain on track to invest approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions this year.
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $600 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase since the beginning of the year. This includes 7.4 million shares repurchased for $298 million. 
Our board recently approved a $900 million increase to our existing share repurchase authorization and extended the term through December 2017. 
We continue to make progress on multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. 
Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our capture cloud-based pricing tool. 90% of our sales force has been trained on priority based selling or PBS. We will be fully rolled out by the end of the year. 
We are seeing very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform, approximately 1.1 million customers have enrolled in our My Resource customer portal and mobile app, significantly enhancing our customer interaction and connectivity. 
And finally, regarding our municipal business, we have over 400 contracts with approximately $200 million in annual revenue that now use in alternative index for their annual price adjustment.
All of these revenue enhancing initiatives are designed to improve the customer experience and further differentiate our services from the competition, which adds value to our offering, builds customer loyalty and increases willingness to pay. 
Importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these initiatives as evidenced by our fourth straight quarters of sequential pricing improvement and highest level of reported average yield since 2009. 
Regarding our fleet, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 71% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 74% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. 
Turning to our recycling business. We remain focused on converting to a fee-based model with a more equitable commodity sharing mechanism. This allows us to recover our cost and earn a reasonable return on capital deployed, while reducing earnings volatility from fluctuating recycle commodity prices.
We've advance this initiative and are making progress. For example, we met with most of our municipal customers with processing contracts are coming to determine in the next 24 months. We are educating them on the economics of recycling and the need to transition to a more durable model. 
To give you some context on why this is achievable, we recently were successful in transitioning one of our large municipal recycling contracts to a fee-based processing model. 
This customer values are recycling services and wants to ensure the liability of recycling for their community. Additionally, we remain purposeful when renewing existing contracts or considering new business opportunities. 
In situations where the customer is unwilling to consider more equitable terms, we are simply choosing not to participate. 
It will take time to realize the full impact of our efforts, since most of our recycle business has performed on behalf of municipal customers under multi-year contracts. 
But we remain committed since recycling is a core component of our business. We believe that improving the profitability of recycling, ensures it's sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. Chuck, will now discuss the financial results."

Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76  million the prior year. The 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows:  Fi",838,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76  million the prior year. The 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows:  First, average yield growth of 2.5%: Average yield in the collection business was 3.2%, which includes 3.6% is in the small container commercial business; 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business; and 1.6% yield in the residential business. 
Average yield in the post collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1%. Core price, which measures price increases that of rollbacks was 3.6%. Core price consisted of 4.7% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our volume increased 60 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.1%, which includes positive contribution from the industrial business of 2.5% and the residential business of 1%. The Commercial business was flat with the prior year. 
Our commercial volume performance includes 40 basis point decline from non losses of select National Accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. The post collection business made up of third party landfills and transfer station volumes, decreased 1.1%. 
Landfill decreased 1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 3.3% and C&D of 6.2% offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 6.7%. 
Approximately half of the decline in landfill special waste relates event driven jobs and the rest of the decline relates to same-store E&P volumes. It should be noted, that we had very tough comparison in the prior year, since we accepted a record level of special waste in the third quarter of 2014.
Now, fuel recovery fees decreased, next fuel recovery decreased by 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately $35 million compared to the prior year. 
The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.63 in the third quarter from $3.84 in the prior year, a decrease of 31%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs to our fuel recovery fee program. 
Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedge using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income.
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily, relates to a decrease from recycle commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 15% to an average price of $99 per ton in the third quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. 
Current commodity prices were approximately $96 per ton.
Third quarter recycling volume of 673,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 20% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 5%, primarily due to an increase in lower margin of compost sales. 
Cost of goods sold for a recycle commodities was flat to the prior year. Now, I'll discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which was consistent with the prior year. 
Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 50 basis points was offset by the impact of recent acquisitions of 30 basis points and lower recycle commodity prices of 20 basis points. 
The 50 basis point expansion in the solid waste business consisted of lower fuel cost of 50 basis points and price in excess of cost inflation of 20 basis points, which was partially offset by a change in business mix of 20 basis points.
The change in business mix results from volume growth in our collection business offset by volume declines in our higher margin landfill business. 
The change in landfill volumes exclusively relates to decline in special waste times. During the quarter, we saw margin expansion in all of our solid waste lines of business with the exception of landfill. Given the fixed cost nature of the landfill business, a decrease in volume generally results in a decline in margin.
And looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue. There was an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and sale of recycle commodity revenue. For example, the 2.1% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 30 basis points, repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points, and SG&A expense of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost operations in SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Third quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. 
Our effective tax rate was 38.6% in the third quarter and 38.1% on a year-to-date basis. 
During the quarter, we recorded an insurance recovery of $50 million or $0.08 of EPS related to our closed Bridgeton Landfill. We remove this benefit from our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter and full year financial guidance. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

Before closing, I would like to discuss 2016 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. we are currently midway through our annual planning process, and based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following:  EPS of $2.13 to $2.17, which includes $0.03 headwind from a noncash increase in our effective tax rate. If you exclude the tax rate headwind, EPS would be projected at $2.16 to $2.20 or 6% to 8% growth from the midpoint of our 2015 EPS guidance. 
Adjusted free cash flow of $790 million to $810 million. This represents 8% to 10% growth over the midpoint of our 2015 free cash flow guidance.
I want to remind you that approximately 30% of our revenue is restricted based on CPI. Given the low CPI and recycle commodity price environment, we believe our projected earnings and free cash flow growth is strong and reflects the benefits of strategic initiatives of delivering to offset headwinds that are outside of our control. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2016. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. As a result of improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, we expanded solid waste margins by simultaneously growing price and volume. Made meaningful progress of structurally changing recycling contracts in the use of alternative indices in our municipal customers. Generated earnings and free cash flow growth, keeping us well-positioned to achieve our full year 2015 financial guidance. And added $900 million to our existing share repurchase authorization demonstrating our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders.
As we look forward, we expect this positive momentum to continue into 2016. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, our communities, employees and of course, our owners. 
We remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.

But first, for 15 for the quarter, it was good volume growth, remember there were couple of issues in that, 1 is the year-over-year comp on special waste. Last year as Chuck said in Q3, we had a record special waste quarter. 
So still had a strong quarter in special waste in 2015. And the pipeline still robust, just don't have a tough comp. And also, we said in the comments, we kind of walked away from some business, it's a non-regrettable loss it's in and around in national accounts in some of our broker portfolio. So that was came in upsize in the quarter this year. 
So and we frankly look at our volumes in C&D and our large container business, the manufacturing business. As we said, as we go through the year, sequentially, we'd see the growth come down just because the comps got topper, but we still saw plus 2% growth in those lines. 
As we said all along, our growth is heavily dependent on household starts, good special waste flow, good construction business leads to formation in more broad recovery. So for 2016, we're expecting positive growth to continue. And of course, when you look at our year-over-year guidance that we did provide or preliminary outlook pretty strong cash flow growth, you can hopefully see that we expect that trend to continue in 16 for us."

Let me explain it this way, so you're right, the maintenance cost year-over-year about 60 basis points.

Let me explain it this way, so you're right, the maintenance cost year-over-year about 60 basis points. So as we think about that, about 20 basis points relates to the reduction in the fuel recovery fee and the commodity of revenue. About 10 basis points is the mix of business that I discussed earlier. So that's the higher collection portion of the business in the lower landfill business. And about another 20 basis points then is increasing complexity associated with the fleet, which we've been talking about for a while now. 
And so keep in mind, we're about 75%, 74% certified on a One Fleet initiative, we're closer to 90% actually rolled out that last sort of 15% hasn't been certified yet. We'll have One Fleet completed sort of mid- next year and start to sort of realize all those benefits. As we said, we're beginning to very methodically extend use of the fleet, we'll do over the next, continue over the next 3 or 4 years. So we're very happy with our fleet initiative is paying off. We think, we're going to have most reliable fleet in the industry here by the time we grow this fleet couple the next year. And we'll be well-positioned to deal with the fleet complexity issues as they come. So and again, really the issue in margin is the mixed stuff that Chuck described."

We talked about loan capture, which is our tablet based tool, and our tire sales force now is using the Capture tool. So we've got -- as we have said, the goal there was to have much better control the point of sale and decision making process, also making that sales team more efficient and effective. The PBS training, we've talked about extensively, really targeting more successfully customers that have a more willingness to pay and more sort of interest in value. 
That's all happening. We're actually going out a little more price, because we think customer base is willing to take it, and we frankly, I think our service levels have increased. Through fleet reliability, lowering turnover, improving our customer commitments and so and so forth. 
So we think all of that happening from the efforts that we're undertaking as well as frankly the markets rational. And there is some positive growth in the market. And even the more irrational smaller competitors tend to be more rational, when they are some positive organic growth. So I think all that together is giving us a better answer but we think certainly, some of it is based on the average we've made to be more focused in that area."

So Alex, it's probably little bit too early to still unfortunately to give you the cadence.

And things like service increased levels and those kind of things. 
So it's going to depend on that pace. It's also going to depend on basically, frankly, the market at large and how broadly it's accepted. I think we proven that it can happen. And we started this a little over a year ago in earnest. 
And so we're really happy with the progress. This $200 million is remember on that $800 million municipal vertical. And so we're call it force the way through that. And then, we'll be tackling some of the larger contracts that are in that other $1 billion-plus of municipal business. And at the same time, of course, we're tackling the recycling fees.

And very important that, we have total fleet reliability, One Fleet spend above that, improving reliability in the fleet, which we think improves employee engagement and improves driver turnover, and improve service levels. It improves our brand and so on, and so on, and so on. it everything we do. So that's what we port ourselves into One Fleet. It also allows us to again methodically extend useful life of the fleet. Again, which now we're second year in a row, now we're taking benefit in doing that. Again very methodically over 4, 5 year period not just open a switch, but with a better fleet overall. 
So yes. It run through the organization. So again, churn is the difference in revenue per unit between gained and loss business. That's kind of simple right. So we're also selling new business at a higher rate than we were last year. 
So if you signed up with it last year, you would have maybe paid a slightly lower rate per unit and now we're selling more value or you're paying a higher rate per unit. So we watch that as well. So we're addressing it fundamentally in the operations through being a better service provider, creating a better customer experience and we're doing it through sales efforts and all of our tools and then sort of our centralized control on RPM et cetera. All those things got to work together to really drive churns right direction. Again, as I said, the fact that the market is rational and as organic growth that certainly helps our cost."

And our recycling business today is improving, because we're improving operating cost, because we're shutting facilities, we're also investing in some facilities, where we have good public-private partnerships ruling the paper recycling. But we're going to change the model, because we've got this macro thing going on with China, don't know how long it's going to last, but that's the new norm, we can't live in that norm, we got to live in a different world, and that's the conversation we had with the large customer that we described. 
So that gives me great hope that we can do it. We certainly have the appetite to do it, and we're not going to have a business that doesn't return it's cost of capital and give us good earnings results. 
On the new indices, it's the same thing. A $0.04 headwind next year, because CPI is going to knock us on our can. So can live that way. We have about $0.03 of every -- $0.03 for every dollar revenue around here goes to pay people. Right, we are a people intensive business, we're capital intensive business. And that replace trucks containers, got to pay your people well, and if you want to attract the best people and those people expect earnings and increases and healthcare is getting cheaper right. So CPI doesn't cut it. And for your business own or out there and you want to live with 0.5% price increases in your contracts, you're going toe be said, by the time, you get the contract. 
That's we to live in through. So we can found other ways around it now. We find this said enough is enough last year, and we started to move the index out. And a lot of people said, it couldn't be done, the market won't go forward. We now have got 25% of that market vertical converted. We're not stopping there. It just a matter of the pace. And again, we're going to make the appropriate returns for our owners in this business.

So we got to buy whatever it is, 1,000 trucks a year as 1 roll off. And we're replacing those in some cases with CNG. So we're not going out and accelerating our fleet purchases, just because natural gas is a good deal.

Our third quarter results represent another solid performance by the Republic team. 
We continue to successfully execute our plan, resulting in improved pricing, positive volumes and growth in earnings and free cash flow. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic initiatives while capitalizing on the steady improvement in solid waste trends. Some of our third quarter and year-to-date highlights include: third quarter EPS was $0.53 and year-to-date free cash flow was $603 million. Both performance measures were in line with our expectations. 
Third quarter EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which is consistent with the prior year. Year-to-date EBITDA margin was 28.4%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Core price in the third quarter was 3.6% and average yield was 2.5%. The sequential increase in yield performance reflects an improvement in the level of churn. We define churn as the revenue per unit difference between new and lost business.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. Our collection volumes increased 1.1%, which continues to demonstrate that we can grow price and volume simultaneously. During the quarter, we invested $24 million in tuck-in acquisitions at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.5x.  We remain on track to invest approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions this year.
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $600 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase since the beginning of the year. This includes 7.4 million shares repurchased for $298 million. Our board recently approved a $900 million increase to our existing share repurchase authorization and extended the term through December 2017. 
We continue to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.  Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our capture cloud-based pricing tool. 90% of our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We will be fully rolled out by the end of the year. 
We are seeing very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. Approximately 1.1 million customers have enrolled in our My Resource customer portal and mobile app, significantly enhancing our customer interaction and connectivity. And finally, regarding our municipal business. We have over 400 contracts with approximately $200 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for their annual price adjustment.
All of these revenue-enhancing initiatives are designed to improve the customer experience and further differentiate our services from the competition, which adds value to our offering, builds customer loyalty and increases willingness to pay. Importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these initiatives as evidenced by our fourth straight quarters of sequential pricing improvement and highest level of reported average yield since 2009. 
Regarding our fleet, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 71% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 74% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. 
Turning to our recycling business. We remain focused on converting to a fee-based model with a more equitable commodity revenue sharing mechanism. This allows us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return on capital deployed while reducing earnings volatility from fluctuating recycled commodity prices. We've advanced this initiative and are making progress. For example, we met with most of our municipal customers whose processing contracts are coming to term in the next 24 months. We are educating them on the economics of recycling and the need to transition to a more durable model. 
To give you some context on why this is achievable, we recently were successful in transitioning one of our largest municipal recycling contracts to a fee-based processing model. This customer values our recycling services and wants to ensure the viability of recycling for their community. Additionally, we remain purposeful when renewing existing contracts or considering new business opportunities. 
In situations where the customer is unwilling to consider more equitable terms, we are simply choosing not to participate. 
It will take time to realize the full impact of our efforts, since most of our recycle business has performed on behalf of municipal customers under multiyear contracts. But we remain committed since recycling is a core component of our business. We believe that improving the profitability of recycling ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. 
Chuck will now discuss the financial results."

Landfill decreased 1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 3.3% and C&D at 6.2% offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 6.7%. 
Approximately half of the decline in landfill special waste relates to event-driven jobs and the rest of the decline relates to same-store E&P volumes. It should be noted that we had very tough comparison in the prior year, since we accepted a record level of special waste in the third quarter of 2014.
Now fuel recovery fees decreased -- next, fuel recovery fees decreased by 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $35 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.63 in the third quarter from $3.84 in the prior year, a decrease of 31%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs to our fuel recovery fee program.  Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in $1 million change in annual operating income.
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 15% to an average price of $99 per ton in the third quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton.
Third quarter recycling volume of 673,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 20% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 5%, primarily due to an increase in lower margin compost sales. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat to the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 50 basis points was offset by the impact of recent acquisitions of 30 basis points and lower recycle commodity prices of 20 basis points. 
The 50 basis point expansion in the solid waste business consisted of lower fuel cost of 50 basis points and price in excess of cost inflation of 20 basis points, which was partially offset by a change in business mix of 20 basis points. The change in business mix results from volume growth in our collection business offset by volume declines in our higher-margin landfill business. 
The change in landfill volumes exclusively relates to decline in special waste times. During the quarter, we saw margin expansion in all of our solid waste lines of business with the exception of landfill. Given the fixed cost nature of the landfill business, a decrease in volume generally results in a decline in margin.
And looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue. There is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fee and sale of recycled commodity revenue. For example, the 2.1% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 30 basis points, repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points, and SG&A expense of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Third quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.6% in the third quarter and 38.1% on a year-to-date basis. During the quarter, we recorded an insurance recovery of $50 million or $0.08 of EPS related to our closed Bridgeton Landfill. We removed this benefit from our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter and full year financial guidance. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2016 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. we are currently midway through our annual planning process. And based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions",338,"Thanks, Chuck. Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2016 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. we are currently midway through our annual planning process. And based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following. EPS of $2.13 to $2.17, which includes a $0.03 headwind from a noncash increase in our effective tax rate. If you exclude the tax rate headwind, EPS would be projected at $2.16 to $2.20 or 6% to 8% growth from the midpoint of our 2015 EPS guidance. 
Adjusted free cash flow of $790 million to $810 million. This represents 8% to 10% growth over the midpoint of our 2015 free cash flow guidance.  I want to remind you that approximately 30% of our revenue is restricted based on CPI. Given the low CPI and recycled commodity price environment, we believe our projected earnings and free cash flow growth is strong and reflects the benefits our strategic initiatives are delivering to offset headwinds that are outside of our control. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2016. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. As a result of improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, we expanded solid waste margins by simultaneously growing price and volume; made meaningful progress of structurally changing recycling contracts in the use of alternative indices in our municipal customers; generated earnings and free cash flow growth, keeping us well positioned to achieve our full year 2015 financial guidance; and added $900 million to our existing share repurchase authorization demonstrating our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders.
As we look forward, we expect this positive momentum to continue into 2016. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, our communities, employees and, of course, our owners. We remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. 
At this time operator, we'll open the call for questions."

But first, for '15 for the quarter, it was good volume growth. Remember there were a couple of issues in that. One is the year-over-year comp on special waste. Last year, as Chuck said, in Q3, we had a record special waste quarter. So still had a strong quarter in special waste in 2015. And the pipeline is still robust, just had a tough comp there. And also, we said in the comments, we kind of walked away from some business. It's a non-regrettable loss. It's in around National Accounts in some of our broker portfolio. So that was kind of an upsized event in the quarter this year. So -- and we frankly look at our volumes in C&D and in our large container perm business, the manufacturing business. As we said, as we roll through the year, sequentially, we'd see the growth come down just because the comps got tougher. But we still saw plus 2% growth in those lines. And as we've said all along, our growth is heavily dependent on household starts, good special waste flow. Good construction business leads to business formation and more broad recovery. So for 2016, we're expecting positive growth to continue. And of course, when you look at our year-over-year guidance that we did provide or preliminary outlook of pretty strong cash flow growth, you can hopefully see that we expect that trend to continue in '16 for us."

So we need to get -- we need to have a cost of capital covered in the fee-based. It basically is a more, again, fair value-sharing arrangement. It gives the municipality much more upside. It certainly drives them to produce a better quality volume, right, less contaminated, which is important to the overall value of the material when we sell it. And it just, again, put excess from downside. But as I said in my comments, municipalities that really want to recycle, they want real sustainability. They want the durability to the program for their consumer base, for their rate payers. And this is a fair way to do it. So we made a pretty major switch in one of our largest, if not the largest, contract we have. And that's a good place to start, and we'll continue work through the system as we go forward."

So every month, we're looking at a portion of customer base, gives us the ability and try to understand what price elasticity looks like in a given market, allows us to kind of throttle up or down accordingly. We'll continue to use that process that served us pretty well. So what we think the pricing picture is for next year is baked into the preliminary outlook we provided. Again, we'll give you a much more detail on that in February. But all systems seem to be go and the tools are working. The systems in place are working. The broader market is holding up well. The open market is performing well for us, as I said, pretty rational market overall.  So those are things we need to see.

And whatever -- whether -- what either is driving it down or things that happen as a result of being driven out. So could churn -- one of the biggest more meaningful issues is that you don't have so many missed stops. And missed stops were about the fleet breaking down. And so while we may see R&M up, and everybody is ringing their hands about it, it clearly has introduced a more reliable fleet, which has helped to lower the missed stops and all of those things that happen.

We are a fleet-based operation, right. We're the eighth largest vocational fleet in the nation. Whatever it is, 75% of our revenue comes from our collection business. We make our money with trucks. And very important that we have total fleet reliability. One Fleet spend above that, improving reliability in the fleet, which we think improves employee engagement. It improves driver turnover. It improves service levels. It improves our brand on the street, and so on, and so on, and so on. It affects everything we do. So that's what we poured ourselves into One Fleet. It also allows us to, again, methodically extend useful life of the fleet. Again, which now we're second year in a row, now we're taking benefit in doing that. Again, very methodically over 4-, 5-year period, not just flipping the switch, but with a better fleet overall. So yes, it runs through the whole organization. So again, churn is the difference in revenue per unit between gained and lost business. That's kind of simple right. So we're also selling new business at a higher rate than we were last year. So if you signed up with us last year, you would have maybe paid a slightly lower rate per unit and now we're selling more value or you're paying a higher rate per unit. So we watch that as well. So we're addressing it fundamentally in the operations through being a better service provider, creating a better customer experience and we're doing it through our sales efforts and all of our tools and then sort of our centralized controls on RPM, et cetera. All those things get to work together to really drive churn in the right direction. Again, as I said, the fact that the market is rational and there's organic growth, that certainly helps our cost."

We're actually investing in some facilities where we have good public-private partnerships who were willing to pay for recycling. But we're going to change the model, because we've got this macro thing going on with China. Don't know how long it's going to last, but that's the new norm. We can't live in that norm. We got to live in a different world. And that's the conversation we had with the large customer that we described. So that gives me great hope that we can do it. We certainly have the appetite to do it, and we're not going to have a business that doesn't return its cost of capital and give us good earnings results. On the new indices, it's the same thing. A $0.04 headwind next year, because CPI is going to knock us on our can. So can't live that way. We have about $0.03 of every -- there are $0.03 for every $1 revenue around here goes to pay people, right. We're a people-intensive business. We're a capital-intensive business. And got to replace trucks, containers, got to pay your people well. If you want to attract the best people and those people expect earnings increases. And last I checked health care is not getting cheaper, right. So CPI doesn't cut it. And if you're business owner out there and you're willing to live with 0.5% price increases in your contracts, you're going to be sad by the time you get to the 5th year contract. That's what we've been living through. So we can find other ways around it now. We finally said enough is enough last year, and we started to move the index out. And a lot of people said, it couldn't be done, the market wouldn't go for it. We now have got 25% of that market vertical converted. And we're not stopping there. It's just a matter of the pace. And again, we're going to make the appropriate returns for our owners in this business. We don't have to haul everybody's garbage.

We geared more of our purchase around CNG vehicles to facilities that we already had made the infrastructure investment in, right. So the goal is once the infrastructure is in place to convert the entire fleet at that local division to CNG. So we saw last investment in new infrastructure around CNG in '15 and '14. We're still going through that calculation in '16. But we think CNG still is an overall still a good investment. Remember, we're only converting to CNG for our replacement vehicles. So we've got to buy whatever it is, 1,000 trucks a year as the old ones roll off. And we're replacing those, in some cases, with CNG. And so we're not going out and accelerating our fleet purchases just because natural gas is a good deal. So we like, in almost like everything else we do, we sometimes get criticized for kind of taking the slow play on it. But very slow, methodical, logical and some market shift and move when we think overall. That's the right approach. And so we'll -- you'll see more of that in CNG next year and we're taking in some parts for recycling. We never jumped all in at both fleet.

Our third quarter results represent another solid performance by the Republic team. 
We continue to successfully execute our plan, resulting in improved pricing, positive volumes and growth in earnings and free cash flow. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic initiatives while capitalizing on the steady improvement in solid waste trends. Some of our third quarter and year-to-date highlights include: third quarter EPS was $0.53 and year-to-date free cash flow was $603 million. Both performance measures were in line with our expectations. 
Third quarter EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which is consistent with the prior year. Year-to-date EBITDA margin was 28.4%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Core price in the third quarter was 3.6% and average yield was 2.5%. The sequential increase in yield performance reflects an improvement in the level of churn. We define churn as the revenue per unit difference between new and lost business.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. Our collection volumes increased 1.1%, which continues to demonstrate that we can grow price and volume simultaneously. During the quarter, we invested $24 million in tuck-in acquisitions at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.5x.  We remain on track to invest approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions this year.
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $600 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase since the beginning of the year. This includes 7.4 million shares repurchased for $298 million. Our board recently approved a $900 million increase to our existing share repurchase authorization and extended the term through December 2017. 
We continue to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.  Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool. 90% of our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We will be fully rolled out by the end of the year. 
We are seeing very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. Approximately 1.1 million customers have enrolled in our MyResource customer portal and mobile app, significantly enhancing our customer interaction and connectivity. 
And finally, regarding our municipal business, we have over 400 contracts with approximately $200 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for their annual price adjustment.
All of these revenue-enhancing initiatives are designed to improve the customer experience and further differentiate our services from the competition, which adds value to our offering, builds customer loyalty and increases willingness to pay. Importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these initiatives as evidenced by our fourth straight quarter of sequential pricing improvement and highest level of reported average yield since 2009. 
Regarding our fleet, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 71% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 74% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. 
Turning to our recycling business. We remain focused on converting to a fee-based model with a more equitable commodity revenue sharing mechanism. This allows us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return on capital deployed while reducing earnings volatility from fluctuating recycled commodity prices. We've advanced this initiative and are making progress. For example, we met with most of our municipal customers whose processing contracts are coming to term in the next 24 months. We are educating them on the economics of recycling and the need to transition to a more durable model. 
To give you some context on why this is achievable, we recently were successful in transitioning one of our largest municipal recycling contracts to a fee-based processing model. This customer values our recycling services and wants to ensure the viability of recycling for their community. Additionally, we remain purposeful when renewing existing contracts or considering new business opportunities. 
In situations where the customer is unwilling to consider more equitable terms, we are simply choosing not to participate. 
It will take time to realize the full impact of our efforts, since most of our recycle business is performed on behalf of municipal customers under multiyear contracts. But we remain committed since recycling is a core component of our business. We believe that improving the profitability of recycling ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. 
Chuck will now discuss the financial results."

Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76  million the prior year. This 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows. Fi",837,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76  million the prior year. This 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield growth of 2.5%. Average yield in the collection business was 3.2%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business and 1.6% yield in the residential business. 
Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.6%. Core price consisted of 4.7% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volume increased 60 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.1%, which includes positive contribution from the industrial business of 2.5% and the residential business of 1%. 
The commercial business was flat with the prior year. Our commercial volume performance includes 40 basis point decline from non-regrettable losses of select National Accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, decreased 1.1%. Landfill decreased 1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 3.3% and C&D at 6.2% offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 6.7%. 
Approximately half of the decline in landfill special waste relates to event-driven jobs and the rest of the decline relates to same-store E&P volumes. It should be noted that we had a very tough comparison in the prior year, since we accepted a record level of special waste in the third quarter of 2014.
Now, fuel recovery fees decreased -- next, fuel recovery fees decreased by 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $35 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.63 in the third quarter from $3.84 in the prior year, a decrease of 31%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs to our fuel recovery fee program.  Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income.
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 15% to an average price of $99 per ton in the third quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton.
Third quarter recycling volume of 673,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 20% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 5%, primarily due to an increase in lower margin compost sales. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat to the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 50 basis points was offset by the impact of recent acquisitions of 30 basis points and lower recycle commodity prices of 20 basis points. 
The 50 basis point expansion in the solid waste business consisted of lower fuel cost of 50 basis points and price in excess of cost inflation of 20 basis points, which was partially offset by a change in business mix of 20 basis points. The change in business mix results from volume growth in our collection business offset by volume declines in our higher-margin landfill business. 
The change in landfill volumes exclusively relates to decline in special waste times. During the quarter, we saw margin expansion in all of our solid waste lines of business with the exception of landfill. Given the fixed cost nature of the landfill business, a decrease in volume generally results in a decline in margin.
When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fee and sale of recycled commodity revenue. For example, the 2.1% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 30 basis points, repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points, and SG&A expense of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Third quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.6% in the third quarter and 38.1% on a year-to-date basis. During the quarter, we recorded an insurance recovery of $50 million or $0.08 of EPS related to our closed Bridgeton Landfill. We removed this benefit from our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter and full year financial guidance. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2016 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. We are currently midway through our annual planning process. And based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following: 
EPS of $2.13 to $2.17, which includes a $0.03 headwind from a noncash increase in our effective tax rate. If you exclude the tax rate headwind, EPS would be projected at $2.16 to $2.20 or 6% to 8% growth from the midpoint of our 2015 EPS guidance. 
Adjusted free cash flow of $790 million to $810 million. This represents 8% to 10% growth over the midpoint of our 2015 free cash flow guidance.  I want to remind you that approximately 30% of our revenue is restricted based on CPI. Given the low CPI and low recycled commodity price environment, we believe our projected earnings and free cash flow growth is strong and reflects the benefits our strategic initiatives are delivering to offset headwinds that are outside of our control. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2016. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. As a result of improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, we expanded solid waste margins by simultaneously growing price and volume; made meaningful progress on structurally changing recycling contracts in the use of alternative indices in our municipal customers; generated earnings and free cash flow growth, keeping us well positioned to achieve our full year 2015 financial guidance; and added $900 million to our existing share repurchase authorization, demonstrating our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders.
As we look forward, we expect this positive momentum to continue into 2016. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, our communities, employees and of course our owners. We remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.

But first, for '15, for the quarter, it was good volume growth. Remember there were a couple of issues in that. One is the year-over-year comp on special waste. Last year, as Chuck said, in Q3 we had a record special waste quarter. So still had a strong quarter in special waste in 2015. And the pipeline is still robust; just had a tough comp there. And also, as we said in the comments, we kind of walked away from some business. It's a non-regrettable loss in around National Accounts and some of our broker portfolio. So that was kind of an upsized event in the quarter of this year. 
So -- and we frankly look at our volumes in C&D and in our large container perm business, the manufacturing business. As we said, as we roll through the year, sequentially we'd see the growth come down just because the comps got tougher. But we still saw plus 2% growth in those lines. And as we've said all along, our growth is heavily dependent on household starts, good special waste flow. Good construction business leads to business formation and more broad recovery. So for 2016 we're expecting positive growth to continue. And of course, when you look at our year-over-year guidance that we did provide or preliminary outlook of pretty strong cash flow growth, you can hopefully see that we expect that trend to continue in '16 for us."

The PBS training we've talked about extensively, really targeting more successfully customers that have more willingness to pay and have more sort of interest in value. That's all happening. We're actually going out with a little more price, because we think the customer base is willing to take it, and we frankly think our service levels have increased through fleet reliability, lowering turnover, improving our customer commitments and so on and so forth. 
So we think all of that's happening from the efforts that we're undertaking as well as, frankly, the market's rational, and there is some positive growth in the market. And even the more irrational, smaller competitors tend to be more rational when there's some positive organic growth. So I think all that together is giving us a better answer in churn.

So Alex, it's probably a little bit too early still unfortunately to give you the cadence. Because again, as you can appreciate, some of this depends on the size of the contracts that are coming to term. It depends on how frequently you were opening contracts in the mid-term of a contract. Many of these changes have happened while the contract is still in place but we're opening contract for other reasons, things like service increase levels and those kind of things. So it's going to depend on that pace. 
It's also going to depend on basically, frankly, the market at large and how broadly it's accepted. I think we've proven that it can happen. And we started this a little over a year ago in earnest. And so we're really happy with the progress. This $200 million is, remember, on that $800 million municipal vertical. And so we're, call it, 1/4 of the way through that. And then we'll be tackling some of the larger contracts that are in that other $1 billion-plus of municipal business.

That's what I wanted to make sure I understood. And then the churn comment I thought was interesting, because am I wrong in thinking that churn has all kinds of interesting knock-on consequences when churn is coming on and whatever -- whether -- what either is driving it down or things that happen as a result of being driven down. So could churn -- one of the biggest more meaningful issues is that you don't have so many missed stops. And missed stops were about the fleet breaking down. And so while we may see R&M up, and everybody is wringing their hands about it, it clearly has introduced a more reliable fleet, which has helped to lower the missed stops and all of those things that happen. Is that right?"

We are a fleet-based operation, right. We're the eighth largest vocational fleet in the nation. Whatever it is, 75% of our revenue comes from our collection business. We make our money with trucks. And very important that we have total fleet reliability. One Fleet's been about that, improving reliability in the fleet, which we think improves employee engagement. It improves driver turnover. It improves service levels. It improves our brand on the street and so on, and so on, and so on. It affects everything we do. So that's why we poured ourselves into One Fleet. It also allows us to, again, methodically extend useful life of the fleet. Again, which now we're second year in a row now we're taking benefit in doing that. Again, very methodically over a 4-, 5-year period, not just flipping a switch, but with a better fleet overall. 
So yes, it runs through the whole organization. So again, churn is the difference in revenue per unit between gained and lost business. That's kind of simple, right. So we're also selling new business at a higher rate than we were last year. So if you signed up with us last year, you would have maybe paid a slightly lower rate per unit and now we're selling more value or you're paying a higher rate per unit. So we watch that as well. 
So we're addressing it fundamentally in the operations through being a better service provider, creating a better customer experience and we're doing it through our sales efforts and all of our tools and then sort of our centralized controls on RPM, et cetera. All those things have got to work together to really drive churn in the right direction. Again, as I said, the fact that the market is rational and there's organic growth, that certainly helps our cause."

So if all my customers are listening and all of my sales organization is listening, the long-term goal is 100%. Because, frankly, again, you can't have a business model that doesn't return your cost of capital, okay. And our recycling business today is improving because we're improving operating costs, because we're shutting facilities. We're actually investing in some facilities where we have good public-private partnerships who were willing to pay for recycling. But we're going to change the model, because we've got this macro thing going on with China. Don't know how long it's going to last, but that's the new norm. We can't live in that norm. We've got to live in a different world. And that's the conversation we had with the large customer that we described. 
So that gives me great hope that we can do it. We certainly have the appetite to do it. And we're not going to have a business that doesn't return its cost of capital and give us good earnings results. On the new indices, it's the same thing. A $0.04 headwind next year, because CPI is going to knock us on our can. So can't live that way. We have about $0.03 of every -- or $0.03 for every $1 of revenue around here goes to pay people, right. We're a people-intensive business. We're a capital-intensive business. And got to replace trucks, containers, got to pay your people well if you want to attract the best people. And those people expect earnings increases. And last I checked health care is not getting cheaper, right. 
So CPI doesn't cut it. And if you're a business owner out there and you're willing to live with 0.5% price increases in your contracts, you're going to be sad by the time you get to the 5th year of your contract. That's what we've been living through. So we've found other ways around it now. We finally said enough is enough last year, and we started to move the index out. And a lot of people said it couldn't be done, the market wouldn't go for it. We now have got 25% of that market vertical converted. And we're not stopping there. It's just a matter of the pace. And again, we're going to make the appropriate returns for our owners in this business. We don't have to haul everybody's garbage. We just have to haul garbage for people that want good quality service for a fair price."

Remember, we're only converting to CNG for our replacement vehicles. So we've got to buy whatever it is, 1,000 trucks a year as the old ones roll off. And we're replacing those, in some cases, with CNG. And so we're not going out and accelerating our fleet purchases just because natural gas is a good deal. So we like -- almost like everything else we do, we sometimes get criticized for kind of taking the slow play on it. But very slow, methodical, logical.

Our third quarter results represent another solid performance by the Republic team. 
We continue to successfully execute our plan, resulting in improved pricing, positive volumes and growth in earnings and free cash flow. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic initiatives while capitalizing on the steady improvement in solid waste trends. Some of our third quarter and year-to-date highlights include: third quarter EPS was $0.53 and year-to-date free cash flow was $603 million. Both performance measures were in line with our expectations. 
Third quarter EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which is consistent with the prior year. Year-to-date EBITDA margin was 28.4%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Core price in the third quarter was 3.6% and average yield was 2.5%. The sequential increase in yield performance reflects an improvement in the level of churn. We define churn as the revenue per unit difference between new and lost business.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. Our collection volumes increased 1.1%, which continues to demonstrate that we can grow price and volume simultaneously. During the quarter, we invested $24 million in tuck-in acquisitions at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.5x.  We remain on track to invest approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions this year.
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $600 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase since the beginning of the year. This includes 7.4 million shares repurchased for $298 million. Our board recently approved a $900 million increase to our existing share repurchase authorization and extended the term through December 2017. 
We continue to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.  Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool. 90% of our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We will be fully rolled out by the end of the year. 
We are seeing very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. Approximately 1.1 million customers have enrolled in our MyResource customer portal and mobile app, significantly enhancing our customer interaction and connectivity. 
And finally, regarding our municipal business, we have over 400 contracts with approximately $200 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for their annual price adjustment.
All of these revenue-enhancing initiatives are designed to improve the customer experience and further differentiate our services from the competition, which adds value to our offering, builds customer loyalty and increases willingness to pay. Importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these initiatives as evidenced by our fourth straight quarter of sequential pricing improvement and highest level of reported average yield since 2009. 
Regarding our fleet, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 71% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 74% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. 
Turning to our recycling business. We remain focused on converting to a fee-based model with a more equitable commodity revenue sharing mechanism. This allows us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return on capital deployed while reducing earnings volatility from fluctuating recycled commodity prices. We've advanced this initiative and are making progress. For example, we met with most of our municipal customers whose processing contracts are coming to term in the next 24 months. We are educating them on the economics of recycling and the need to transition to a more durable model. 
To give you some context on why this is achievable, we recently were successful in transitioning one of our largest municipal recycling contracts to a fee-based processing model. This customer values our recycling services and wants to ensure the viability of recycling for their community. Additionally, we remain purposeful when renewing existing contracts or considering new business opportunities. 
In situations where the customer is unwilling to consider more equitable terms, we are simply choosing not to participate. 
It will take time to realize the full impact of our efforts, since most of our recycle business is performed on behalf of municipal customers under multiyear contracts. But we remain committed since recycling is a core component of our business. We believe that improving the profitability of recycling ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers and the communities we serve. 
Chuck will now discuss the financial results."

Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76  million the prior year. This 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows. Fi",837,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76  million the prior year. This 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield growth of 2.5%. Average yield in the collection business was 3.2%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business and 1.6% yield in the residential business. 
Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.6%. Core price consisted of 4.7% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volume increased 60 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.1%, which includes positive contribution from the industrial business of 2.5% and the residential business of 1%. 
The commercial business was flat with the prior year. Our commercial volume performance includes 40 basis point decline from non-regrettable losses of select National Accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, decreased 1.1%. Landfill decreased 1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 3.3% and C&D at 6.2% offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 6.7%. 
Approximately half of the decline in landfill special waste relates to event-driven jobs and the rest of the decline relates to same-store E&P volumes. It should be noted that we had a very tough comparison in the prior year, since we accepted a record level of special waste in the third quarter of 2014.
Now, fuel recovery fees decreased -- next, fuel recovery fees decreased by 150 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $35 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.63 in the third quarter from $3.84 in the prior year, a decrease of 31%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs to our fuel recovery fee program.  Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income.
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 15% to an average price of $99 per ton in the third quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton.
Third quarter recycling volume of 673,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 20% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 5%, primarily due to an increase in lower margin compost sales. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat to the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 50 basis points was offset by the impact of recent acquisitions of 30 basis points and lower recycle commodity prices of 20 basis points. 
The 50 basis point expansion in the solid waste business consisted of lower fuel cost of 50 basis points and price in excess of cost inflation of 20 basis points, which was partially offset by a change in business mix of 20 basis points. The change in business mix results from volume growth in our collection business offset by volume declines in our higher-margin landfill business. 
The change in landfill volumes exclusively relates to decline in special waste times. During the quarter, we saw margin expansion in all of our solid waste lines of business with the exception of landfill. Given the fixed cost nature of the landfill business, a decrease in volume generally results in a decline in margin.
When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fee and sale of recycled commodity revenue. For example, the 2.1% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 30 basis points, repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points, and SG&A expense of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. 
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Third quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.6% in the third quarter and 38.1% on a year-to-date basis. During the quarter, we recorded an insurance recovery of $50 million or $0.08 of EPS related to our closed Bridgeton Landfill. We removed this benefit from our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter and full year financial guidance. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2016 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. We are currently midway through our annual planning process. And based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following: 
EPS of $2.13 to $2.17, which includes a $0.03 headwind from a noncash increase in our effective tax rate. If you exclude the tax rate headwind, EPS would be projected at $2.16 to $2.20 or 6% to 8% growth from the midpoint of our 2015 EPS guidance. 
Adjusted free cash flow of $790 million to $810 million. This represents 8% to 10% growth over the midpoint of our 2015 free cash flow guidance.  I want to remind you that approximately 30% of our revenue is restricted based on CPI. Given the low CPI and low recycled commodity price environment, we believe our projected earnings and free cash flow growth is strong and reflects the benefits our strategic initiatives are delivering to offset headwinds that are outside of our control. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2016. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. As a result of improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, we expanded solid waste margins by simultaneously growing price and volume; made meaningful progress on structurally changing recycling contracts in the use of alternative indices in our municipal customers; generated earnings and free cash flow growth, keeping us well positioned to achieve our full year 2015 financial guidance; and added $900 million to our existing share repurchase authorization, demonstrating our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders.
As we look forward, we expect this positive momentum to continue into 2016. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, our communities, employees and of course our owners. We remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. 
At this time, operator, we'll open the call for questions."

But first, for '15, for the quarter, it was good volume growth. Remember there were a couple of issues in that. One is the year-over-year comp on special waste. Last year, as Chuck said, in Q3 we had a record special waste quarter. So still had a strong quarter in special waste in 2015. And the pipeline is still robust; just had a tough comp there. And also, as we said in the comments, we kind of walked away from some business. It's a non-regrettable loss in around National Accounts and some of our broker portfolio. So that was kind of an upsized event in the quarter of this year. 
So -- and we frankly look at our volumes in C&D and in our large container perm business, the manufacturing business. As we said, as we roll through the year, sequentially we'd see the growth come down just because the comps got tougher. But we still saw plus 2% growth in those lines. And as we've said all along, our growth is heavily dependent on household starts, good special waste flow. Good construction business leads to business formation and more broad recovery. So for 2016 we're expecting positive growth to continue. And of course, when you look at our year-over-year guidance that we did provide or preliminary outlook of pretty strong cash flow growth, you can hopefully see that we expect that trend to continue in '16 for us."

So Alex, it's probably a little bit too early still unfortunately to give you the cadence. Because again, as you can appreciate, some of this depends on the size of the contracts that are coming to term. It depends on how frequently you were opening contracts in the mid-term of a contract. Many of these changes have happened while the contract is still in place but we're opening contract for other reasons, things like service increase levels and those kind of things. So it's going to depend on that pace. 
It's also going to depend on basically, frankly, the market at large and how broadly it's accepted. I think we've proven that it can happen. And we started this a little over a year ago in earnest. And so we're really happy with the progress. This $200 million is, remember, on that $800 million municipal vertical. And so we're, call it, 1/4 of the way through that. And then we'll be tackling some of the larger contracts that are in that other $1 billion-plus of municipal business. 
And at the same time, of course, we're tackling the recycling fees. So there's a lot of conversation happening with municipal customers, but we think we're making good progress. And we'll just keep informing you as we go and we'll be baking what we think that trend is into our guidance. And we've got it baked into what that preliminary outlook is for '16 currently."

It certainly drives them to produce a better quality volume, right, less contaminant, which is important to the overall value of the material when you sell it. And it just, again, [indiscernible] excess from downside. 
But as I said in my comments, municipalities that really want to recycle, they want real sustainability, they want the durability to the program for their consumer base, for their rate payers, and this is a fair way to do it. So we made a pretty major switch in one of our largest, if not the largest contract we have. And that's a good place to start, and we'll continue to work through the system as we go forward."

We'll continue to use that process that served us pretty well. 
So what we think the pricing picture is for next year is baked into the preliminary outlook we provided. Again, we'll give you much more detail on that in February.

The open market is performing well for us, as I said, pretty rational market overall.  So those are things we need to see.

So could churn -- one of the biggest more meaningful issues is that you don't have so many missed stops. And missed stops were about the fleet breaking down.

We are a fleet-based operation, right. We're the eighth largest vocational fleet in the nation. Whatever it is, 75% of our revenue comes from our collection business. We make our money with trucks. And very important that we have total fleet reliability. One Fleet's been about that, improving reliability in the fleet, which we think improves employee engagement. It improves driver turnover. It improves service levels. It improves our brand on the street and so on, and so on, and so on. It affects everything we do. So that's why we poured ourselves into One Fleet. It also allows us to, again, methodically extend useful life of the fleet. Again, which now we're second year in a row now we're taking benefit in doing that. Again, very methodically over a 4-, 5-year period, not just flipping a switch, but with a better fleet overall. 
So yes, it runs through the whole organization. So again, churn is the difference in revenue per unit between gained and lost business. That's kind of simple, right. So we're also selling new business at a higher rate than we were last year. So if you signed up with us last year, you would have maybe paid a slightly lower rate per unit and now we're selling more value or you're paying a higher rate per unit. So we watch that as well. 
So we're addressing it fundamentally in the operations through being a better service provider, creating a better customer experience and we're doing it through our sales efforts and all of our tools and then sort of our centralized controls on RPM, et cetera. All those things have got to work together to really drive churn in the right direction. Again, as I said, the fact that the market is rational and there's organic growth, that certainly helps our cause."

Because, frankly, again, you can't have a business model that doesn't return your cost of capital, okay. And our recycling business today is improving because we're improving operating costs, because we're shutting facilities. We're actually investing in some facilities where we have good public-private partnerships who were willing to pay for recycling. But we're going to change the model, because we've got this macro thing going on with China. Don't know how long it's going to last, but that's the new norm. We can't live in that norm. We've got to live in a different world. And that's the conversation we had with the large customer that we described. 
So that gives me great hope that we can do it. We certainly have the appetite to do it. And we're not going to have a business that doesn't return its cost of capital and give us good earnings results. On the new indices, it's the same thing. A $0.04 headwind next year, because CPI is going to knock us on our can. So can't live that way. We have about $0.03 of every -- or $0.03 for every $1 of revenue around here goes to pay people, right. We're a people-intensive business. We're a capital-intensive business. And got to replace trucks, containers, got to pay your people well if you want to attract the best people. And those people expect earnings increases. And last I checked health care is not getting cheaper, right. 
So CPI doesn't cut it. And if you're a business owner out there and you're willing to live with 0.5% price increases in your contracts, you're going to be sad by the time you get to the 5th year of your contract. That's what we've been living through. So we've found other ways around it now. We finally said enough is enough last year, and we started to move the index out. And a lot of people said it couldn't be done, the market wouldn't go for it. We now have got 25% of that market vertical converted. And we're not stopping there. It's just a matter of the pace.

We like -- we still think it's a good business through the cycle. We think it's going to come back over time and we're going to be happy with it. We like the assets; we like the people that we have in that business. We'll be selective, but there might be a little bit of that. But then again, that's not going to be the headline, Tony. The tuck-ins in the solid waste business come with very low risk, very high return. Again, as I said, low multiples net of synergy. And our ability to integrate those is very, very quick. So we go from purchase date to, within 120 days, basically collecting the money and seeing the synergy benefits. So it's -- that's where we're going to play."

So you'll see, just like we did in '15, we geared more of our purchase around CNG vehicles to facilities that we already had made the infrastructure investment in, right. So the goal is, once the infrastructure is in place, to convert the entire fleet at that local division to CNG. So we saw less investment in new infrastructure around CNG in '15 than '14. We're still going through that calculation in '16. But we think CNG still is an overall -- still a good investment. 
Remember, we're only converting to CNG for our replacement vehicles. So we've got to buy whatever it is, 1,000 trucks a year as the old ones roll off. And we're replacing those, in some cases, with CNG. And so we're not going out and accelerating our fleet purchases just because natural gas is a good deal. So we like -- almost like everything else we do, we sometimes get criticized for kind of taking the slow play on it. But very slow, methodical, logical. And as the markets shift and move, we think overall that's the right approach. And so we'll -- you'll see more of that in CNG next year. And we've taken the same [indiscernible] with recycling. We never jumped all in with both feet. We just kind of moved forward in the recycling business in a methodical way, so."
