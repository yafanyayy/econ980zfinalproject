Thanks for joining us. So I'd like to start by recognizing our employees from all their hard work this past year. Every day, they demonstrate a consistent focus on performance and a strong commitment to our customers. Thanks t",2395,"Good morning, and thank you. Thanks for joining us. So I'd like to start by recognizing our employees from all their hard work this past year. Every day, they demonstrate a consistent focus on performance and a strong commitment to our customers. Thanks to their collective efforts, we had a solid fourth quarter, underscored by strong earnings per share, cash flow and funded orders. 
Operationally, we continue to execute well on our programs, increase our international and commercial business and create value for shareholders through some disciplined capital allocation and our dividend strategy. Amid persistent challenging conditions, we continue to manage our business effectively, exceeding our 2014 financial plans for orders. Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue our robust cash generation. 
Our net sales for the quarter were $3.2 billion, a 1% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2013. Net sales for the full year were $12.1 billion. Declining U.S. Government sales were partially offset by an increase in net sales to international and commercial customers of 2% to $1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $980 million year-over-year. This increase puts us at 31% international and commercial sales for the quarter, which would be about 28% pro forma, excluding the MSI divestiture, which we expect to close during the second quarter of 2015, and I'll talk about that in more detail in a few minutes. 
We continue to pursue a number of international and commercial opportunities across the company. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 16% year-over-year to $2.36 compared with $2.04. Diluted EPS for the year was $7.56. Funded orders were $3.4 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year. Funded orders for the year were $12.1 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.05x in the quarter, and it was 1 for 2014, reflecting the continued strength of our market positions and exceeding our expectations for 2014. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter declined by 1% or $3 million compared to last year to $303 million. Operating margin decreased by 10 basis points to 9.4% compared to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $452 million, bringing our full year 2014 cash flow to a very robust $946 million. 
While there are clear signs that the U.S. defense industry downturn is approaching the bottom, our strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on providing value through innovative and affordable solutions for all of our customers. An important part of that strategy is continually reshaping our portfolio to reflect our customers' priorities and bring new efficiencies to our core businesses. 
During the fourth quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Marine Systems International or MSI business. The sale of MSI will sharpen our core businesses and also improve our margins on a consolidated basis. Also, our recently completed acquisition of MITEQ reflects a key element of our continuing portfolio-shaping strategy to enhance and augment our business capabilities with niche acquisitions that create long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now some brief comments about the performance of our business segments, including significant awards and milestones starting with Electronic Systems. At Electronic Systems, net sales for the fourth quarter increased by $80 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was up 6% from $145 million to $154 million. Overall, within Electronic Systems, we are well positioned to increase market share across a variety of business areas, and we remain focused on driving margin expansion in the near term. We have excellent performance, and continuous improvement will help us achieve this goal. 
Here are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to receive strong orders for our Wescam sensors from the U.S. Military and key international customers, including the Royal Saudi Air Force, the U.A.E., The People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and AFRICOM. And we continue to make on-time deliveries through our global customer base, including a recent successful delivery to Egypt. 
We are steadily gaining market share in Aviation Products. We received a contract for avionics in support of the U.S. Army's U860 program, where we will be providing standby instrument systems. Also, L-3 entered into a reseller agreement to supply avionics for Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft, which includes component repair and maintenance support. Related to this, we also entered into an agreement for the distribution of L-3 Aviation Products here in the U.S. 
We also received the first purchase order for our new links -- multi-links surveillance system. This single box ADS-B solution is a new product line for the general aviation marketplace, which will be rolled out and marketed in the first quarter of 2015. We recorded a strategic win for specialized directed energy products for the space and missile command and an order for our antisubmarine work vessel system for Indonesia. Under a 5-year program, we were awarded a 9 ship set order for switch gears and circuit breakers for the Virginia class submarine. In our Security & Detection Systems business, we've been selected to provide a new network for radiation detection capability for Dutch Customs. Additionally, in Saudi Arabia, we are providing mobile scanning machines for customs use. 
In Warrior Systems, we saw continued orders for our night vision equipment from both commercial and military customers, including SOCOM. We continued on-time deliveries for shipments through the fourth quarter and received orders for thermal systems from the U.S. Army. And our Link business was selected to provide contract training and simulation services for that E3 program. 
Moving on to Aerospace Systems. Net sales in the segment increased $13 million or about 1% compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating income was up 2% year-over-year. Platform and Logistics Solutions accounted for $8 million of the sales increase, and the remaining $5 million to from ISR Systems. Our performance on legacy programs, especially at ISR Systems, has been outstanding, and this fuels our business along with our ISR and international modernization work. 
Going forward, we see a strong pipeline of opportunities to increase our business space in this area. Key wins in the quarter included a 5-year program for support special mission aircraft operating out of airport base. We were selected to upgrade communication systems on the C32 and C40 aircraft for the DoD and to support a data link upgrade initiative for the C37 aircraft. Internationally, we received continued funding for our work upgrading Argentina's C-130 fleet, and our work on the U.K. Airseeker program continues to proceed very well. We are expecting to deliver our second of 3 aircraft ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Our tactical ISR continues to advance and deliver solid performance metrics. We receive funding for our ISR integration work in Yemen. Our SPYDR platform continues to operate at more than 300 hours per month for its DoD customers, with an overall mission availability rate of 98.8%, and we are meeting our milestones with our Middle East customers. Additionally, we are at work on a new variant of SPYDR to address future Army and SOCOM sensor requirements. We've also been awarded a contract in support of a basic trainer and light lift aircraft initiative in Afghanistan. Performance-wise, we delivered 33 aircraft on time or ahead of schedule to a wide range of customers. 
Communication Systems. Sales in our Communication Systems segment declined by $73 million or about 14% year-over-year. We're working to improve Communication Systems operating performance, building off our unique capabilities and strong market position. Ralph will go through some of the reasons for the decline in little while, but some other highlights in the quarter are: we continue to see strong domestic and international demand for SATCOM. We also have continued orders and funding for SATCOM terminals, including the SDN light program and our Hawkeye equipment as well as an expansion of our work in Australia. We received continued funding for a variety of legacy programs, including orders for ROVER 6 and Vortex for both domestic and international customers, an additional funding for the Gray Eagle program as well as the U2 and F-35 programs. On the global op program, we received a follow-on funding, which also includes a key international opportunity with the Republic of Korea. In addition, we received continued funding for our work on the WIN-T programs as well as orders for a life-cycle upgrade. 
On the Navy side, we saw continued funding for a variety of programs, including the offshore patrol program in Canada and the rigid haul inflatable boat program for the Royal Australian Navy. We are continuing our communications upgrade work on Australia's common class submarines. Our customer reports they are extremely pleased with our progress. From the Australia MOD, we received 2 sets of orders for our traveling-wave tube equipment, and we have continued our work on the Gorgon staff program, which is now a program of record. L-3 Communications work on increments 1 and 2 of this program have been excellent, with 99% mission effectiveness since 2011. We are working with prime on the next-generation hardware for the potential Increment 3 program. 
Moving on to National Security Solutions. Net sales for the fourth quarter at the MSS segment were 15% lower or about $46 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This was mainly due to reduced demand and contract completions as well as the late contract awards for international contracts and protest on U.S. Government contracts where we were the winter. These decreases were partially offset by our acquisition of the Data Tactics business. Despite the challenges in this business area, we are successfully penetrated emerging markets and gaining new customers and market share in the U.S. Government intelligence community. 
The National Security Agency awarded L-3 the Enterprise Program Management contract, or EPM, to provide systems engineering, acquisition planning, program management and financial management, the 2 of NSA's major mission areas. This was our largest contract recompete for 2014. 
We received a major win in the form of a task order to support the U.S. Army's medical communications for combat casualty care program, providing engineering and logistic support. We were selected as 1 of 3 awardees for the U.S. Navy cyber warfare development group vehicle, which is a strategic 3-year program to provide cyberspace support, cryptologic and electronic work operational capabilities. And we recorded our first-ever prime contract win with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency as part of the ITEMS program. We've also receive follow-on funding from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and nuclear test personnel review. This is an 8-year program. 
Now a little bit of capital allocation and acquisitions. Following our long-standing strategy of maximizing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases, we returned $460 million in the fourth quarter compared to $444 million in the fourth quarter of '13. For the year ended December 31, we returned over $1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we purchased $410 million compared to $396 million year-over-year. This brought the total common stock repurchase for the year ended December 31 to $823 million, up from $800 million in the prior year. We will continue to implement our cash allocation strategy, which includes a prudent combination of returning cash to shareholders and common stock repurchases while still investing in the business through R&D, acquisitions, et cetera. 
While our M&A activity was limited in '14, we continue to look closely at opportunities for acquisitions that meet our criteria of adding to market share, enhancing synergies and collaboration across our business segments and delivering new and more innovative solutions to our customers. As part of the strategy, last week, we announced that we have acquired the assets of MITEQ, which will be combined with our micro business. L-3 and MITEQ will employ about 700 people and provide products from U.S. military, government agencies, prime contractors and commercial customers as well. The acquisition is expected to generate approximately $55 million in sales in 2015. This deal adds key RF microwave and low-power SATCOM products and capabilities of creates cross-selling opportunities that will expand our customer base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to shape our portfolio to reflect our customers' priorities and help us achieve operational efficiencies. The sale of our Marine Systems International business is further evidence of this strategy. The MSI transaction is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2015 end. Of course, it's subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. While these transactions are relatively small, they do demonstrate our commitment to finding opportunities to tailor our product mix to our customers' needs and achieve efficiencies that will help us expand. We are committed to finding opportunities to tailor our product mix, the customer needs and achieving efficiencies. 
Regarding the budget. The U.S. Government market remains a challenge in environment with ongoing budget uncertainty, but I do believe we've reached the bottom of the downturn and things will soon begin to grow. What we need our security to prove budget [indiscernible] the geopolitical issues the U.S. is facing. The defense sector contributes to our national security in close partnership with our men and women in uniform, and it's essential that our personnel have equipment readiness to fulfill their duties in this ever-dangerous environment. 
Stopping sequestration has been a difficult process within government. However, with positive signs like the '15 budget authorization and the OCO budget, we remain optimistic that our DoD customer will receive some continued sequester relief for fiscal '16 and beyond. Overall, budget stability will help with our planning process and increase the visibility of our business. We need to continue working with progress to end sequestration and appropriately fund R&D programs that will drive innovation and maintain IR&D investments. At L-3, we are continuing to work the DoD to strategically invest the new technologies that support DoD requirements and priority areas. In this regard, we are also increasing our R&D by about $20 million in 2015. Our focus areas include electronic warfare, sensor development, ISR Systems, space work, cyber and Big Data and the classified arena, which is a growing budget area. Overall, this will help improve our productivity and increase market share in the DoD business. L-3 has a diverse space, including content on nearly every DoD platform. At the same time, we continue to expand our international and commercial business to offset the challenges to our DoD business. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ralph, who'll take us through financial data in more detail."
93538,282078783,751070,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review our 2015 initial guidance.

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review our 2015 initial guidance. Overall, our fourth quarter results generally exceeded our expectations, driven by strong orders, sales, earnings per share and free cash flow and a lower tax rate. Fourth quarter sales of $3.2 billion, only declining 1% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, and that was the high end of our most recent sales guidance range. 
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.36 and benefited from lower tax rate, primarily due to Congress reenacting the research and experimentation or R&E credit in December, which lowered taxes by $22 million and added $0.26 to EPS. Our fourth quarter EPS was also negatively impacted by $80 million charge in Electronic Systems segment-related product specifications matter with the U.S. Government, which subtracted $0.17 from EPS. The R&E credit and the Electronic Systems charge were not assumed or expected in our most recent 2014 guidance. 
At the segment level, fourth quarter sales and margin were ahead of our most recent guidance at Communication Systems and Electronic Systems, excluding the charge for product specifications matter but below our guidance at Aerospace Systems and National Security Solutions. At Electronic Systems on Communication Systems, margins benefited from better sales volumes, cost takeout actions and improved contract performance. Communication Systems also booked and shipped some high-margin SATCOM terminals sooner than we expected. 
Conversely, at aerospace Systems, margin was negatively impacted by additional schedule slips and cost growth on 2 international aircraft modification contracts and reduced pricing and revised incentive fee structure on the new T45 training aircraft support contract, which began on October 1. 
NSS margins were lower due to high-margin international sales sliding to 2015 as well as increased spending on business development and marketing and selling expenses. Lastly, fourth quarter free cash flow was very good, totaling $452 million, resulting in full year free cash flow of almost $950 million, with an earnings to cash flow conversion of 142% and free cash flow per share of $10.77. 
Moving on to this year. Today, we provided our initial guidance for 2015. It is consistent with the preliminary outlook that we provided 3 months ago with some pluses or minuses that offset each other. Our 2015 diluted earnings per share range is $7.35 to $7.65. Included in the EPS guidance is higher pension expense versus 2014 and no Federal R&E tax credit in the tax rate. Pension expense will increase versus 2014 by $59 million, primarily due to a lower discount rate, and that is reducing EPS by $0.45. We expect consolidated sales to decline about 2% to a midpoint of $11,850,000,000 for 2015 versus last year. The Afghanistan drawdown is expected to reduce sales by approximately $250 million year-over-year, and we expect our U.S. Government business, including the DoD, to decline by about 7% and our international commercial business to offset that decline, growing also at about 7%. 
Our recently announced MITEQ acquisition adds about $55 million in sales in 2015. For operating margin, we continue to expect 2015 consolidated margin to be about 9.3% after higher pension expense, which will reduce margin by 50 basis point. Excluding the higher pension expense, we expect margins to increase in every segment with most of the increase in Aerospace Systems and NSS, which had the easier comparisons versus 2014. We had a few offsetting changes in our initial 2015 margin guidance compared to our 2015 preliminary outlook. First, the pension expense increase will be $14 million less than previously estimated, and that's due to a variety of changes and assumptions unrelated to the discount, and that's being offset by higher medical expenses of about $10 million across the company and about $5 million that will further integrate MITEQ with Microwave. The good news with respect to the MITEQ and Lower Microwave integration and consolidation is that beginning in 2016, we expect those combined companies to generate annual operating income synergies of about $5 million, which will increase 2016 operating income year-over-year in com systems by about $10 million when you factor in the $5 million that we incur in 2015 for the integration. Additionally, for 2015, we're increasing our investment in R&D by about $20 million and at U.S. Government classified markets, mostly electronic Systems, and that's to drive future sales growth and that increased investment in R&D is being offset by cost improvements elsewhere in the business and the segments. 
The 2015 tax rate is going to increase because we have no R&E credit. If the R&E credit is reenacted, it will lower the tax rate by about 220 basis points and increase EPS to 2015 by about $0.24. We ultimately expect that there will be an R&E credit for 2015. It's only a matter of when Congress enacts it. 
We expect to generate free cash flow next year -- or this year, rather, of about $925 million and that's -- that'll be cash flow per share of about $11. With respect to the capital allocation, we're still planning for initial share repurchases of $500 million. We ended 2014 with a cash balance of approximately $500 million. That's including $61 million related to MSI, which was classified as an asset held for sale, which will collect when the MSI sale is completed later on this year. So after dividends and share buyback of $500 million, we will have excess cash deploying in 2015 of up to $900 million, including the MSI sales proceeds. And that excludes cash overseas, which will only be about $125 million by the time we get to the end of 2015. 
We expect to have a book-to-bill ratio for the full year of approximately 1.0. With respect to the first quarter outlook, we expect sales to be in the $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion range; margin in the low 8% range; EPS of about $1.50. Free cash flow will be negative in the first quarter by about $100 million, similar to what it was in 2014, and the first quarter book-to-bill ratio looks like it's going to be about 0.95. 
I'd like to make a couple of points about the MSI divestiture. Because it is not reflected in our guidance that we provided today, we'll include us in the guidance when the transaction closes, but I want to let you know what the impact would be ahead of that time. So once it closes, it'll become a discontinued operation, and that will lower income from continuing operations -- or results from continuing operations at the sales line by about $500 million. It'll increase consolidated margin by 10 to 15 basis points and have about a neutral or no impact to our EPS and free cash flow guidance that we gave today for the year. So to conclude my financial review, while the DoD environment will again be challenging for this year, future budget levels are set to improve with the budget likely upturning in FY '16, which begins in October 1. We're effectively managing for the DoD downcycle. The company is resilient and healthy. We're generating robust cash flow, and we'll continue to allocate our capital and our cash flow to increase shareholder value. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

So I did say that we expect our DoD sales to decline by about 7% this year versus 2014. And I recall the base DoD business, which doesn't include the Afghanistan work and the drawdown impacts that we're going to encounter this year. The DoD business is declining about 4%, so it goes from minus 4 to minus 7 because of the $250 million of sales that are going to decline related to draw down from Afghanistan. Traditionally, within that 4% reduction, which is roughly about $300 million at the 4% level, about $100 million of it is due to some legacy DoD platforms ending or being curtailed in terms of fleet size within the platform solutions sector in our Aerospace Systems segment. And I talked about this from the last conference call, and it's a few programs. In particular, it's the U.S. Navy P3 business, which is declining as there were transitions to the new platform, P8. The DoD is planning to reduce the size of the call fleet, probably halving it if the sequester remains in effect, and hopefully, that won't happen but that's something we're seeing in 2015. And then lastly, we still have a little sales fleet to decline in 2015 that come from the decision to retire the JCA fleet a couple of years ago at the beginning of cuts and the DoD downturn. So those are the anomalies there. So if you take away the drawdown and then take away dose legacy programs that are ending, our DoD business is only declining about 2.5% or so year-over-year."

I wouldn't say that's a trend that we're seeing across the businesses where people have stretched too thinly on taking too much risk on some of the programs, but we watch that all the time. We spent a lot of time looking at bids before they go out to make sure that's not occurring. We don't believe that it is. And I think all of these items will be remedied, and our people will learn from them and they won't to be repeated. There you go."

And so we don't expect it to be a continuing problem in terms of adverse impacts to our P&L in the Aerospace Systems sector. And to give you little more detail, about $5 million of the charge pertains to liquidated damages that the contract requirements for being late on schedule, and we're going to try to negotiate some of those damages because there's been some impacts that cause this degradation that don't emanate from the company. So if we can do that, we'll have some opportunity there. And then with respect to T45 program, I think that we adequately calibrated it in our guidance for 2015, so I think we're sufficiently providing for any additional risks on any of those items."

They did an outstanding job of executing and delivering value to customers and shareholders. Our strategy of increasing market share and growing the business internationally and commercially is working. It's yielding key wins and market share gains. Our international and commercial percentage sales went from just 18% to over 30% in just 3 years, and we are well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities that result from portfolio adjustments across the industry. We believe that the bottom of the downturn is within sight and have taken strategic step to take advantage of opportunities that the upturn is certain to bring. Events unfolding around the world show the the strong U.S. commitment is needed, which will continue to drive the demand for L-3's market-leading products in ISR communications, electronics and security. Our strong funded backlog of projects are solid growth prospects. Our agility and innovation continue to differentiate L-3 with the ability to move quickly and to deliver targeted and affordable solutions in the dynamic environment.

I'd like to start by recognizing our employees for all their hard work this past year. Every day, they demonstrate a consistent focus on performance and a strong commitment to our customers. Thanks to their collective efforts. We had a solid fourth quarter underscored by strong earnings per share, cash flow and funded orders. 
Operationally, we continue to execute well on our programs, increase our international and commercial business and create value for shareholders through some disciplined capital allocation and our dividend strategy. Amid persistent challenging conditions, we continue to manage our business effectively, exceeding our 2014 financial plans for orders. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue our robust cash generation. 
Our net sales for the quarter were $3.2 billion, a 1% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2013. Net sales for the full year were $12.1 billion. Declining U.S. government sales were partially offset by an increase in net sales to international and commercial customers of 2% to $1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $980 million year-over-year. This increase puts us at 31% international and commercial sales for the quarter, which would be about 28% pro forma excluding the MSI divestiture, which we expect to close during the second quarter of 2015, and I'll talk about that in more detail in a few minutes. 
We continue to pursue a number of international and commercial opportunities across the company. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 16% year-over-year to $2.36 compared with $2.04. Diluted EPS for the year was $7.56. Funded orders were $3.4 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year. Funded orders for the year were $12.1 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.05x in the quarter and it was 1x for 2014, reflecting the continued strength of our market positions and exceeding our expectations for 2014. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter declined by 1% or $3 million compared to last year to $303 million. Operating margin decreased by 10 basis points to 9.4% compared to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $452 million, bringing our full year 2014 cash flow to a very robust $946 million. 
While there are clear signs that the U.S. defense industry downturn is approaching the bottom, our strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on providing value through innovative and affordable solutions for all of our customers. An important part of that strategy is continually reshaping our portfolio to reflect our customers' priorities and bring new efficiencies to our core businesses. 
During the fourth quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Marine Systems International or MSI business. The sale of MSI will sharpen our focus on our core businesses and also improve our margins on a consolidated basis. 
Also, our recently completed acquisition of MITEQ reflects a key element of our continuing portfolio-shaping strategy to enhance and augment our business capabilities with niche acquisitions that create long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now some brief comments about the performance of our business segments, including significant awards and milestones, starting with Electronic Systems. 
At Electronic Systems, net sales for the fourth quarter increased by $80 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was up 6% from $145 million to $154 million. Overall, within Electronic Systems, we are well positioned to increase market share across a variety of business areas, and we remain focused on driving margin expansion in the near-term. We have excellent performance and continuous improvement will help us achieve this goal. 
Here are some highlights for the quarter. We continued to receive strong orders from our WESCAM -- for our WESCAM sensors from the U.S. Military and key international customers, including the Royal Saudi Air Force, the UAE, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and AFRICOM. And we continue to make on-time deliveries through our global customer base, including a recent successful delivery to Egypt. 
We are steadily gaining market share in Aviation Products. We received a contract for avionics in support of the U.S. Army's UH-60 program, where we will be providing standby instrument systems. Also, L-3 entered into a reseller agreement to supply avionics for Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft, which includes component repair and maintenance support. Related to this, we also entered into an agreement for the distribution of L-3 Aviation Products here in the U.S. 
We also received the first purchase order for our new Lynx MultiLink Surveillance System. This single-box ADS-B solution is a new product line for the general aviation marketplace, which will be rolled out and marketed in the first quarter of 2015. We recorded a strategic win for specialized directed energy products for the phase -- for the Space and Missile Command, and an order for our HELRAS anti-submarine warfare system for Indonesia. Under a 5-year program, we were awarded a 9-ship set order for switchgear and circuit breakers for the Virginia class submarine. 
In our Security & Detection Systems business, we've been selected to provide a new network for radiation detection capability for Dutch Customs. Additionally, in Saudi Arabia, we are providing mobile scanning machines for customs use. 
In Warrior Systems, we saw continued orders for our night vision equipment from both commercial and military customers, including SOCOM. We continued on-time deliveries for shipments through the fourth quarter and received orders for thermal systems from the U.S. Army. 
And our Link business was selected to provide Contract Training and Simulation Services for the E3 program. 
Moving on to Aerospace Systems. Net sales in this segment increased $13 million or about 1% compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating income was up 2% year-over-year. 
Platform & Logistics Solutions accounted for $8 million of the sales increase, and the remaining $5 million came from ISR Systems. Our performance on legacy programs, especially at ISR Systems, has been outstanding, and this fuels our business along with our tactical ISR and international modernization work. 
Going forward, we see a strong pipeline of opportunities to increase our business space in this area. Key wins in the quarter included a 5-year program for support special mission aircraft operating out of Vance Air Force Base. We were selected to upgrade communication systems on the C-32 and C-40 aircraft for the DoD, and to support a data link upgrade initiative for the C-37 aircraft. 
Internationally, we received continued funding for our work upgrading Argentina's C-130 fleet, and our work on the U.K. Air Seeker program continues to proceed very well. We are expecting to deliver our second of 3 aircraft ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Our tactical ISR work continues to advance and deliver solid performance metrics. We received funding for our ISR integration work in Yemen. Our SPYDR platform continues to operate at more than 300 hours per month for its DoD customers, with an overall mission availability rate of 98.8%, and we are meeting our milestones with our Middle East customers. Additionally, we are at work on a new variant of SPYDR to address future Army and SOCOM sensor requirements. We've also been awarded a contract in support of a basic trainer and light lift aircraft initiative in Afghanistan. Performance-wise, we delivered 33 aircraft on time or ahead of schedule to a wide range of customers. 
Communication Systems. Sales in our Communication Systems segment declined by $73 million or about 14% year-over-year. We're working to improve Communication Systems' operating performance, building off our unique capabilities and strong market position. Ralph will go through some of the reasons for the decline in little while, but some other highlights in the quarter are we continue to see strong domestic and international demand for SATCOM. We also had continued orders and funding for SATCOM terminals, including the SDN-Lite program and our Hawkeye equipment, as well as an expansion of our work in Australia. We received continued funding for a variety of legacy programs, including orders for ROVER 6 and VORTEX for both domestic and international customers, an additional funding for the Gray Eagle program, as well as the U-2 and F-35 programs.  
On the global op program, we received follow-on funding, which also includes a key international opportunity with the Republic of Korea. In addition, we received continued funding for our work on the WIN-T program, as well as orders for a life cycle upgrade. 
On the Navy side, we saw continued funding for a variety of programs, including the Offshore Patrol program in Canada and the Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat program for the Royal Australian Navy. We are continuing our communications upgrade work on Australia's Collins Class submarines. Our customer reports they are extremely pleased with our progress.  From the Israeli MoD, we received 2 sets of orders for our Traveling Wave Tube equipment. And we have continued our work on the Gorgon Stare program, which is now a program of record. L-3's communications work on Increments 1 and 2 of this program have been excellent, with 99% mission effectiveness since 2011. We are working with the prime on the next-generation hardware for the potential Increment 3 program. 
Moving on to National Security Solutions. Net sales for the fourth quarter at the NSS segment were 15% lower or about $46 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This was mainly due to reduced demand and contract completions, as well as delayed contract awards for international contracts and protests on U.S. government contracts where we were the winner. These decreases were partially offset by our acquisition of the Data Tactics business. Despite the challenges in this business area, we are successfully penetrating emerging markets and gaining new customers and market share in the U.S. government intelligence community. 
The National Security Agency awarded L-3 the Enterprise Program Management contract, or EPM, to provide systems engineering, acquisition planning, program management and financial management, the 2 of NSA's major mission areas. This was our largest contract recompete for 2014. 
We received a major win in the form of a task order to support the U.S. Army's Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care program, providing engineering and logistic support. We were selected as 1 of 3 awardees for the U.S. Navy Cyber Warfare Development Group vehicle, which is a strategic 3-year program to provide cyberspace support, cryptologic and electronic warfare operational capabilities. And we recorded our first-ever prime contract win with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency as part of the ITEMS program. We have also received follow-on funding from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and Nuclear Test Personnel Review. This is an 8-year program. 
Now a little bit about capital allocation and acquisitions. Following our long-standing strategy of maximizing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases, we returned $460 million in the fourth quarter compared to $444 million in the fourth quarter of '13. For the year ended December 31, we reserved -- we returned over $1 billion.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $410 million compared to $396 million year-over-year. This brought the total common stock repurchase for the year ended December 31 to $823 million, up from $800 million in the prior year. We will continue to implement our cash allocation strategy, which includes a prudent combination of returning cash to shareholders and common stock repurchases, while still investing in the business through R&D, acquisitions, et cetera. 
While our M&A activity was limited in '14, we continue to look closely at opportunities for acquisitions that meet our criteria of adding to market share, enhancing synergies and collaboration across our business segments and delivering new and more innovative solutions to our customers. As part of the strategy, last week, we announced that we have acquired the assets of MITEQ, which will be combined with our Narda Microwave-East business. L-3 Narda-Miteq will employ about 700 people and provide products for the U.S. military, government agencies, prime contractors and commercial customers as well. The acquisition is expected to generate approximately $55 million in sales in 2015. This deal adds key RF microwave and low-power SATCOM products and capabilities and creates cross-selling opportunities that will expand our customer base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to shape our portfolio to reflect our customers' priorities and help us achieve operational efficiencies. The sale of our Marine Systems International business is further evidence of this strategy. The MSI transaction is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2015 end. Of course, it's subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. While these transactions are relatively small, they do demonstrate our commitment to finding opportunities to tailor our product mix to our customers' needs and achieve efficiencies that will help us expand. We are committed to finding opportunities to tailor our product mix, our customer needs and achieving efficiencies. 
Regarding the budget, the U.S. government market remains a challenging environment with ongoing budget uncertainty, but I do believe we have reached the bottom of the downturn and things will soon begin to grow. What we need our security-driven budget that we expect the geopolitical issues the U.S. is facing. The defense sector contributes to our national security in close partnership with our men and women in uniform, and it's essential that our personnel have equipment readiness to fulfill their duties in this ever-dangerous environment. 
Stopping sequestration has been a difficult process within government. However, with positive signs like the '15 budget authorization and the OCO budget, we remain optimistic that our DoD customer will receive some continued sequester relief for fiscal '16 and beyond. 
Overall, budget stability and growth will help with our planning process and increase the visibility of our business. We need to continue working with Congress to end sequestration and appropriately fund the R&D programs that will drive innovation and maintain IR&D investments. 
For L-3, we are continuing to work with the DoD to strategically invest the new technologies that support DoD requirements and priority areas. In this regard, we are also increasing our R&D by about $20 million in 2015. Our focus areas include electronic warfare, sensor development, ISR Systems, space work, cyber and Big Data and the classified arena, which is a growing budget area. 
Overall, this will help improve our productivity and increase market share in the DoD business. L-3 has a diverse base, including content on nearly every DoD platform. At the same time, we continue to expand our international and commercial business to offset the challenges to our DoD business. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ralph, who'll take us through financial data in more detail."
93538,282078783,751506,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review our 2015 initial guidance.

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review our 2015 initial guidance. Overall, our fourth quarter results generally exceeded our expectations, driven by strong orders, sales, earnings per share and free cash flow and a lower tax rate. 
Fourth quarter sales were $3.2 billion, only declining 1% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, and that was the high end of our most recent sales guidance range. 
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.36 and it benefited from a lower tax rate, primarily due to Congress reenacting the Research and Experimentation or R&E credit in December, which lowered taxes by $22 million and added $0.26 to EPS. Our fourth quarter EPS was also negatively impacted by an $18 million charge in Electronic Systems segment related to a product specifications matter with the U.S. government, which subtracted $0.17 from EPS. The R&E credit and the Electronic Systems charge were not assumed or expected in our most recent 2014 guidance. 
At the segment level, fourth quarter sales and margin were ahead of our most recent guidance at Communication Systems and Electronic Systems, excluding that charge for that product specifications matter, but below our guidance at Aerospace Systems and National Security Solutions. 
At Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, margins benefited from better sales volume, cost takeout actions, improved contract -- and improved contract performance. Communication Systems also booked and shipped some high-margin SATCOM terminals sooner than we had expected. 
Conversely, at Aerospace Systems, margin was negatively impacted by additional schedule slips and cost growth on 2 international aircraft modification contracts and reduced pricing and a revised incentive fee structure on the new T-45 training aircraft support contract, which began on October 1. 
NSS margins were lower due to high-margin international sales sliding to 2015, as well as increased spending on business development and marketing and selling expenses. 
Lastly, fourth quarter free cash flow was very good, totaling $452 million, resulting in full year free cash flow of almost $950 million, with an earnings to cash flow conversion of 142% and free cash flow per share of $10.77. 
Moving on to this year. Today, we provided our initial guidance for 2015. It is consistent with the preliminary outlook that we provided 3 months ago, with some pluses and minuses that offset each other. 
Our 2015 diluted earnings per share range is $7.35 to $7.65. Included in the EPS guidance is higher pension expense versus 2014 and no federal R&E tax credit in the tax rate. Pension expense will increase versus 2014 by $59 million, primarily due to a lower discount rate, and that is reducing EPS by $0.45. We expect consolidated sales to decline about 2% to a midpoint of $11,850,000,000 for 2015 versus last year. The Afghanistan drawdown is expected to reduce sales by approximately $250 million year-over-year, and we expect our U.S. government business, including the DoD, to decline by about 7% and our international and commercial business to offset that decline, growing also at about 7%. 
Our recently announced MITEQ acquisition adds about $55 million to sales in 2015. For operating margin, we continue to expect 2015 consolidated margin to be about 9.3% after higher pension expense, which will reduce margin by 50 basis points. Excluding the higher pension expense, we expect margins to increase in every segment, with most of the increase in Aerospace Systems and NSS, which had the easier comparisons versus 2014. 
We have a few offsetting changes in our initial 2015 margin guidance compared to our 2015 preliminary outlook. First, the pension expense increase will be $14 million less than previously estimated, and that's due to a variety of changes and assumptions unrelated to the discount, and that's being offset by higher medical expenses of about $10 million across the company and about $5 million that we'll incur to integrate MITEQ with Narda Microwave. 
The good news with respect to the MITEQ and Narda Microwave integration and consolidation is that beginning in 2016, we expect those combined companies to generate annual operating income synergies of about $5 million, which will increase 2016 operating income year-over-year in Comm Systems by about $10 million when you factor in the $5 million that we'll incur in 2015 for the integration. 
Additionally, for 2015, we're increasing our investment in R&D by about $20 million aimed at U.S. government classified markets, mostly in Electronic Systems, and that's to drive future sales growth, and that increased investment in R&D is being offset by cost improvements elsewhere in the business and the segments. 
The 2015 tax rate is going to increase because we have no R&E credit. If the R&E credit is reenacted, it will lower the tax rate by about 220 basis points and increase EPS for 2015 by about $0.24. We ultimately expect that there will be an R&E credit for 2015. It's only a matter of when Congress enacts it. 
We expect to generate free cash flow next year -- or this year, rather, of about $925 million and that's going -- that will be cash flow per share of about $11. 
With respect to the capital allocation, we're still planning for initial share repurchases of $500 million. We ended 2014 with a cash balance of approximately $500 million, that's including $61 million related to MSI, which is classified as an asset held for sale, which we'll collect when the MSI sale is completed later on this year. 
So after dividends and the share buyback of $500 million, we will have excess cash to deploy in 2015 of up to $900 million, including the MI -- MSI sales proceeds. And that excludes cash overseas, which will only be about $125 million by the time we get to the end of 2015. 
We expect to have a book-to-bill ratio for the full year of approximately 1.0x. With respect to the first quarter outlook, we expect sales to be in the $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion range, margin in the low 8% range, EPS of about $1.50. Free cash flow will be negative in the first quarter by about $100 million, similar to what it was in 2014. And the first quarter book-to-bill ratio looks like it's going to be about 0.95x. 
I'd like to make a couple of points about the MSI divestiture. Because it is not reflected in our guidance that we provided today, we'll include that in the guidance when the transaction closes, but I want to let you know what the impact would be ahead of that time. So once it closes, it'll become a discontinued operation, and that will lower income from continuing operations -- or results from continuing operations at the sales line by about $500 million. It'll increase consolidated margin by 10 to 15 basis points, and have about a neutral or no impact to our EPS and free cash flow guidance that we gave today for the year. 
So to conclude my financial review, while the DoD environment will, again, be challenging for this year, future budget levels are set to improve, with the budget likely upturning in FY '16, which begins in October 1. We're effectively managing for the DoD downcycle. The company is resilient and healthy. We're generating robust cash flow. And we'll continue to allocate our capital and our cash flow to increase shareholder value. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

So I did say that we expect our DoD sales to decline by about 7% this year versus 2014. And when I recall the base DoD business, which doesn't include the Afghanistan work and the drawdown impacts that we're going to encounter this year, the DoD business is declining about 4%, so it goes from minus 4 to minus 7 because of the $250 million of sales that are going to decline related to draw down from Afghanistan. 
Traditionally, within that 4% reduction, which is roughly about $300 million at the 4% level, about $100 million of it is due to some legacy DoD platforms ending or being curtailed in terms of fleet size within the Platform Solutions sector in our Aerospace Systems segment. And I talked about this from the last conference call, and it's a few programs in particular. It's the U.S. Navy P-3 modification business, which is declining as that work transitions to the new platform, P-8. The DoD is planning to reduce the size of the Compass Call fleet, probably halving it if sequester remains in effect and, hopefully, that won't happen, but that's something we're seeing in 2015. 
And then lastly, we're still have a little sales leakage or decline in 2015 that comes from the decision to retire the JCA fleet a couple of years ago at the beginning of all these budget cuts and the DoD downturn. 
So those are the anomalies there. So if you take away the drawdown, and then take away those legacy programs that are ending, our DoD business is only declining about 2.5% or so year-over-year."

And to give you little more detail, about $5 million of the charge pertains to liquidated damages that the contract provides for being late on schedule, and we are going to try to negotiate away some of those damages because there's been some impacts that have caused this degradation that don't emanate from the company. So if we can do that, we'll have some opportunity there.

They've done an outstanding job of executing and delivering value to customers and shareholders. 
Our strategy of increasing market share and growing the business internationally and commercially is working. It's yielding key wins and market share gains. Our international and commercial percentage of sales went from just 18% to over 30% in just 3 years. And we're all well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities that result from portfolio adjustments across the industry. 
We believe that the bottom of the downturn is within sight and have taken strategic steps to take advantage of opportunities that the upturn is certain to bring. 
Events unfolding around the world show the a strong U.S. commitment is needed, which will continue to drive the demand for L-3's market-leading products in ISR, Communications, Electronics and Security. Our strong funded backlog of projects are solid growth prospects. Our agility and innovation continue to differentiate L-3 with the ability to move quickly and to deliver targeted and affordable solutions in the dynamic environment.

I'd like to start by recognizing our employees for all their hard work this past year. Every day, they demonstrate a consistent focus on performance and a strong commitment to our customers. Thanks to their collective efforts. We had a solid fourth quarter underscored by strong earnings per share, cash flow and funded orders. 
Operationally, we continue to execute well on our programs, increase our international and commercial business and create value for shareholders through some disciplined capital allocation and our dividend strategy. Amid persistent challenging conditions, we continue to manage our business effectively, exceeding our 2014 financial plan for orders. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue our robust cash generation. 
Our net sales for the quarter were $3.2 billion, a 1% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2013. Net sales for the full year were $12.1 billion. Declining U.S. government sales were partially offset by an increase in net sales to international and commercial customers of 2% to $1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $980 million year-over-year. This increase puts us at 31% international and commercial sales for the quarter, which would be about 28% pro forma excluding the MSI divestiture, which we expect to close during the second quarter of 2015, and I'll talk about that in more detail in a few minutes. 
We continue to pursue a number of international and commercial opportunities across the company. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 16% year-over-year to $2.36 compared with $2.04. Diluted EPS for the year was $7.56. Funded orders were $3.4 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year. Funded orders for the year were $12.1 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.05x in the quarter and it was 1x for 2014, reflecting the continued strength of our market positions and exceeding our expectations for 2014. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter declined by 1% or $3 million compared to last year to $303 million. Operating margin decreased by 10 basis points to 9.4% compared to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $452 million, bringing our full year 2014 cash flow to a very robust $946 million. 
While there are clear signs that the U.S. defense industry downturn is approaching the bottom, our strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on providing value through innovative and affordable solutions for all of our customers. An important part of that strategy is continually reshaping our portfolio to reflect our customers' priorities and bring new efficiencies to our core businesses. 
During the fourth quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Marine Systems International or MSI business. The sale of MSI will sharpen our focus on our core businesses and also improve our margins on a consolidated basis. 
Also, our recently completed acquisition of MITEQ reflects a key element of our continuing portfolio-shaping strategy to enhance and augment our business capabilities with niche acquisitions that create long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now some brief comments about the performance of our business segments, including significant awards and milestones, starting with Electronic Systems. 
At Electronic Systems, net sales for the fourth quarter increased by $80 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was up 6% from $145 million to $154 million. Overall, within Electronic Systems, we are well positioned to increase market share across a variety of business areas, and we remain focused on driving margin expansion in the near-term. We have excellent performance and continuous improvement will help us achieve this goal. 
Here are some highlights for the quarter. We continued to receive strong orders from our WESCAM -- for our WESCAM sensors from the U.S. Military and key international customers, including the Royal Saudi Air Force, the UAE, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and AFRICOM. And we continue to make on-time deliveries through our global customer base, including a recent successful delivery to Egypt. 
We are steadily gaining market share in aviation products. We received a contract for avionics in support of the U.S. Army's UH-60 program, where we will be providing standby instrument systems. Also, L-3 entered into a reseller agreement to supply avionics for Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft, which includes component repair and maintenance support. Related to this, we also entered into an agreement for the distribution of L-3 Aviation Products here in the U.S. 
We also received the first purchase order for our new Lynx MultiLink Surveillance System. This single-box ADS-B solution is a new product line for the general aviation marketplace, which will be rolled out and marketed in the first quarter of 2015. We recorded a strategic win for specialized directed energy products for the phase -- for the Space and Missile Command, and an order for our HELRAS anti-submarine warfare system for Indonesia. Under a 5-year program, we were awarded a 9 chip set order for switchgear and circuit breakers for the Virginia class submarine. 
In our Security & Detection Systems business, we've been selected to provide a new network for radiation detection capability for Dutch Customs. Additionally, in Saudi Arabia, we are providing mobile scanning machines for customs use. 
In Warrior Systems, we saw continued orders for our night vision equipment from both commercial and military customers, including SOCOM. We continued on-time deliveries for shipments through the fourth quarter and received orders for thermal systems from the U.S. Army. 
And our Link business was selected to provide Contract Training and Simulation Services for the E3 program. 
Moving on to Aerospace Systems. Net sales in this segment increased $13 million or about 1% compared to the 2013 fourth quarter. Operating income was up 2% year-over-year. 
Platform & Logistics Solutions accounted for $8 million of the sales increase, and the remaining $5 million came from ISR Systems. Our performance on legacy programs, especially at ISR Systems, has been outstanding, and this fuels our business along with our tactical ISR and international modernization work. 
Going forward, we see a strong pipeline of opportunities to increase our business space in this area. Key wins in the quarter included a 5-year program for support special mission aircraft operating out of Vance Air Force Base. We were selected to upgrade communication systems on the C-32 and C-40 aircraft for the DoD, and to support a data link upgrade initiative for the C-37 aircraft. 
Internationally, we received continued funding for our work upgrading Argentina's C-130 fleet, and our work on the U.K. Air Seeker program continues to proceed very well. We are expecting to deliver our second of 3 aircraft ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Our tactical ISR work continues to advance and deliver solid performance metrics. We received funding for our ISR integration work in Yemen. Our SPYDR platform continues to operate at more than 300 hours per month for its DoD customers, with an overall mission availability rate of 98.8%, and we are meeting our milestones with our Middle East customers. Additionally, we are at work on a new variant of SPYDR to address future Army and SOCOM sensor requirements. We've also been awarded a contract in support of a basic trainer and light lift aircraft initiative in Afghanistan. Performance-wise, we delivered 33 aircraft on time or ahead of schedule to a wide range of customers. 
Communication Systems. Sales in our Communication Systems segment declined by $73 million or about 14% year-over-year. We're working to improve Communication Systems' operating performance, building off our unique capabilities and strong market position. Ralph will go through some of the reasons for the decline in little while, but some other highlights in the quarter are we continue to see strong domestic and international demand for SATCOM. We also had continued orders and funding for SATCOM terminals, including the SDN-Lite program and our Hawkeye equipment, as well as an expansion of our work in Australia. We received continued funding for a variety of legacy programs, including orders for ROVER 6 and VORTEX for both domestic and international customers and additional funding for the Gray Eagle program, as well as the U-2 and F-35 programs.  
On the global op program, we received follow-on funding, which also includes a key international opportunity with the Republic of Korea. In addition, we received continued funding for our work on the WIN-T program, as well as orders for a life cycle upgrade. 
On the Navy side, we saw continued funding for a variety of programs, including the Offshore Patrol program in Canada and the Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat program for the Royal Australian Navy. We are continuing our communications upgrade work on Australia's Collins Class submarines. Our customer reports they are extremely pleased with our progress.  From the Israeli MoD, we received 2 sets of orders for our Traveling Wave Tube equipment. And we have continued our work on the Gorgon Stare program, which is now a program of record. L-3's communications work on Increments 1 and 2 of this program have been excellent, with 99% mission effectiveness since 2011. We are working with the prime on the next-generation hardware for the potential Increment 3 program. 
Moving on to National Security Solutions. Net sales for the fourth quarter at the NSS segment were 15% lower or about $46 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This was mainly due to reduced demand and contract completions, as well as delayed contract awards for international contracts and protests on U.S. government contracts where we were the winner. These decreases were partially offset by our acquisition of the Data Tactics business. Despite the challenges in this business area, we are successfully penetrating emerging markets and gaining new customers and market share in the U.S. government intelligence community. 
The National Security Agency awarded L-3 the Enterprise Program Management contract, or EPM, to provide systems engineering, acquisition planning, program management and financial management, the 2 of NSA's major mission areas. This was our largest contract recompete for 2014. 
We received a major win in the form of a task order to support the U.S. Army's Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care program, providing engineering and logistic support. We were selected as 1 of 3 awardees for the U.S. Navy Cyber Warfare Development Group vehicle, which is a strategic 3-year program to provide cyberspace support, cryptologic and electronic warfare operational capabilities. And we recorded our first-ever prime contract win with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency as part of the ITEMS program. We have also received follow-on funding from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and Nuclear Test Personnel Review. This is an 8-year program. 
Now a little bit about capital allocation and acquisitions. Following our long-standing strategy of maximizing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases, we returned $460 million in the fourth quarter compared to $444 million in the fourth quarter of '13. For the year ended December 31, we reserved -- we returned over $1 billion.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $410 million compared to $396 million year-over-year. This brought the total common stock repurchase for the year ended December 31 to $823 million, up from $800 million in the prior year. We will continue to implement our cash allocation strategy, which includes a prudent combination of returning cash to shareholders and common stock repurchases, while still investing in the business through R&D, acquisitions, et cetera. 
While our M&A activity was limited in '14, we continue to look closely at opportunities for acquisitions that meet our criteria of adding to market share, enhancing synergies and collaboration across our business segments and delivering new and more innovative solutions to our customers. As part of the strategy, last week, we announced that we have acquired the assets of MITEQ, which will be combined with our Narda Microwave-East business. L-3 Narda-Miteq will employ about 700 people and provide products for the U.S. military, government agencies, prime contractors and commercial customers as well. The acquisition is expected to generate approximately $55 million in sales in 2015. This deal adds key RF microwave and low-power SATCOM products and capabilities and creates cross-selling opportunities that will expand our customer base. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to shape our portfolio to reflect our customers' priorities and help us achieve operational efficiencies. The sale of our Marine Systems International business is further evidence of this strategy. The MSI transaction is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2015 end. Of course, it's subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. While these transactions are relatively small, they do demonstrate our commitment to finding opportunities to tailor our product mix to our customers' needs and achieve efficiencies that will help us expand. We are committed to finding opportunities to tailor our product mix, our customer needs and achieving efficiencies. 
Regarding the budget, the U.S. government market remains a challenging environment with ongoing budget uncertainty, but I do believe we have reached the bottom of the downturn and things will soon begin to grow. What we need are security-driven budgets that we expect the geopolitical issues the U.S. is facing. The defense sector contributes to our national security in close partnership with our men and women in uniform, and it's essential that our personnel have equipment readiness to fulfill their duties in this ever-dangerous environment. 
Stopping sequestration has been a difficult process within government. However, with positive signs like the '15 budget authorization and the OCO budget, we remain optimistic that our DoD customer will receive some continued sequester relief for fiscal '16 and beyond. 
Overall, budget stability and growth will help with our planning process and increase the visibility of our business. We need to continue working with Congress to end sequestration and appropriately fund the R&D programs that will drive innovation and maintain IR&D investments. 
For L-3, we are continuing to work with the DoD to strategically invest the new technologies that support DoD requirements and priority areas. In this regard, we are also increasing our R&D by about $20 million in 2015. Our focus areas include electronic warfare, sensor development, ISR Systems, space work, cyber and Big Data and the classified arena, which is a growing budget area. 
Overall, this will help improve our productivity and increase market share in the DoD business. L-3 has a diverse base, including content on nearly every DoD platform. At the same time, we continue to expand our international and commercial business to offset the challenges to our DoD business. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ralph, who'll take us through financial data in more detail."
93538,282078783,751762,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review our 2015 initial guidance.

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review our 2015 initial guidance. Overall, our fourth quarter results generally exceeded our expectations, driven by strong orders, sales, earnings per share and free cash flow and a lower tax rate. 
Fourth quarter sales were $3.2 billion, only declining 1% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, and that was the high end of our most recent sales guidance range. 
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.36 and it benefited from a lower tax rate, primarily due to Congress reenacting the Research and Experimentation or R&E credit in December, which lowered taxes by $22 million and added $0.26 to EPS. Our fourth quarter EPS was also negatively impacted by an $18 million charge in Electronic Systems segment related to a product specifications matter with the U.S. government, which subtracted $0.17 from EPS. The R&E credit and the Electronic Systems charge were not assumed or expected in our most recent 2014 guidance. 
At the segment level, fourth quarter sales and margin were ahead of our most recent guidance at Communication Systems and Electronic Systems, excluding that charge for that product specifications matter, but below our guidance at Aerospace Systems and National Security Solutions. 
At Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, margins benefited from better sales volume, cost takeout actions, improved contract -- and improved contract performance. Communication Systems also booked and shipped some high-margin SATCOM terminals sooner than we had expected. 
Conversely, at Aerospace Systems, margin was negatively impacted by additional schedule slips and cost growth on 2 international aircraft modification contracts and reduced pricing and a revised incentive fee structure on the new T-45 training aircraft support contract, which began on October 1. 
NSS margins were lower due to high-margin international sales sliding to 2015, as well as increased spending on business development and marketing and selling expenses. 
Lastly, fourth quarter free cash flow was very good, totaling $452 million, resulting in full year free cash flow of almost $950 million, with an earnings to cash flow conversion of 142% and free cash flow per share of $10.77. 
Moving on to this year. Today, we provided our initial guidance for 2015. It is consistent with the preliminary outlook that we provided 3 months ago, with some pluses and minuses that offset each other. 
Our 2015 diluted earnings per share range is $7.35 to $7.65. Included in the EPS guidance is higher pension expense versus 2014 and no federal R&E tax credit in the tax rate. Pension expense will increase versus 2014 by $59 million, primarily due to a lower discount rate, and that is reducing EPS by $0.45. We expect consolidated sales to decline about 2% to a midpoint of $11,850,000,000 for 2015 versus last year. The Afghanistan drawdown is expected to reduce sales by approximately $250 million year-over-year, and we expect our U.S. government business, including the DoD, to decline by about 7% and our international and commercial business to offset that decline, growing also at about 7%. 
Our recently announced MITEQ acquisition adds about $55 million to sales in 2015. For operating margin, we continue to expect 2015 consolidated margin to be about 9.3% after higher pension expense, which will reduce margin by 50 basis points. Excluding the higher pension expense, we expect margins to increase in every segment, with most of the increase in Aerospace Systems and NSS, which had the easier comparisons versus 2014. 
We have a few offsetting changes in our initial 2015 margin guidance compared to our 2015 preliminary outlook. First, the pension expense increase will be $14 million less than we previously estimated, and that's due to a variety of changes and assumptions unrelated to the discount, and that's being offset by higher medical expenses of about $10 million across the company and about $5 million that we'll incur to integrate MITEQ with Narda Microwave. 
The good news with respect to the MITEQ and Narda Microwave integration and consolidation is that beginning in 2016, we expect those combined companies to generate annual operating income synergies of about $5 million, which will increase 2016 operating income year-over-year in Comm Systems by about $10 million when you factor in the $5 million that we'll incur in 2015 for the integration. 
Additionally, for 2015, we're increasing our investment in R&D by about $20 million aimed at U.S. government classified markets, mostly in Electronic Systems, and that's to drive future sales growth, and that increased investment in R&D is being offset by cost improvements elsewhere in the business and the segments. 
The 2015 tax rate is going to increase because we have no R&E credit. If the R&E credit is reenacted, it will lower the tax rate by about 220 basis points and increase EPS for 2015 by about $0.24. We ultimately expect that there will be an R&E credit for 2015. It's only a matter of when Congress enacts it. 
We expect to generate free cash flow next year -- or this year, rather, of about $925 million and that's going -- that will be cash flow per share of about $11. 
With respect to the capital allocation, we're still planning for initial share repurchases of $500 million. We ended 2014 with a cash balance of approximately $500 million, that's including $61 million related to MSI, which is classified as an asset held for sale, which we'll collect when the MSI sale is completed later on this year. 
So after dividends and the share buyback of $500 million, we will have excess cash to deploy in 2015 of up to $900 million, including the MI -- MSI sales proceeds. And that excludes cash overseas, which will only be about $125 million by the time we get to the end of 2015. 
We expect to have a book-to-bill ratio for the full year of approximately 1.0x. With respect to the first quarter outlook, we expect sales to be in the $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion range, margin in the low 8% range, EPS of about $1.50. Free cash flow will be negative in the first quarter by about $100 million, similar to what it was in 2014. And the first quarter book-to-bill ratio looks like it's going to be about 0.95x. 
I'd like to make a couple of points about the MSI divestiture because it is not reflected in our guidance that we provided today. We'll include that in the guidance when the transaction closes, but I want to let you know what the impact would be ahead of that time. So once it closes, it'll become a discontinued operation, and that will lower income from continuing operations -- or results from continuing operations at the sales line by about $500 million. It'll increase consolidated margin by 10 to 15 basis points, and have about a neutral or no impact to our EPS and free cash flow guidance that we gave today for the year. 
So to conclude my financial review, while the DoD environment will, again, be challenging for this year, future budget levels are set to improve, with the budget likely upturning in FY '16, which begins in October 1. We're effectively managing for the DoD downcycle. The company is resilient and healthy. We're generating robust cash flow. And we'll continue to allocate our capital and our cash flow to increase shareholder value. 
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

So I did say that we expect our DoD sales to decline by about 7% this year versus 2014. And when I recall the base DoD business, which doesn't include the Afghanistan work and the drawdown impacts that we're going to encounter this year, the DoD business is declining about 4%, so it goes from minus 4 to minus 7 because of the $250 million of sales that are going to decline related to draw down from Afghanistan. 
Traditionally, within that 4% reduction, which is roughly about $300 million at the 4% level, about $100 million of it is due to some legacy DoD platforms ending or being curtailed in terms of fleet size within the Platform Solutions sector in our Aerospace Systems segment. And I talked about this from the last conference call, and it's a few programs in particular. It's the U.S. Navy P-3 modification business, which is declining as that work transitions to the new platform, P-8. The DoD is planning to reduce the size of the Compass Call fleet, probably halving it if sequester remains in effect and, hopefully, that won't happen, but that's something we're seeing in 2015. 
And then lastly, we're still have a little sales leakage or decline in 2015 that comes from the decision to retire the JCA fleet a couple of years ago at the beginning of all these budget cuts and the DoD downturn. 
So those are the anomalies there. So if you take away the drawdown, and then take away those legacy programs that are ending, our DoD business is only declining about 2.5% or so year-over-year."

And to give you little more detail, about $5 million of the charge pertains to liquidated damages that the contract provides for being late on schedule, and we are going to try to negotiate away some of those damages because there's been some impacts that have caused this degradation that don't emanate from the company. So if we can do that, we'll have some opportunity there.

Our strategy of increasing market share and growing the business internationally and commercially is working. It's yielding key wins and market share gains.

And we're all well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities that result from portfolio adjustments across the industry. 
We believe that the bottom of the downturn is within sight and have taken strategic steps to take advantage of opportunities that the upturn is certain to bring. 
Events unfolding around the world show the a strong U.S. commitment is needed, which will continue to drive the demand for L-3's market-leading products in ISR, Communications, Electronics and Security. Our strong funded backlog of projects are solid growth prospects. Our agility and innovation continue to differentiate L-3 with the ability to move quickly and to deliver targeted and affordable solutions in the dynamic environment.

Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 for the quarter reinforces our growth strategy and outlook for the full year, where we expect our 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0. We continue to execute and deliver operational performance on the majority of our programs. However, we experienced additional cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts due to supplier issues, causing schedule slips and substantial rework. We also had continued delayed contract awards in our NSS segment, both of which impacted our first quarter performance. We have recently integrated our Platform Systems business into our ISR Systems sector to strengthen management and enhance multiple skill sets to improve program performance at Platform Systems. 
There are a number of key competitive wins that would not be possible without the efforts of our employees and our management team, and as always I thank them for their consistent hard work, especially in focusing on our strategy of expanding our international and commercial footprint. The fundamental growth drivers of our business remained strong during the first quarter. We had net sales of $2.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of just over 8% compared with the 2014 first quarter. Net sales to international and commercial customers as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased slightly from 29% to 30% year-over-year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.43, down from $1.90 in the first quarter of 2014. This excludes on $0.18 charge related to the sale of our Marine Systems International business.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $87 million. This is an improvement over the first quarter of '14, when we used $62 million in net cash.
Funded orders for the quarter were $2.9 billion, a 4% decrease year-over-year. Funded backlog increased about 1% to $10.3 billion compared to $10.2 billion at year-end 2014.
Investment in our business remains a priority, and we have increased our focus on technology and investment and we'll continue this with the expectation that IRAD will constitute close to 2.5% of 2015 revenues.
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers. Across L-3's business, we continue to focus on payloads, not platforms, as an approach, to upgrade and enhance our customer offerings and to provide the best technology available. This keeps us well aligned with DoD initiatives like better buying power 3.0.
Several of our key wins in the quarter, including our photonics mast work, our Virginia class submarines and our advanced display selected for the U.S. Army's Black Hawk helicopters are examples of this approach.
In keeping with our strategy, we are taking the appropriate actions to enhance our ability to anticipate and effectively address customer priorities and to promote growth. As we remain focused on our core businesses, we continuously bolster our profitability through better integration and collaboration across the company to both reduce costs as well as increased productivity.
The integration of Narda and the recently acquired Miteq business into our Communication Systems business is proceeding on pace and is a good addition to that segment. And the sale of our Marine Systems International business has received the necessary regulatory approvals and is now on track to be completed in the second quarter.
We recently sold our broadcast sports business to a private equity firm, though small, this disposition is consistent with our strategy to continuously evaluate our portfolio and divest non-core businesses to strengthen our core businesses and better position us to capture growth opportunities. These divestitures demonstrate our focus on building our core business, improving margins and enhancing our future growth profile. And each of these transactions is evidence of our disciplined business portfolio strategy.
On the acquisition front, overall M&A activity levels in our markets are increasing. We fully expect to continue to add to our portfolio with a view towards expanding our business space and delivering value that addresses our customer priorities. We are attuned to the industry and market conditions. We have a proven strategy in place with a focus on increasing market share and staying agile to take advantage of growth opportunities.
Now I'll make some brief comments on our business segment performance and touch on significant awards and milestones.
First off, in Electronic Systems, which is our largest segment, we continue to seek out new opportunities to gain market share. We've been focused on increasing margins in this area as well. Nearly 1/2 of this business is international and commercial and it's growing. We received ongoing orders and funding in the quarter for a wide range of projects, including the ship to shore connect, Hercules engines and our security and detection systems products. This includes an order for our pro vision II screening systems for the TSA.
continues to increase its customer base with an award to provide Boeing 787  training devices to Virgin Atlantic Airways. We were recently awarded a contract for our unique photonic mast. This is a significant win for L-3 and provides the U.S. Navy with new stuff technology for submarines.
In support of the Navyship modernization program, we were selected to provide a variety of services aimed at increasing readiness and reducing maintenance and workload requirements. This also positions L-3 for a range of similar international pursuits.
We were awarded contract by U.S. SOCOM for binocular night vision devices, and we are seeing ongoing strong orders for our EN BG equipment, and eliminator equipment for our Italian military customer. We've been selected to supply the multifunction display for a digital cockpit upgrade for the U.S. Army's UH 60L to the US 60V configuration Black Hawk helicopters. We will provide our newest generation 10.4-inch digital electronic instrument displays for the  UH 60V cockpit, replacing the older analog gauges.
We have a variety of products tailored to the law enforcement market place and recently introduced our body vision camera to complement our line of in car recording and data management systems. Notably, we're responding to increased customer interest from police departments across the country.
We were selected to provide dynamic unit hybrid replacement units to the U.S. Army's Paladin and Paladin Integrated Management Programs.
Our WESCAM business serves a global base of military government and public safety customers and orders remain strong. This quarter, we were first to market with a 10-inch stabilized complete with new electro optic capabilities daylight spotted cameras. This new innovation is targeted for law enforcement and public safety customers.
In our Aviation Products sector, we are expanding our international footprint and advancing our investments with the new MRO facility in India.
For Aerospace Systems, we are focused on being an agile low cost provider and first to market with innovative technology. While this business has faced the Afghanistan drawdown and sequestration, it is well-equipped to address the U.S. DoD need for low-cost quick reaction fleet upgrades.
And the significant international win for the quarter, we were selected to provide mission data management systems for 2 maritime surveillance aircraft for the Japanese Coast Guard.
We received upgrade funding to support the Army fixed wing ISR aircraft as part of the program and received continued funding for our P3 work and a variety of legacy ISR programs, including Project Liberty.
We also received funding for wide bad SATCOM and Mission Communication Systems for national command assets using our airborne information management systems.
For Communication Systems, where we have a solid legacy of performance across those businesses, we had a number of long-term wins in this area. We're investing in A2AD and communication focused initiatives and are concentrating on margin improvement and manufacturing efficiencies. During the quarter, we received an order for network communications and data storage products in support of the B-52 upgrade program. We received funding for a variety of legacy programs, including ROVER, and the advanced Hawk Eye program for the Navy called Gray Eagle. As you see the rotors for our Traveling Wave Tube is for both satellite and missile programs.
Australia remains a strong market for Communication Systems. We support several Royal Australian Navy programs and very recently we were selected to supply high-performance wideband global SATCOM based SATCOM terminals to the Australian Defense force. L-3 GCS is leading this program and as part of a collaborative effort, we are also providing our network-centric waveform modem, which will enable the Australian forces to capitalize on the special features and benefits of the WGS satellite for the first time.
We're pursuing additional key new business opportunities internationally, including one in South Korea for unmanned underground sensors.
Next is NSS. In the context of this environment, NSS secured several strategic competitive awards during the quarter. As noted in the earnings release, NSS sales have been affected by completed contracts and work scope and budget reductions impacting programs across that business. The drawdown in Afghanistan and delayed contract awards were also factors in the quarter. Margins continue to be a challenge here, especially on new business, due to a very competitive marketplace. We won an important recompete for support of the U.S. Air Force's network operations and security center.
We also won another recompete for intelligence analysis language proficiency and area studies as part of the program. We received a delivery order for the special operations joint task force with telecommunication support and IT work. And we were reawarded a task order under the DIA SIA II vehicle to provide the joint intelligence operation center with intelligent support, including CI, analytic training, knowledge management, translation and ISR analytics and architecture as part of a 5-year program.
With regards to capital allocation and acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends are essential element of our capital deployment strategy and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver value to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $158 million to our shareholders, $100 million in common stock repurchases and $58 million in dividends. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase, raising it to 8% -- raising it 8% to $0.65 a share.
As I mentioned earlier, our acquisition strategy continues to support intelligent and disciplined growth. L-3 exercises a strict set of criteria in evaluating M&A candidates, focusing on companies that enhance our market share, expand our international and commercial opportunities and provide a good fit with our collaborative culture. Ending sequestration will enable our industry to plan more prudently, especially regarding IRAD that drives innovation and contributes to our ability to compete.
Now Ralph will review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."
93538,291883937,798816,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss in details about the first quarter results, in particular the unusual items and the variances from our outlook and then I'll review our update to the guidance for 2015, including explaining how our results will improve the re",1580,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss in details about the first quarter results, in particular the unusual items and the variances from our outlook and then I'll review our update to the guidance for 2015, including explaining how our results will improve the rest of this year from the first quarter to our full year estimates.
Our first quarter operating income margin and earnings per share were below our expectations primarily because of 2 items, which Mike touched upon and are covered in the earnings release. First, we incurred a nonoperating and nonrecurring impairment charge due to the decline in the euro of $0.18 from the Marine Systems International business that we're divesting. And secondly, we incurred additional charges on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts within the Aerospace Systems segment, which reduced EPS by $0.13. We are especially disappointed about the head-of-state contract losses. Except for these 2 items, the first quarter was generally in line or better than our outlook we provided on January 29.
Pro forma operating margin and EPS would have exceeded our first quarter outlook. Sales of $2,713,000,000 were on the low-end of our range, primarily due to softer MSI sales caused by the FX changes and the head-of-state contract loss adjustments impact on sales. Encouragingly, orders were higher than expected resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06. Also, cash collections were better than we anticipated, resulting in positive free cash flow for the first quarter.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.43 for the first quarter excludes the MSI divestiture impairment loss, and MSI is not going to be classified as discontinued operations in our results because the GAAP accounting rules for business dispositions recently changed. The MSI is clearly no longer an element of our ongoing operations, which is why we removed the impairment charge to calculate adjusted EPS.
Regarding the head-of-state aircraft modification charges, they relate to cost growth of schedule slips on 2 separate contracts with foreign customers, stemming largely from continued custom interior supply delays, quality problems and required rework. We expect to deliver one of those aircraft towards the end of June and the other at the end of this year in December. And until we deliver those 2 aircraft, we'll have lingering risks. We are addressing the contract performance issues at Platform Systems by realigning it with ISR Systems to strengthen leadership and management and to also ask stronger program management, engineering, subcontractor management and operations skill sets.
At the segment level, first quarter sales and margin for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were in line with our expectations. In Electronic Systems sales mix changes, mostly more commercial aviation product sales, offset lower volumes to hold core margin unchanged, and core margin excludes the higher pension expense that we're having this year.
At Communication Systems segment, you may recall that when we reported our 2014 fourth quarter results, I had explained that we had and shipped some high-margin SATCOM terminals sooner than we expected in December of last year. Well, those earlier shipments lowered the segment's 2015 first quarter results at Comm Systems. This is only a quarterly timing issue, which why it lowered the first quarter segment margin by 90 basis points at comp Communication Systems. It doesn't impact the full year estimates or guidance there.
For Aerospace Systems, the weaker first quarter results summarized to be $17 million of cost charges on those 2 head-of-state aircraft modification contracts.
And the NSS, sales and margins were lower due to continued delays in booking some high-margin international orders and slowed starts in transitions on several other recent new contracts, some caused by competitive protests. These items lowered first quarter sales and also absorption of overhead and G&A expenses at NSS. On a positive note, NSS had a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.25, supporting the sequential quarterly sales growth that we expect there the rest of this year.
Lastly, the first quarter free cash flow $47 million was a good start for the year as the first quarter is always our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter.
Moving onto the guidance update for 2015. Essentially all the changes that we made to our consolidated and also segment guidance pertain to the divestiture of MSI, which is scheduled to be completed on May 29. So we will move MSI from our estimates to the last 7 months of this year.
Adjusting for the MSI divestiture impairment loss which I talked about, our 2015 earnings per share is unchanged, with the range of $7.35 to $7.65. The additional share repurchases that we'll make using the MSI sales proceeds largely will offset the income removed from divesting MSI.
With respect to consolidated sales guidance, we lowered sales by $300 million to a range of $11.45 billion to $11.65 billion and that's due to the MSI divestiture, and we also raised our consolidated operating margin by 10 basis points to 9.4%, also due to removing MSI.
If MSI is excluded entirely from the full year sales and operating margin, sales would decline only by 2% and our operating margin for 2015 would be 9.5% percent.
In terms of our segment guidance update, other than adjusting Electronic Systems for the MSI divestiture, which lowers its sales by $300 million and raises the operating margin in Electronic Systems by 30 basis points, there are no other changes or items requiring explanation in the updated Electronic Systems guidance.
The guidance for the other segments remains the same. At Aerospace Systems, we have guidance unchanged despite the first quarter head-of-state aircraft modification losses because we had deliberately planned 2015 with conservatism for Aerospace Systems and we entered the year with some solid upside opportunities there. We commented on a few of these opportunities over the last few months and they will happen, and they are enabling Aerospace Systems to maintain its guidance for the full year. These upsides pertain to additional work on the Liberty small ISR aircraft; a profitable contract extension, which we expect to receive on the Army C12 contracts; and generally better contract performance on international ISR Systems contracts.
At Communication Systems, we booked a large international SATCOM terminal contract 2 weeks ago, and that with second half ramp ups on WIN-T, a variety of data links and terminals will increase sales and margin in the Comm System segment rest of this year. These items are not changes to the guidance as we had contemplated them in our initial 2015 guidance for Communication Systems.
Finally, regarding a segment guidance, I want to explain how and why we expect NSS sales and margins to increase from the first quarter for the rest of this year. NSS sequential sales volumes will increase by about $30 million per quarter, with the recent new start and contract award that I talked about in my first quarter comments. And NSS sales are also expected to increase another $75 million after the first quarter from those higher margin international and commercial sales orders.
On the margin in NSS, we expect 3 drivers to increase margin from 4.5% in the first quarter to our full year guidance midpoint of 6.7%. First, a higher-margin international commercial sales adds about 120 basis points. Secondly, the increased sales volumes that I talked about will add another 60 basis points. And finally, higher award fees that we expect in the second half of this year adds the remaining 40 basis points to margins. And on the award fees, as you may know, we record them when they're earned. We don't accrue them on a quarterly basis.
The tax rate for 2015 remains unchanged at 32% and it continues to assume no federal R&E tax credit. That's an important credit for L-3. If it gets reenacted, which we expect will happen at some point, and may not happen in 2015, but we expect to have an R&E credit in the future. And in the event if it does get reenacted, it lowers our tax rate by about 220 basis points and would increase our EPS by about $0.24.
We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of about $925 million, and that's despite the MSI divestiture. So our free cash flow per share will exceed $11 per share in 2015, and that will provide a cash flow yield north of 9%.
With respect to our capital allocation, we are increasing our estimated share repurchases by $300 million to $800 million as I talked about for the MSI divestiture proceeds. And after we make those share repurchases and also pay our dividend, we expect that we'll end this year with about $750 million of cash, so we'll have flexibility for more capital deployment.
For the full year, we still expect book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.0.
With respect to our second quarter outlook, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, margin in the high 8% range, EPS between $1.60 and $1.70, our free cash flow approximately between $100 million and $200 million and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0.
So to conclude my financial review, the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16. Although our first quarter was a slow start for the year, our order flow is improving and we expect our financial performance to improve sequentially, especially in the second half of this year. We continue to generate robust cash flow and we'll continue to allocate capital to increase shareholder value.
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

I wanted to ask you about share buybacks and M&A but as it relates to S&P's recently revised outlook here. I wanted to know if you could tell us about any of discussions you're having here with S&P regarding their outlook?

And based upon those meetings and the way a company's results have been trending, I'm talking about the credit ratios and credit metrics in this instance here, and they look to what we've been doing, and clearly we have employed [ph] a lot of debt in our capital structure, which per our investment-grade credit ratings are near or above the limit in terms of what the rating agencies like to see. And that's what's being reflected in their outlook changes from stable to negative. In both instances, end of February and just yesterday, S&P, end of February was Moody's, they both reaffirmed our ratings and they're essentially telling us they want to see -- they don't want to see any further deterioration in the credit metrics and, in some cases, some improvements. So we're mindful of that. We think we have adequate cash flow and cash to continue to do what we're doing with the capital allocation in terms of the dividends and the share buybacks and also manage the credit ratings effectively. So the way you do that is, if we make some acquisitions, and to the extent that we did, they would be profitable businesses, which would improve our EBITDA and lower the leverage. That's one way to improve the credit metrics. The second way is that we expect that we're going to have natural organic improvement on our business the next year or so as we come out of the downturn, particularly with the DoD budgets. And lastly, we could also repay some debt. So we have the ability to use any of those items in order to manage the credit ratings, and that's how we are considering it."

Certainly communication products, very strong demand. So we have the event-driven growth. We have the fact that the budget request is an improvement from where we've been and the fact that we see real growth starting in '16. Even with sequestration there, there's growth. So the trends are changing as we look out. So I don't think it will happen overnight, but it should gradually improve over the next 18 months, it's our view."

In fact, last year, we won virtually every recompete that we participated in.

In fact, last year, we won virtually every recompete that we participated in. And they've done a very good job in the proposal process in winning business against bigger players that are bigger players period. And the performance of the contract execution has been very good, their c plus or their ratings have been outstanding. And the hesitancy on this side, which I'm sure you read, is that in the world that we're in where there seems to be a cyber element in everything, whether it's a communications systems, contract or of course anything in the IT domain and many of the places, diversified defense company, would it be prudent to not have a cyber element within the company. So that's something that we're paying a lot of attention to. Since we do have some significant capability in that space, you just look at some of the recent wins that we've had with the NSA and other customers, they're well thought up and they do have unique offering with a very dedicated, skilled workforce. So I mean, they do well. Now I don't -- I thought about it in terms of management, can we take more cost out, we really are running a lean operation and I attribute it more to the space that they're in and the dynamics in that space, more recompetitions, breaking contracts into smaller pieces and the fact that there are just a lot of players there that are all scrapping for some top line growth in they're willing to bid lower and lower numbers. And better buying power encourages that and the like. So it's a question of the space they're in right now. Now you could look at this as a cycle also, that this too will turn, because I don't know that going to the lowest price bidder will save the day every time on the customer side. I think it would probably be the most qualified bidder. And we've been trying to gradually move to higher margin work and when you say walk away, yes, we would walk away from work at 3% or 4%, 2% or 3% if we had to. But we'd like to still get the DoD focused your best value, which means putting out the best proposal if you will or the best quality at the best price. So there's still time to be played out here in terms of whether this trend will change and we can see some improvement in the margins. But having a flat top line or shrinking top line and shrinking margins at the same time is not a type of business that we like to participate in. So if that continues, you can assume what our answer is going to be."

Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.06x for the quarter reinforces our growth strategy and outlook for the full year, where we expect our 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0x. We continue to execute and deliver operational performance on the majority of our programs, however, we experienced additional cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts due to supplier issues, causing schedule slip and substantial rework. We also had continued delayed contract awards in our NSS segment, both of which impacted our first quarter performance. 
We have recently integrated our Platform Systems business into our ISR Systems sector to strengthen management and enhance multiple skill sets to improve program performance at Platform Systems. 
There are a number of key competitive wins that would not be possible without the efforts of our employees and our management team. And as always, I thank them for their consistent hard work, especially in focusing on our strategy of expanding our international and commercial footprint. The fundamental growth drivers of our business remained strong during the first quarter. We had net sales of $2.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of just over 8% compared with the 2014 first quarter. Net sales to international and commercial customers, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, increased slightly from 29% to 30% year-over-year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.43, down from $1.90 in the first quarter of 2014. This excludes an $0.18 charge related to the sale of our Marine Systems International business.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $87 million. This is an improvement over the first quarter of '14, when we used $62 million in net cash.
Funded orders for the quarter were $2.9 billion, a 4% decrease year-over-year. Funded backlog increased about 1% to $10.3 billion compared to $10.2 billion at year-end 2014.
Investment in our business remains a priority, and we have increased our focus on technology and investment and we'll continue this with the expectation that IRAD will constitute close to 2.5% of 2015 revenues.
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers. Across L-3's business, we continue to focus on payloads, not platforms, as an approach, to upgrade and enhance our customer offerings and to provide the best technology available. This keeps us well aligned with DoD initiatives like Better Buying Power 3.0.
Several of our key wins in the quarter, including our photonics mast work, our Virginia class submarines and our advanced display selected for the U.S. Army's Black Hawk helicopters are examples of this approach.
In keeping with our strategy, we are taking the appropriate actions to enhance our ability to anticipate and effectively address customer priorities and to promote growth. As we remain focused on our core businesses, we continuously bolster our profitability through better integration and collaboration across the company to both reduce cost as well as increased productivity.
The integration of Narda and the recently acquired MITEQ business into our Communication Systems business is proceeding on pace and is a good addition to that segment. And the sale of our Marine Systems International business has received the necessary regulatory approvals and is now on track to be completed in the second quarter.
We recently sold our broadcast sports business to a private equity firm, though small, this disposition is consistent with our strategy to continuously evaluate our portfolio and divest non-core businesses to strengthen our core businesses and better position us to capture growth opportunities. These divestitures demonstrate our focus on building our core business, improving margins and enhancing our future growth profile. And each of these transactions is evidence of our disciplined business portfolio strategy.
On the acquisition front, overall M&A activity levels in our markets are increasing. We fully expect to continue to add to our portfolio with a view towards expanding our business space and delivering value that addresses our customer priorities. We are attuned to the industry and market conditions. We have a proven strategy in place with a focus on increasing market share and staying agile to take advantage of growth opportunities.
Now I'll make some brief comments on our business segment performance and touch on significant awards and milestones.
First off, in Electronic Systems, which is our largest segment, we continue to seek out new opportunities to gain market share. We've been focused on increasing margins in this area as well. Nearly 1/2 of this business is international and commercial and it's growing. We received ongoing orders and funding in the quarter for a wide range of projects, including the Ship-to-Shore Connector, Hercules engines and our security and detection systems products. This includes an order for our ProVision 2 screening systems for the TSA.
Link U.K. continues to increase its customer base with an award to provide Boeing 787 training devices to Virgin Atlantic Airways. We were recently awarded a contract for our unique photonic mast. This is a significant win for L-3 and provides the U.S. Navy with new stealth technology for submarines.
In support of the Navy ship modernization program, we were selected to provide a variety of services aimed at increasing readiness and reducing maintenance and workload requirements. This also positions L-3 for a range of similar international pursuits.
We were awarded a contract by USSOCOM for binocular night vision devices, and we are seeing ongoing strong orders for our ENVG equipment, weapon sights and illuminator equipment for our Italian military customer. We've been selected to supply the multifunction display for a digital cockpit upgrade for the U.S. Army's UH-60L to the UH-60V configuration Black Hawk helicopters. 
We will provide our newest-generation 10.4-inch digital electronic instrument displays for the UH-60V cockpit, replacing the older analog gauges.
We have a variety of products tailored to the law enforcement marketplace and recently introduced our body vision camera to complement our line of in-car recording and data management systems. Notably, we're responding to increased customer interest from police departments across the country.
We were selected to provide Dynamic Unit Hybrid Replacement units to the U.S. Army's Paladin and Paladin Integrated Management Programs.
Our WESCAM business serves a global base of military government and public safety customers and orders remain strong. This quarter, we were first to market with a 10-inch stabilized turret complete with new electro-optic capabilities and daylight spotter cameras. This new innovation is targeted for law enforcement and public safety customers.
In our Aviation Products sector, we are expanding our international footprint and advancing our investments with the new MRO facility in India.
The Aerospace Systems were focused on being an agile, low-cost provider and first to market with innovative technology. While this business has faced the Afghanistan drawdown and sequestration, it is well-equipped to address the U.S. DoD need for low-cost quick reaction fleet upgrades.
And a significant international win for the quarter, we were selected to provide mission data management systems for 2 maritime surveillance aircraft for the Japanese Coast Guard.
We received upgrade funding to support the Army Fixed-Wing ISR aircraft as part of the Constant Hawk program and received continued funding for our P-3 work and a variety of legacy ISR programs, including Project Liberty.
We also received funding for Wideband SATCOM and mission communication systems for national command assets using our airborne information management system.
Communication Systems, where we have a solid legacy of performance across those businesses, we had a number of long-term wins in this area. We're investing in A2AD and communication-focused initiatives and are concentrating on margin improvement and manufacturing efficiencies. During the quarter, we received an order for network communications and data storage products in support of the B-52 upgrade program. We received funding for a variety of legacy programs, including ROVER, WIN-T and the advanced Hawkeye program for the Navy called Gray Eagle. We also received orders for our Traveling-Wave Tubes for both satellite and missile programs.
Australia remains a strong market for Communication Systems. We support several Royal Australian Navy programs. And very recently, we were selected to supply high-performance Wideband Global SATCOM-based SATCOM terminals to the Australian Defense force. L-3 GCS is leading this program. And as part of a collaborative effort, we are also providing our network-centric waveform modem, which will enable the Australian forces to capitalize on the special features and benefits of the WGS satellite for the first time.
We're pursuing additional key new business opportunities internationally, including one in South Korea for Unattended Ground Sensors.
Next is NSS. In the context of this environment, NSS secured several strategic competitive awards during the quarter. As noted in the earnings release, NSS sales have been affected by completed contracts and work scope and budget reductions impacting programs across that business. The drawdown in Afghanistan and delayed contract awards were also factors in the quarter. Margins continue to be a challenge here, especially on new business, due to a very competitive marketplace. We won an important recompete for support of the U.S. Air Force's network operations and security center.
We also won another recompete for intelligence analysis, language proficiency and area studies as part of the Claret program. 
We received a delivery order for the special operations joint task force with deployed communication support and IT work. And we were re-awarded a task order under the DIA SIA II vehicle to provide the CENTCOM Joint Intelligence Operations Center with intelligent support, including CI, HUMINT analytical training, knowledge management, translation and ISR analytics and architecture as part of a 5-year program.
With regards to capital allocation and acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends are essential element of our capital deployment strategy and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver value to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $158 million to our shareholders, $100 million in common stock repurchases and $58 million in dividends. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase, raising it to 8% -- raising it 8% to $0.65 a share.
As I mentioned earlier, our acquisition strategy continues to support intelligent and disciplined growth. L-3 exercises a strict set of criteria in evaluating M&A candidates, focusing on companies that enhance our market share, expand our international and commercial opportunities and provide a good fit with our collaborative culture. Ending sequestration will enable our industry to plan more prudently, especially regarding IRAD that drives innovation and contributes to our ability to compete.
Now Ralph will review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."

And secondly, we incurred additional charges on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts within the Aerospace Systems segment, which reduced EPS by $0.13. 
We're especially disappointed about -- by the head-of-state contract losses. Except for these 2 items, the first quarter was generally in line or better than our outlook we provided on January 29.
Pro forma operating margin and EPS would have exceeded our first quarter outlook. Sales of $2,713,000,000 were on the low-end of our range, primarily due to softer MSI sales caused by the FX changes and the head-of-state contract loss adjustments impact on sales. 
Encouragingly, orders were higher than we expected resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06x. Also, cash collections were better than we anticipated, resulting in positive free cash flow for the first quarter.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.43 for the first quarter excludes the MSI divestiture impairment loss, and MSI is not going to be classified as discontinued operation in our results because the GAAP accounting rules for business dispositions recently changed. But MSI is clearly no longer an element of our ongoing operations, which is why we removed the impairment charge to calculate adjusted EPS.
Regarding the head-of-state aircraft modification charges, they relate to cost growth of schedule slips on 2 separate contracts with foreign customers, stemming largely from continued custom interior supply delays, quality problems and required rework. We expect to deliver one of those aircraft towards the end of June and the other at the end of this year in December. And until we deliver those 2 aircraft, we'll have lingering risks. We are addressing the contract performance issues at Platform Systems by realigning it with ISR Systems to strengthen leadership and management and to also add stronger program management, engineering, subcontractor management and operations skill sets.
At the segment level, first quarter sales and margin for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were in line with our expectations. In Electronic Systems, sales mix changes, mostly more commercial aviation product sales, offset lower volumes to hold core margin unchanged. And core margin excludes the higher pension expense that we're having this year.
At Communication Systems segment, you may recall that when we reported our 2014 fourth quarter results, I had explained that we had booked and shipped some high-margin SATCOM terminals sooner than we expected in December of last year. While those earlier shipments lowered the segment's 2015 first quarter results at Comm Systems, this is only a quarterly timing issue, which lowered the first quarter segment margin by 90 basis points at Communication Systems. It doesn't impact the full year estimates or guidance there.
For Aerospace Systems, the weaker first quarter results summarized to be $17 million of cost growth charges on those 2 head-of-state aircraft modification contracts.
And the NSS, sales and margins were lower due to continued delays in booking some high-margin international orders and slowed starts in transitions on several recent new contracts, some caused by competitive protest. These items lowered first quarter sales and also absorption of overhead and G&A expenses at NSS. 
On a positive note, NSS had a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.25x, supporting the sequential quarterly sales growth that we expect there the rest of this year.
Lastly, the first quarter free cash flow of $47 million was a good start for the year as the first quarter is always our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter.
Moving on to the guidance update for 2015. Essentially all the changes that we made to our consolidated and also segment guidance pertain to the divestiture of MSI, which is scheduled to be completed on May 29. So we will move MSI from our estimates to the last 7 months of this year.
Adjusting for the MSI divestiture impairment loss which I talked about, our 2015 earnings per share is unchanged with the range of $7.35 to $7.65. The additional share repurchases that we'll make -- use in the MSI sales proceeds largely will offset the income removed from divesting MSI.
With respect to consolidated sales guidance, we've lowered sales by $300 million to a range of $11.45 billion to $11.65 billion and that's due to the MSI divestiture, and we also raised our consolidated operating margin by 10 basis points to 9.4%, also due to removing MSI.
If MSI is excluded entirely from the full year sales and operating margin, sales will decline only by 2% and our operating margin for 2015 would be 9.5%.
In terms of our segment guidance update, other than adjusting Electronic Systems for the MSI divestiture, which lowers its sales by $300 million and raises the operating margin in Electronic Systems by 30 basis points, there are no other changes or items requiring explanation in the updated Electronic Systems guidance.
Guidance for the other segments remains the same. At Aerospace Systems, we held guidance unchanged despite the first quarter head-of-state aircraft modification losses because we had deliberately planned 2015 with conservatism for Aerospace Systems, and we entered the year with some solid upside opportunities there. We commented on a few of these opportunities over the last few months and they will happen, and they are enabling Aerospace Systems to maintain its guidance for the full year. These upsides pertain to additional work on the Liberty small ISR aircraft, a profitable contract extension, which we expect to receive in the Army C-12 contract and generally better contract performance on international ISR Systems contracts.
At Communication Systems, we booked a large international SATCOM terminal contract 2 weeks ago, and that with second half ramp-ups on WIN-T, a variety of data links and of ROVER terminals will increase sales and margin in the Comm Systems segment rest of this year. These items are not changes to the guidance as we had contemplated them in our initial 2015 guidance for Communication Systems.
Finally, regarding our segment guidance, I want to explain how and why we expect NSS sales and margins to increase from the first quarter through the rest of this year. 
NSS sequential sales volumes will increase by about $30 million per quarter, with the recent new start and contract awards that I talked about in my first quarter comments. And NSS sales are also expected to increase another $75 million after the first quarter from those higher-margin international and commercial sales orders.
On the margin at NSS, we expect 3 drivers to increase margin from 4.5% in the first quarter to our full year guidance midpoint of 6.7%. First, the higher-margin international commercial sales adds about 120 basis points. Secondly, the increased sales volumes that I talked about will add another 60 basis points. And finally, higher award fees that we expect in the second half of this year adds the remaining 40 basis points to margins. And on the award fees, as you may know, we record them when they're earned. We don't accrue them on a quarterly basis.
The tax rate for 2015 remains unchanged at 32% and it continues to assume no Federal R&E tax credit. That's an important credit for L-3 if it gets reenacted, which we expect will happen at some point. It may not happen in 2015, but we expect to have an R&E credit in the future. In any event, if it does get reenacted, it lowers our tax rate by about 220 basis points and would increase our EPS by about $0.24.
We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of about $925 million, and that's despite the MSI divestiture. So our free cash flow per share will exceed $11 per share in 2015, and that will provide a cash flow yield north of 9%.
With respect to our capital allocation, we are increasing our estimated share repurchases by $300 million to $800 million as I talked about for the MSI divestiture proceeds. And after we make those share repurchases and also pay our dividend, we expect that we'll end this year with about $750 million of cash, so we'll have flexibility for more capital deployment.
For the full year, we still expect a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.0x.
With respect to our second quarter outlook, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, margin in the high 8% range, EPS between $1.60 and $1.70, our free cash flow approximately between $100 million and $200 million and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x.
So to conclude my financial review, the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16. Although our first quarter was a slow start for the year, our order flow is improving and we expect our financial performance to improve sequentially, especially in the second half of this year. We continue to generate robust cash flow and we'll continue to allocate capital to increase shareholder value.
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

And based upon those meetings and the way our company's results have been trending, and I'm talking about the credit ratios and credit metrics in this instance here, and they look at what we've been doing, and clearly we have employed a lot of debt in our capital structure, which, per our investment-grade credit ratings, are near or above the limit in terms of what the rating agencies like to see. And that's what's being reflected in their outlook changes from stable to negative. In both instances, end of February and just yesterday, S&P, end of February was Moody's, they both reaffirmed our ratings and they're essentially telling us they want to see -- they don't want to see any further deterioration in the credit metrics and, in some cases, some improvements. So we're mindful of that. We think we have adequate cash flow and cash to continue to do what we're doing with the capital allocation in terms of the dividends and the share buybacks and also manage the credit ratings effectively. So the way you do that is, if we make some acquisitions, and to the extent that we did, they would be profitable businesses, which would improve our EBITDA and lower the leverage. That's one way to improve the credit metrics. The second way is that we expect that we're going to have natural organic improvement in our business the next year or so as we come out of the downturn, particularly with the DoD budgets. And lastly, we could also repay some debt. So we have the ability to use any of those items in order to manage the credit ratings, and that's how we're considering it."

There is continued demand for ISR assets, whether they're aircraft, the data links or cameras that go on them and as well as support on the ground, whether it be SOCOM or night vision products and the like. Certainly communication products, a very strong demand. So we have the event-driven growth. We have the fact that the budget request is an improvement from where we've been and the fact that we see real growth starting in '16, even with sequestration there, there's growth. So the trends are changing as we look out. So I don't think it will happen overnight, but it should gradually improve over the next 18 months is our view."

In fact, last year, we won virtually every recompete that we participated in. And they've done a very good job in the proposal process in winning business against bigger players -- that are bigger players, period. And the performance of the contract execution has been very good. They are C+ or their ratings have been outstanding. And the hesitancy on this side, which I'm sure you read, is that in the world that we're in where there seems to be a cyber element in everything, whether it's a communications systems contract or of course anything in the IT domain in many of the places, diversified defense company, would it be prudent to not have a cyber element within the company. So that's something that we are paying a lot of attention to. Since we do have some significant capability in that space, you just look at some of the recent wins that we've had with the NSA and other customers. They're well thought of and they do have unique offering with a very dedicated, skilled workforce. So I mean, they do well. Now I don't -- I thought about it in terms of management, can we take more cost out, we really are running a lean operation and I attribute it more to the space that they're in and the dynamics in that space, more recompetitions, breaking contracts into smaller pieces and the fact that there are just a lot of players there that are all scrapping for some top line growth and they are willing to bid lower and lower numbers, and Better Buying Power encourages that and the like. So it's a question of the space they're in right now. Now you could look at this as a cycle also, that this, too, will turn, because I don't know that going to the lowest price bidder will save the day every time on the customer side. I think it'll probably be the most qualified bidder. And we've been trying to gradually move to higher-margin work. And when you say walk away, yes, we would walk away from work at 3% or 4%, 2% or 3% if we had to, but we'd like to still get in the DoD focus area of your best value, which means putting out the best proposal, if you will, or the best quality at the best price. So there's still time to be played out here in terms of whether this trend will change and we can see some improvement in the margins. But having a flat top line or a shrinking top line and shrinking margins at the same time is not a type of business that we'd like to participate in. So if that continues, you could assume what our answer is going to be."

This quarter, we had solid funded orders and positive cash flow. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.06x for the quarter reinforces our growth strategy and outlook for the full year, where we expect our 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0x. We continue to execute and deliver operational performance on the majority of our programs, however, we experienced additional cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts due to supplier issues, causing schedule slip and substantial rework. We also had continued delayed contract awards in our NSS segment, both of which impacted our first quarter performance. 
We have recently integrated our Platform Systems business into our ISR Systems sector to strengthen management and enhance multiple skill sets to improve program performance at Platform Systems. 
There were a number of key competitive wins that would not be possible without the efforts of our employees and our management team. And as always, I thank them for their consistent hard work, especially in focusing on our strategy of expanding our international and commercial footprint. The fundamental growth drivers of our business remained strong during the first quarter. We had net sales of $2.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of just over 8% compared with the 2014 first quarter. Net sales to international and commercial customers, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, increased slightly from 29% to 30% year-over-year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.43, down from $1.90 in the first quarter of 2014. This excludes an $0.18 charge related to the sale of our Marine Systems International business.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $87 million. This is an improvement over the first quarter of '14, when we used $62 million in net cash.
Funded orders for the quarter were $2.9 billion, a 4% decrease year-over-year. Funded backlog increased about 1% to $10.3 billion compared to $10.2 billion at year-end 2014.
Investment in our business remains a priority, and we have increased our focus on technology and investment and we'll continue this with the expectation that IRAD will constitute close to 2.5% of 2015 revenues.
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers. Across L-3's business, we continue to focus on payloads, not platforms, as an approach, to upgrade and enhance our customer offerings and to provide the best technology available. This keeps us well aligned with DoD initiatives like Better Buying Power 3.0.
Several of our key wins in the quarter, including our photonics mast work, our Virginia class submarines and our advanced displays selected for the U.S. Army's Black Hawk helicopters are examples of this approach.
In keeping with our strategy, we are taking the appropriate actions to enhance our ability to anticipate and effectively address customer priorities and to promote growth. As we remain focused on our core businesses, we continuously bolster our profitability through better integration and collaboration across the company to both reduce costs as well as increased productivity.
The integration of Narda and the recently acquired MITEQ business into our Communication Systems business is proceeding on pace and is a good addition to that segment. And the sale of our Marine Systems International business has received the necessary regulatory approvals and is now on track to be completed in the second quarter.
We recently sold our Broadcast Sports business to a private equity firm. Though small, this disposition is consistent with our strategy to continuously evaluate our portfolio, and divest non-core businesses to strengthen our core businesses and better position us to capture growth opportunities. These divestitures demonstrate our focus on building our core business, improving margins and enhancing our future growth profile. And each of these transactions is evidence of our disciplined business portfolio strategy.
On the acquisition front, overall M&A activity levels in our markets are increasing. We fully expect to continue to add to our portfolio with a view towards expanding our business base and delivering value that addresses our customer priorities. We are attuned to the industry and market conditions. We have a proven strategy in place with a focus on increasing market share and staying agile to take advantage of growth opportunities.
Now I'll make some brief comments on our business segment performance and touch on significant awards and milestones.
First off, in Electronic Systems, which is our largest segment, we continue to seek out new opportunities to gain market share. We've been focused on increasing margins in this area as well. Nearly 1/2 of this business is international and commercial and it's growing. We received ongoing orders and funding in the quarter for a wide range of projects, including the Ship-to-Shore Connector, Hercules engines and our Security & Detection Systems products. This includes an order for our ProVision 2 screening systems for the TSA.
Link U.K. continues to increase its customer base with an award to provide Boeing 787 training devices to Virgin Atlantic Airways. We were recently awarded a contract for our unique photonic mast. This is a significant win for L-3 and provides the U.S. Navy with new stealth technology for submarines.
In support of the Navy ship modernization program, we were selected to provide a variety of services aimed at increasing readiness and reducing maintenance and workload requirements. This also positions L-3 for a range of similar international pursuits.
We were awarded a contract by USSOCOM for binocular night vision devices, and we are seeing ongoing strong orders for our ENVG equipment, weapon sights and illuminator equipment for our Italian military customer. We've been selected to supply the multifunction display for a digital cockpit upgrade for the U.S. Army's UH-60L to the UH-60V configuration Black Hawk helicopters. 
We will provide our newest-generation 10.4-inch digital electronic instrument displays for the UH-60V cockpit, replacing the older analog gauges.
We have a variety of products tailored to the law enforcement marketplace and recently introduced our body vision camera to complement our line of in-car recording and data management systems. Notably, we're responding to increased customer interest from police departments across the country.
We were selected to provide Dynamic Unit Hybrid Replacement units to the U.S. Army's Paladin and Paladin Integrated Management Programs.
Our WESCAM business serves a global base of military government and public safety customers, and orders remain strong. This quarter, we were first to market with a 10-inch stabilized turret complete with new electro-optic capabilities and daylight spotter cameras. This new innovation is targeted for law enforcement and public safety customers.
In our Aviation Products sector, we are expanding our international footprint and advancing our investments with the new MRO facility in India.
For Aerospace Systems we're focused on being an agile, low-cost provider and first to market with innovative technology. While this business has faced the Afghanistan drawdown and sequestration, it is well equipped to address the U.S. DoD need for low-cost quick reaction fleet upgrades.
In a significant international win for the quarter, we were selected to provide mission data management systems for 2 maritime surveillance aircraft for the Japanese Coast Guard.
We received upgrade funding to support the Army Fixed-Wing ISR aircraft as part of the Constant Hawk program and received continued funding for our P-3 work and a variety of legacy ISR programs, including Project Liberty.
We also received funding for Wideband SATCOM and mission communication systems for national command assets using our airborne information management system.
For Communication Systems, where we have a solid legacy of performance across those businesses, we had a number of long-term wins in this area. We're investing in A2AD and communication-focused initiatives and are concentrating on margin improvement and manufacturing efficiencies. During the quarter, we received an order for network communications and data storage products in support of the B-52 upgrade program. We received funding for a variety of legacy programs, including ROVER, WIN-T and the advanced Hawkeye program for the Navy called Gray Eagle. We also received orders for our Traveling-Wave Tubes for both satellite and missile programs.
Australia remains a strong market for Communication Systems. We support several Royal Australian Navy programs. And very recently, we were selected to supply high-performance Wideband Global SATCOM-based SATCOM terminals to the Australian Defense force. L-3 GCS is leading this program. And as part of a collaborative effort, we are also providing our network-centric waveform modem, which will enable the Australian forces to capitalize on the special features and benefits of the WGS satellite for the first time.
We're pursuing additional key new business opportunities internationally, including one in South Korea for Unattended Ground Sensors.
Next is NSS. In the context of this environment, NSS secured several strategic competitive awards during the quarter. As noted in the earnings release, NSS sales have been affected by completed contracts and work scope and budget reductions impacting programs across that business. The drawdown in Afghanistan and delayed contract awards were also factors in the quarter. Margins continue to be a challenge here, especially on new business, due to a very competitive marketplace. We won an important recompete for support of the U.S. Air Force's network operations and security center.
We also won another recompete for intelligence analysis, language proficiency and area studies as part of the Claret program. 
We received a delivery order for the Special Operations Joint Task Force with deployed communication support and IT work. And we were re-awarded a task order under the DIA SIA II vehicle to provide the CENTCOM Joint Intelligence Operations Center with intelligence support, including CI, HUMINT analytical training, knowledge management, translation and ISR analytics and architecture as part of a 5-year program.
With regards to capital allocation and acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends are a central element of our capital deployment strategy and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver value to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $158 million to our shareholders, $100 million in common stock repurchases and $58 million in dividends. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase, raising it to 8% -- raising it 8% to $0.65 a share.
As I mentioned earlier, our acquisition strategy continues to support intelligent and disciplined growth. L-3 exercises a strict set of criteria in evaluating M&A candidates, focusing on companies that enhance our market share, expand our international and commercial opportunities and provide a good fit with our collaborative culture. Ending sequestration will enable our industry to plan more prudently, especially regarding IRAD that drives innovation and contributes to our ability to compete.
Now Ralph will review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."
93538,291883937,799306,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss in details about the first quarter results, in particular, the unusual items and the variances from our outlook. And then I'll review our update to the guidance for 2015, including explaining how our results will improve the",1582,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss in details about the first quarter results, in particular, the unusual items and the variances from our outlook. And then I'll review our update to the guidance for 2015, including explaining how our results will improve the rest of this year from the first quarter to our full year estimates.
Our first quarter operating income margin and earnings per share were below our expectations, primarily because of 2 items, which Mike touched upon and are covered in the earnings release. First, we incurred a nonoperating and nonrecurring impairment charge due to the decline in the euro of $0.18 on the unit assets for the Marine Systems International business that we're divesting. And secondly, we incurred additional charges on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts within the Aerospace Systems segment, which reduced EPS by $0.13. 
We're especially disappointed by the head-of-state contract losses. Except for these 2 items, the first quarter was generally in line or better than our outlook we provided on January 29.
Pro forma operating margin and EPS would have exceeded our first quarter outlook. Sales of $2,713,000,000 were on the low-end of our range, primarily due to softer MSI sales caused by the FX changes and the head-of-state contract loss adjustment's impact on sales. 
Encouragingly, orders were higher than we expected resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06x. Also, cash collections were better than we anticipated, resulting in positive free cash flow for the first quarter.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.43 for the first quarter excludes the MSI divestiture impairment loss, and MSI is not going to be classified as discontinued operation in our results because the GAAP accounting rules for business dispositions recently changed. But MSI is clearly no longer an element of our ongoing operations, which is why we removed the impairment charge to calculate adjusted EPS.
Regarding the head-of-state aircraft modification charges, they relate to cost growth of schedule slips on 2 separate contracts with foreign customers, stemming largely from continued custom interior supplier delays, quality problems and required rework. We expect to deliver one of those aircraft towards the end of June and the other at the end of this year in December. And until we deliver those 2 aircraft, we'll have lingering risks. We are addressing the contract performance issues at Platform Systems by realigning it with ISR Systems to strengthen leadership and management and to also add stronger program management, engineering, subcontractor management and operations skill sets.
At the segment level, first quarter sales and margin for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were in line with our expectations. In Electronic Systems, sales mix changes, mostly more commercial aviation product sales, offset lower volumes to hold core margin unchanged. And core margin excludes the higher pension expense that we're having this year.
At Communication Systems segment, you may recall that when we reported our 2014 fourth quarter results, I had explained that we had booked and shipped some high-margin SATCOM terminals sooner than we expected in December of last year. While those earlier shipments lowered the segment's 2015 first quarter results at Comm Systems, this is only a quarterly timing issue, which lowered the first quarter segment margin by 90 basis points at Communication Systems. It doesn't impact the full year estimates or guidance there.
For Aerospace Systems, the weaker first quarter results summarized to be $17 million of cost growth charges on those 2 head-of-state aircraft modification contracts.
And at NSS, sales and margins were lower due to continued delays in booking some high-margin international orders and slowed starts in transitions on several recent new contracts, some caused by competitor protest. These items lowered first quarter sales and also absorption of overhead and G&A expenses at NSS. 
On a positive note, NSS had a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.25x, supporting the sequential quarterly sales growth that we expect there the rest of this year.
Lastly, the first quarter free cash flow of $47 million was a good start for the year as the first quarter is always our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter.
Moving on to the guidance update for 2015. Essentially all the changes that we made to our consolidated and also segment guidance pertain to the divestiture of MSI, which is scheduled to be completed on May 29. So we removed MSI from our estimates for the last 7 months of this year.
Adjusting for the MSI divestiture impairment loss which I talked about, our 2015 earnings per share is unchanged with the range of $7.35 to $7.65. The additional share repurchases that we'll make, using the MSI sales proceeds, largely will offset the income removed from divesting MSI.
With respect to consolidated sales guidance, we've lowered sales by $300 million to a range of $11.45 billion to $11.65 billion and that's due to the MSI divestiture, and we also raised our consolidated operating margin by 10 basis points to 9.4%, also due to removing MSI.
If MSI is excluded entirely from the full year sales and operating margin, sales will decline only by 2% and our operating margin for 2015 would be 9.5%.
In terms of our segment guidance update, other than adjusting Electronic Systems for the MSI divestiture, which lowers its sales by $300 million and raises the operating margin in Electronic Systems by 30 basis points, there are no other changes or items requiring explanation in the updated Electronic Systems guidance.
Guidance for the other segments remains the same. At Aerospace Systems, we held guidance unchanged despite the first quarter head-of-state aircraft modification losses because we had deliberately planned 2015 with conservatism for Aerospace Systems, and we entered the year with some solid upside opportunities there. We commented on a few of these opportunities over the last few months and they will happen, and they are enabling Aerospace Systems to maintain its guidance for the full year. These upsides pertain to additional work on the Liberty small ISR aircraft, a profitable contract extension, which we expect to receive in the Army C-12 contract, and generally better contract performance on international ISR Systems contracts.
At Communication Systems, we booked a large international SATCOM terminal contract 2 weeks ago, and that, with second half ramp-ups on WIN-T, a variety of data links and of ROVER terminals will increase sales and margin in the Comm Systems segment the rest of this year. These items are not changes to the guidance as we had contemplated them in our initial 2015 guidance for Communication Systems.
Finally, regarding our segment guidance, I want to explain how and why we expect NSS sales and margins to increase from the first quarter through the rest of this year. 
NSS sequential sales volumes will increase by about $30 million per quarter, with the recent new start and contract awards that I talked about in my first quarter comments. And NSS sales are also expected to increase another $75 million after the first quarter from those higher-margin international and commercial sales orders.
On the margin at NSS, we expect 3 drivers to increase margin from 4.5% in the first quarter to our full year guidance midpoint of 6.7%. First, the higher-margin international commercial sales adds about 120 basis points. Secondly, the increased sales volumes that I talked about will add another 60 basis points. And finally, higher award fees that we expect in the second half of this year adds the remaining 40 basis points to margins. And on the award fees, as you may know, we record them when they're earned. We don't accrue them on a quarterly basis.
The tax rate for 2015 remains unchanged at 32% and it continues to assume no Federal R&E tax credit. That's an important credit for L-3 if it gets reenacted, which we expect will happen at some point. It may not happen in 2015, but we expect to have an R&E credit in the future. In any event, if it does get reenacted, it lowers our tax rate by about 220 basis points and would increase our EPS by about $0.24.
We continue to expect to generate free cash flow of about $925 million, and that's despite the MSI divestiture. So our free cash flow per share will exceed $11 per share in 2015, and that will provide a cash flow yield north of 9%.
With respect to our capital allocation, we are increasing our estimated share repurchases by $300 million to $800 million as I talked about for the MSI divestiture proceeds. And after we make those share repurchases and also pay our dividend, we expect that we'll end this year with about $750 million of cash, so we'll have flexibility for more capital deployment.
For the full year, we still expect a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.0x.
With respect to our second quarter outlook, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, margin in the high 8% range, EPS between $1.60 and $1.70, our free cash flow approximately between $100 million and $200 million and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x.
So to conclude my financial review, the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16. Although our first quarter was a slow start for the year, our order flow is improving and we expect our financial performance to improve sequentially, especially in the second half of this year. We continue to generate robust cash flow and we'll continue to allocate capital to increase shareholder value.
Thank you, and we'll now begin the Q&A."

And based upon those meetings and the way our company's results have been trending, and I'm talking about the credit ratios and credit metrics in this instance here. And they look at what we've been doing, and clearly we have employed a lot of debt in our capital structure, which, per our investment-grade credit ratings, are near or above the limit in terms of what the rating agencies like to see. And that's what's being reflected in their outlook changes from stable to negative. In both instances, end of February and just yesterday, S&P -- end of February was Moody's. They both reaffirmed our ratings and they're essentially telling us they want to see -- they don't want to see any further deterioration in the credit metrics and, in some cases, some improvement. So we're mindful of that. We think we have adequate cash flow and cash to continue to do what we're doing with the capital allocation in terms of the dividends and the share buybacks and also manage the credit ratings effectively.

The second way is that we expect that we're going to have natural organic improvement in our business the next year or so as we come out of the downturn, particularly with the DoD budgets. And lastly, we could also repay some debt. So we have the ability to use any of those items in order to manage the credit ratings, and that's how we're considering it."

We have the fact that the budget request is an improvement from where we've been and the fact that we see real growth starting in '16. Even with sequestration there, there's growth. So the trends are changing as we look out. So I don't think it will happen overnight, but it should gradually improve over the next 18 months is our view."

In fact, last year, we won virtually every recompete that we participated in. And they've done a very good job in the proposal process in winning business against bigger players -- that are, well, bigger players, period. And the performance or the contract execution has been very good. Their CPARS or their ratings have been outstanding. And the hesitancy on this side, which I'm sure you read, is that in the world that we're in where there seems to be a cyber element in everything, whether it's a Communication Systems contract or of course anything in the IT domain and many other places, could a diversified defense company -- would it be prudent to not have a cyber element within the company? So that's something that we are paying a lot of attention to. Since we do have some significant capability in that space, you just look at some of the recent wins that we've had with the NSA and other customers. They're well thought of and they do have unique offering with a very dedicated, skilled workforce. So I mean, they do well. Now I don't -- I've thought about it in terms of management, can we take more cost out? We really are running a lean operation and I attribute it more to the space that they're in and the dynamics in that space: more recompetitions; breaking contracts into smaller pieces; and the fact that there are just a lot of players there that are all scrapping for some top line growth and they are willing to bid lower and lower numbers, and Better Buying Power encourages that and the like. So it's a question of the space they're in right now. Now you could look at this as a cycle also, that this, too, will turn. Because I don't know that going to the lowest price bidder will save the day every time on the customer side. I think it'll probably be the most qualified bidder. And we've been trying to gradually move to higher-margin work. And when you say walk away, yes, we would walk away from work at 3% or 4%, 2% or 3% if we had to. But we'd like to still get in the DoD focus area of best value, which means putting out the best proposal, if you will, or the best quality at the best price. So there's still time to be played out here in terms of whether this trend will change and we could see some improvement in the margins. But having a flat top line or a shrinking top line and shrinking margins at the same time is not a type of business that we'd like to participate in. So if that continues, you could assume what our answer is going to be."

I recognize a few items that stand out in the quarter and we'll discuss those in detail. We are disappointed with the second quarter results, but we are actively working through them. And we're confident that we have the right strategy in place to drive continued value. 
There are a number of bright spots as well. Our fundamental growth drivers remain in place as we ended the quarter, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01 or $2.8 billion in funded orders, supporting the improvement we expect to see in the second half of this year. 
L-3 remains well-positioned. We are transforming our business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the defense electronics, communications, and ISR markets, where we have market-leading positions. We are intensely focused on capturing new opportunities and executing on our programs. We will accomplish this by investing in areas of the market that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow to support our growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders. We believe we have the right strategies in place to drive profitable growth and shareholder returns. We're also confident that we are near the end of the shrinking DoD budget environment and expect an inflection point starting next year. This will obviously support the growth of our business. 
Before I turn to our results, let me touch on an important step we are taking in our portfolio-shaping strategy. This morning, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our National Security Solutions business. Our strategy of building market-leading business positions in areas where we can generate higher margins and force-to-sales growth and return to shareholders remain a central theme for us at L-3. While NSS has performed well for their customers in this challenging environment, we believe that the improving DoD budget presents better capital deployment alternatives for us. The strategic review of NSS is well underway and we expect to make further announcements of the appropriate time. 
Turning to our Aerospace Systems business. We continue to have challenges with our 3 head-of-state aircraft programs, resulting in additional cost growth of approximately $84 million. As we stated last quarter, there is risk remaining on the contracts, and during the second quarter, we experienced new challenges that impacted the scheduled and increased our estimated cost to complete the work. We have addressed leadership and program management and continue to work with our customers to deliver the aircraft. We've made a number of site visits to the facility and are dedicating significant attention and our best resources to these programs. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet personally with one of our customers to assure them of our focus and update them on our work. Bottom line, this is a complex program. We have more to do, but we have our arms around the issue and are taking the necessary steps to droughts that. Ralph will discuss the second quarter charges related to these issues in more detail later. 
Turning to our second quarter results. We had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of about 7% compared with 2014 second quarter. During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $227 million. This is a decrease from the second quarter of 2014, where we generated $277 million in net cash. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.8 billion, which is about a 14% decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $10 billion of funded backlog. 
As I will discuss later, our mission integration division within Aerospace Systems continued building on its strong track record of excellence program performance. During the second quarter, we delivered large complex ISR aircraft on budget and ahead of schedule for DoD and international customers. From a business renovation standpoint, we secured key contracts across all of our segments, making good progress, repositioning our portfolio and achieving efficiencies in our business units. 
As evidence of our disciplined portfolio-shaping strategy, we recently announced that we expanded our commercial aviation training solutions business through the acquisition of CTC Aviation Group. This acquisition, which is immediately accretive to our operating results, fits squarely within our strategy to expand our international and commercial presence in key markets by focusing on higher-margin businesses with #1 and #2 positions and with the strongest prospects for future growth. So I can say for this particular acquisition, the margins are expected to be about double the margins of the entire Electronic Systems group. So we're very pleased with the prospects for CTC and it's an excellent fit for us. 
In addition, our CTC acquisition extends our commercial aviation business and allows L-3 to offer enhanced worldwide capabilities through a broader portfolio of training devices and delivery systems as well as scalable training solutions. This represents an important growth opportunity for us, given the well-recognized shortage of new commercial airline pilots around the globe. 
We also completed the divestiture of our MSI business during the quarter, which will result in improved margins and free up capital to be reinvested in higher growth, higher margin opportunities. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions and portfolio-shaping opportunities. As always, our goal is to complement L-3's existing businesses with new acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We are actively looking at businesses that will meet these criteria. We're also continuing to invest in our core businesses as well as developing promising technologies that fit our customers' evolving requirements and enable all 3 [ph] to penetrate new market and upgrade our product offerings. By doing so, we will leverage our strong cash flow, including returning more capital to our shareholders. 
We are increasing our strategic investments in defense electronics, simulators and training as well as solutions to carry the ever-increasing anti-access denial threats from near-peer adversaries. We are focusing resources to be consistent with the third [ph] offset strategy and Secretary Kendell's long-range R&D planning program. We expect that IRAD will represent close to 2.5% of our 2015 revenue, reflecting our commitment to investment in areas related to our core businesses. 
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results, particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers and pursuing new business opportunities. Along those lines, L-3 has been partnering and collaborating with other innovative private-sector technology companies in order to provide the war fighter with the latest technology, system that can be trusted and are effective in a wide range of operational context with the ability to respond to changing conditions. And given the global threat environment, what we're seeing is reconfigurable systems to win the day, and that's where we are focusing. 
I'd now like to make some brief comments on each of our business segments and touch on some important awards and milestones. In Electronic Systems, our largest segment, we make progress in securing the business that continue to get international and commercial market share. A great win for us in this space was the competitive awards for the delivery of 3 A320 simulators and 1 787 simulator for Hainan Airlines in China. We also received a 5-year contract to deliver Block 4 [ph] low-profile photonics mast for Virginia class subs. This key win helps L-3 maintain its position as the supplier of this critical technology and create additional opportunities to work with Allied navies. 
Additionally, we had a strategic win to supply a chipset and circuit breaker for a naval customer in the Republic of Korea. We are also awarded a contract to provide integrated platform management systems to frigits in the Taiwanese Navy. Lastly, sales of WESCAM turrets remain robust, with new orders for the MX 10 units from the U.S. Army, Airbus and the Royal Saudi airports. Overall, we're pleased with the performance of the segment and continue to make progress improving the margin profile. 
In the Aerospace Systems segment, I have high confidence in our team and expect we will see improving performance and execution in this segment going forward. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we recently received a contract extension for the U.S. Army on the C-12 program. This extension becomes effective August 1 and has new terms that are profitable for L-3. 
We also received additional funding for a number of programs, including the Gorgon Stair program, the Spider program in Saudi Arabia and the C27J program in Australia. Will remain focused on improving performance in these segments, delivering for our customers and increasing market share and core margins across the business. 
In our Communication Systems segment, had a strong quarter and are continuing to work on both margin improvement and technology development. We have a solid domestic military business and received continued funding for legacy DoD programs, including Hawklink, Wintee, ROVER and Global Hawk. And we also received a new contract on a cyber program for the Army Intelligence Center of Excellence. 
In the space domain, we secured a contract to supply the Traveling Wave Tubes on the amaranth seeker through 2018. As we have noted in the past, L-3 is 1 of only 2 global suppliers capable of performing this work. 
We also received an award to developing a new SATCOM modem for the E 4 B aircraft. This will be another critical piece of L-3's offering in the senior leader continuity of Government the mitigation suit for the DoD. 
And our International business is expanding in this segment, with Australia as a key market. We're doing advanced communications work on 2 key naval programs that create the opportunity for L-3 to become the maritime integrator Communication Systems provider of choice for this customer. The recent expansion of our SATCOM business in Australia establishes L-3, as the leading supplier of Manpack through 2.4-meters-size SATCOM terminals for the Ministry of Defence Wideband Global SATCOM or WGS Communication System. 
In Canada, to made initial penetration into a large potential maritime market to provide communications for 6 Arctic Offshore Patrol ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. Within the National Security Solutions segment, results were primarily impacted by the continued delay of some international contract awards. That said, NSS has a well-established reputation for performance through decades of serving customers successfully. We had some notable contract wins in NSS during the quarter, including the Royal Saudi Air Force air operations center training contract. This contract represents the foreign military sales, ID/IQ opportunity under, which L-3 will provide air operations in the training to personnel in Saudi Arabia for a 5-year performance period. We also want an international biometric contract. Finally, we received notice that a protest of the JIOC test program was resolved in our favor. 
Shifting gears, let me update you on our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to see increasing momentum in the second half of the year. We continue to operate in a challenging macro environment related to budget uncertainties, which impacts our business. However, we're seeing clear signs that the downturn is approaching bottom and the DoD budget is either stabilizing or an upswing. In fact, we anticipate an acceleration in the contracting environment at the government fiscal year closes. 
Regardless of the industry dynamics, we are committed to delivering value to the shareholders and to deploying capital in that the contribute that goal. Share repurchases and dividends continue to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy, and during the quarter, we returned almost $300 million to our shareholders. $246 million of it was in the form of common stock repurchases with a balance in dividends. As always, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. We're looking for ways to expand our international and commercial footprint as well as our DoD business to capitalize on the expected uptick in the defense budget. Taken together, this will provide even better value to our customers by offering a broader range of innovative products. This improving environment is creating opportunities to redeploy capital into higher value-added areas. The sale of MSI, along with acquisition of CDC, are an example of this strategy. Likewise, our evaluation of strategic alternatives for NSS is another effort. this will further strengthen our core business, improve our margin and sales growth profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company. We will make further announcements regarding the NSS process at the appropriate time. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph to review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions"

I'll discuss in details about the second quarter results, including the unusual chargers, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we have several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quickly cover a few of them. First, we had another solid quarterly book-to-bill ratio setting us up for the second half to return to profitable organic top line growth. Secondly, we had improving topline and healthy core margin performance in Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and the ISR system segment and Aerospace Systems segment, which comprise the businesses where we want to intend -- where we intend to prospectively focused the portfolio. And third, we generated a robust cash flow $183 million the second quarter. 
That said, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 with the operating margin at 5.9% for the second quarter. And second quarter sales operating income margin and EPS were below what we expected because of the $103 million of charges at the Platform Integration division and Aerospace Systems segment, which lowered EPS by $0.77. 
Income tax gains totaling $0.43 [ph] of EPS partially offset those charges. These items together caused the net reduction of $0.34 to EPS and 350 basis points operating margin. The contract charges of Platform Integration division primarily relate to the additional process of $84 million on a head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
When we report our first quarter results, we were expecting to deliver 1 aircraft at the end of June and the next by the end of December. And at that time, we explained that until we deliver those aircraft, we have lingering inherent risks. During the second quarter, we completed certain ground and flight tests. Customer inspections of the first 2 aircraft, which revealed significant additional more rework. And on the third aircraft, we completed a series of design reviews. 
Consequently, the delivery dates for each aircraft has slipped an average of 10 months and the estimated cost to complete those 3 [ph] contracts have increased by $84 million in the aggregate. 
To be clear, we're really disappointed by the size of the additional cost growth charges on the head-of-state contracts. However, the head of state contract performance problems a transitory. We will eventually the lease the interior modifications and deliver those aircraft and they will be high-quality aircraft. More importantly, while the second quarter charges are very painful, they will not continue to disrupt the company's financial performance because head-of-state aircraft modifications comprise a very small, sporadic part of our business base. To provide you some more context, the head-of-state modifications contracts usually have cell prices of about $150 million per contract with periods of performance of about 4 years. It is not steady, recurring, annual business. Procurement cycles are usually 10 years or longer, thus, head-of-state modifications comprise less than 1% of our annual consolidated sales. 
Moving onto second quarter segment results. Sales and operating margin for the Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were ahead of our expectations, and Aerospace Systems would've also exceeded our expectations if it were not for the Platform Integration division charges. The NSS segment performance continued to lag our estimates for the second quarter. At Electronic Systems, organic sales growth was minus 1% with solid operating margin of 11.5%. Favorable sales mix due mostly to more commercial aviation product sales largely offset unusual charges of $14 million in that segment. We incurred an incremental charge of $18 million in anticipation of a settlement for a product specifications matter with the government pertaining to our KEO tech holographic weapon sights. And at the end of June, we received an adverse arbitration ruling of $6 million stemming from a dispute with a nonperforming supplier that we terminated back in 2011. 
For Aerospace Systems segment, excluding the $103 million of contract cost growth charges and platform integration, operating margin would've been about 8% driven, by continued strong program performance at ISR Systems sector, where the margins exceed 10%. 
At Communication Systems segment, top line pressures began to abate toward the second quarter, with sales only supplying about 4%, and operating margin was a very healthy 10.4%, tracking higher than our full year estimates. We have better margin performance in both broadband, communications and advanced communications. And at NSS, sales and margins were, again, lower than what we expected due to continued delays and putting of select high-margin international and commercial work, which had similarly impacted the first quarter results. Encouragingly, we put some of those new contracts in late June and July, but these awards were not soon enough to benefit the second quarter. 
To this point, NSS had another strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.21 for the second quarter, supporting the sequential sales growth of the expect to realize in the second half of this year. 
With respect to the guidance update for 2015, substantially all the changes relate to the second quarter contract cost growth charges at Platform Integration, mostly in the head-of-state contract and related tax gains in the quarter. We lowered our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.65 [ph] or $0.09 to a new midpoint of $6.85. And with respect to sales, we maintained the guidance range of $11.450 [ph] billion to $11.650 [ph] billion, which now includes an increase of $50 million in Electronic Systems for the CTC Aviation Group acquisition that we completed on May 27, it also includes a $50 million sales decrease at Aerospace Systems due mostly to the head-of-state contracts adjustments. 
If you pro forma the MSI divestiture, our full year consolidated sales are expected to decline about 2%. And adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic sales versus 2014.  
In term of our segment guidance update, other than the Aerospace Systems adjustments, there are no other major changes or items that require explanation, so I'll leave those for the Q&A if you have any questions on those. I will say that regarding NSS segment guidance, we still expect sales and margin to increase in the second half of the year. And there is risk that are related to some of that high-margin international commercial orders, which we expect to add about $60 million of sales and 170 basis points to operating margin for the year in this segment. The remaining increases in the second half of this year versus the first half of NSS pertain to sales volumes of about $80 [ph] million in new program ramp ups, for which the contracts are in backlog, and higher award fees, each of which will add about 40 basis points of the NSS margins. 
With respect to free cash flow, we lowered our estimate for the year by $75 million to $850 [ph] million, primarily due to the head-of-state contract issues. In addition to estimated cash outlays of about $40 million for the cost growth charges that we'll incur in the second half of this year on those programs, we had about $50 million of cash collections that were tied to the delivering the first 2 aircraft this year, and those collections are slipped to 2016 and 2017. We expect our free cash flow to return to over $900 million in 2016. 
With respect to our capital allocation, we are still assuming $800 [ph] million of share repurchases for the year. During the first half, we repurchased $346 [ph] million, leaving about $450 million for the second half of this year. 
We are now planning to repay about $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter and that is because we are committed to preserving our investment-grade credit ratings. We still expect a full year book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0. 
So I'd like to conclude my financial comments by summarizing with the fact that the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16, which begins in a few months from now. Although our first half results were disappointing, order flow is solid and encouraging and we had several bright spots in our key business areas. We expect our financial performance to improve significantly the second half of this year, and we'll continue to generate robust cash flow and effectively allocate capital to increase shareholder value. Thank you. 
We'll now begin the Q&A."

So you're asking the question, yet the question was what are the normalized margins? So again, about 9%. And I want to pause the segment for you because I made some comments about a couple of the sectors. So a little more than half of the Aerospace Systems is ISR Systems, which is our strongest business in that segment. In fact, a very strong business in general. The margins, they are very healthy, and I said that the exceed 10%. Logistics Solutions is about $1.2 billion in sales this year, and that is a business that we're still in the process of rebuilding and strengthening, if you will. And Mike talked about the new army C 12 [ph] contract that begins in a couple of days from now that will become a profitable -- will be a profitable job compared to the previous army C 12 work that we've done over the last several years. So that's a big step towards improving adjusted solutions. But Logistic Solutions, margins on a normalized basis, on the of 4% to 5% range. And then lastly, platform systems, which we now call Aircraft Systems, which includes the Platform Integration business, that's the remaining sector in the segment, which is about $800 million of sales. And the margins there are normalized basis, should be in the high single-digits range. They are nowhere near that right now because of the problems that we've had in head-of-state, but that's what they're going to head back towards."

So, Cai, so management changes that we talked about that we made at the Platform Integration division, including the President and many of the senior leadership positions as well as program management, head-of-state contracts, those changes were made in the middle of April, around April 20. And those folks, together with us, has been addressing these contract PACs since then. As Mike said, we also changed the Aerospace Systems segment President early in June, and we did a press release on that in June 3. So the second question you asked was what's happening with the delivery dates on the 3 contracts? And in my prepared comments, I explained that on average, the delivery dates are slipping by about 10 months for each of the 3 contracts. Aside from that, I don't want to get into the particular dates for each  of the 3 contracts, but I will tell you that we're not going to deliver any of those aircraft this year, and the deliveries will be made in 2016 and 2017. In terms of key performance milestones that need to occur between now and then, there are a series of them and may pertain to items, including a variety of flight test with and without the customers present, obtaining FAA certifications for each of the aircraft, and then going through some customer training periods on each of the 3 aircrafts. But those performance milestones here started over the next year or 2, and they happen on appropriate times on each of the 3 contracts. So clearly, we're very close on the first aircraft, I say about halfway there on the second one and you may recall that in the third aircraft, I explained that we're going to proceed that aircraft next month. So that's clearly mostly in front of us right now. We did some very detailed reviews during the quarter, which we do in every quarter for that matter, and we factored in the experiences that we had in the second quarter on those contracts when we developed the estimates. And on the first aircraft, we experienced and incurred a lot of good work issues, and we're taking that experience and make changes to make sure that we don't repeat that on the second 2 aircraft. So we will have our arms around all 3 contracts. Did I answer your questions, Cai?"

Although SPYDR was designed to be an export product, it does have differences from the performance parameters that project Liberty had that renewed interest in the U.S. government on it, on the platform. And particularly, the potential to augment what they already have. Again, it'll be driven by requirements and things, but it's a highly capable, highly versatile aircraft. And as I said during my presentation, reconfigurable seems to rule the day in today's world. If you're operating in very different theaters with very different requirements, you're looking for different types of signals, you're dealing with different terrain. We make these aircraft highly reconfigurable in the field so you don't need a fleet of different aircraft to do different missions there. Very, very versatile, and that has gotten a lot of attention. And I think the U.S. government interest on it as something beyond what we thought about when we initially invested in this platform because it was really an export product. So we're happy to sell it domestically. 
Okay. Thank you. In conclusion, I'd like to spend just a moment or 2 talking about L-3 strategy and why we believe we're well-positioned to grow. Our global footprint expand our market share and enhance our long-term shareholder value. At its core, our strategy is very straightforward. We're focused on performance in capturing new opportunities. We are transforming the business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the markets, where we do best and have leading positions. Lastly, we are focused on leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in areas critical to the future of our business. Most importantly, we continue to return capital to shareholders. 
In the second quarter, we returned approximately $300 million between repurchases and dividends, and we'll continue to utilize that strategy to drive value. Again, the performance in Aerospace was a big disappointment, but we will get the audit and turn the corner, and I'm confident we have the right people on the job and we have a lot of good things to look forward to at L-3, including the portfolio sharpening that's well underway. So with that, thank you for joining us. I hope everyone has a nice remainder of the summer, and we will look forward to speaking with you again in the fall in October. So thank you."

I recognize that there are items that stand out in the quarter, and we'll discuss those in detail. We are disappointed with the second quarter results, but we are actively working through them. And we're confident that we have the right strategy in place to drive continued value. 
There are a number of bright spots as well. Our fundamental growth drivers remain in place as we ended the quarter, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01x or $2.8 billion in funded orders, supporting the improvement we expect to see in the second half of this year. 
L-3 remains well positioned. We are transforming our business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the defense electronics, communications and ISR markets, where we have market-leading positions. We are intensely focused on capturing new opportunities and executing on our programs. We will accomplish this by investing in areas of the market that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow to support our growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders. We believe we have the right strategies in place to drive profitable growth and shareholder returns. We're also confident that we are near the end of the shrinking DoD budget environment and expect an inflection point starting next year. This will obviously support the growth of our business. 
Before I turn to our results, let me touch on an important step we are taking in our portfolio-shaping strategy. This morning, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our National Security Solutions business. Our strategy of building market-leading business positions in areas where we can generate higher margins, enforce the sales growth and returns to shareholders remain a central theme for us at L-3. While NSS has performed well for their customers in this challenging environment, we believe that the improving DoD budget presents better capital deployment alternatives for us. The strategic review of NSS is well under way and we expect to make further announcements at the appropriate time. 
Turning to our Aerospace Systems business. We continue to have challenges with our 3 head-of-state aircraft programs, resulting in additional cost growth of approximately $84 million. As we've stated last quarter, there is risk remaining on the contracts, and during the second quarter, we experienced new challenges that impacted the schedule and increased our estimated cost to complete the work. We have addressed leadership and program management and continue to work with our customers to deliver the aircraft. We've made a number of site visits to the facility and are dedicating significant attention and our best resources to these programs. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet personally with one of our customers to assure them of our focus and update them on our work. Bottom line, this is a complex program. We have more to do, but we have our arms around the issues and are taking the necessary steps to address them. Ralph will discuss the second quarter charges relating to these issues in more detail later. 
Turning to our second quarter results. We had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of about 7% compared with 2014 second quarter. During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $227 million. This is a decrease from the second quarter of 2014, where we generated $277 million in net cash. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.8 billion, which is about a 14% decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $10 billion of funded backlog. 
As I will discuss later, our mission integration division within Aerospace Systems continued building on its strong track record of excellent program performance. During the second quarter, we delivered large complex ISR aircraft on budget and ahead of schedule for DoD and international customers. From a business generation standpoint, we secured key contracts across all of our segments, making continued progress repositioning our portfolio and achieving efficiencies in our business units. 
As evidence of our disciplined portfolio-shaping strategy, we recently announced that we expanded our commercial aviation training solutions business through the acquisition of CTC Aviation Group. This acquisition, which is immediately accretive to our operating results, fits squarely within our strategy to expand our international and commercial presence in key markets by focusing on higher-margin businesses with #1 and #2 positions and with the strongest prospects for future growth. So I can say for this particular acquisition, the margins are expected to be about double the margins of the entire Electronic Systems group. So we're very pleased with the prospects for CTC, and it's an excellent fit for us. 
In addition, our CTC acquisition extends our commercial aviation business and allows L-3 to offer enhanced worldwide capabilities through a broader portfolio of training devices and delivery systems as well as scalable training solutions. This represents an important growth opportunity for us, given the well-recognized shortage of new commercial airline pilots around the globe. 
We also completed the divestiture of our MSI business during the quarter, which will result in improved margins and free up capital to be reinvested in higher growth, higher-margin opportunities. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition and portfolio-shaping opportunities. As always, our goal is to complement L-3's existing businesses with new acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We are actively looking at businesses that will meet these criteria. We're also continuing to invest in our core businesses as well as developing promising technologies that fit our customers' evolving requirements and enable L-3 to penetrate new markets and upgrade our product offerings. By doing so, we will leverage our strong cash flow, including returning more capital to our shareholders. 
We are increasing our strategic investments in defense electronics, simulators and training as well as solutions to power the ever-increasing anti-access area denial threats from near-peer adversaries. We are focusing resources to be consistent with the third offset strategy and Secretary Kendall's long-range R&D planning program. We expect that IRAD will represent close to 2.5% of our 2015 revenue, reflecting our commitment to investment in areas related to our core businesses. 
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results, particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers and pursuing new business opportunities. Along those lines, L-3 has been partnering and collaborating with other innovative private-sector technology companies in order to provide the warfighter with the latest technology, systems that can be trusted and are effective in a wide range of operational context with the ability to respond to changing conditions. And given the global threat environment, what we're seeing is reconfigurable systems win the day, and that's where we are focusing. 
I'd now like to make some brief comments on each of our business segments and touch on some important awards and milestones. In Electronic Systems, our largest segment, we made progress in securing new business that continue to gain international and commercial market share. A great win for us in this space was the competitive award for the delivery of 3 A320 simulators and 1 787 simulator for Hainan Airlines in China. We also received a 5-year contract to deliver Block 4 Low Profile Photonics Masts for Virginia class subs. This key win helps L-3 maintain its position as the supplier of this critical technology and creates additional opportunities to work with allied navies. 
Additionally, we had a strategic win to supply a chipset and circuit breaker for a naval customer in the Republic of Korea. We were also awarded a contract to provide integrated platform management systems to frigates in the Taiwanese Navy. Lastly, sales of WESCAM turrets remain robust, with new orders for the MX-10 units from the U.S. Army, Airbus and the Royal Saudi Air Force. Overall, we're pleased with the performance of the segment and continue to make progress improving our margin profile. 
In the Aerospace Systems segment, I have high confidence in our team and expect we will see improving performance and execution in this segment going forward. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we recently received a contract extension from the U.S. Army on the C-12 program. This extension becomes effective August 1 and has new terms that are profitable for L-3. 
We also received additional funding for a number of programs, including the Gorgon Stare program, the SPYDR program in Saudi Arabia and the C-27J program in Australia. We will remain focused on improving performance in this segment, delivering for our customers an increasing market share and core margins across the business. 
In our Communication Systems segment, we had a strong quarter and are continuing to work on both margin improvement and technology development. We have a solid domestic military business and received continued funding for legacy DoD programs, including Hawklink, WIN-T, ROVER and Global Hawk. And we also received a new contract on a cyber program for the Army Intelligence Center of Excellence. 
In the space domain, we secured a contract to supply the Traveling Wave Tubes on the AMRAAM seeker through 2018. As we have noted in the past, L-3 is 1 of only 2 global suppliers capable of performing this work. 
We also received an award to develop a new SATCOM modem for the E-4B aircraft. This will be another critical piece of L-3's offering in the senior leader continuity of government communication suite for the DoD. 
And our International business is expanding in this segment, with Australia as a key market. We're doing advanced communications work on 2 key naval programs that create the opportunity for L-3 to become the maritime integrated communication systems provider of choice for this customer. The recent expansion of our SATCOM business in Australia establishes L-3 as the leading supplier of Manpack through 2.4-meter-sized SATCOM terminals for the Ministry of Defence's Wideband Global SATCOM or WGS communication system. In Canada, we made initial penetration into a large potential maritime market to provide communications for 6 Arctic/Offshore Patrol Ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. 
Within the National Security Solutions segment, results were primarily impacted by the continued delay of some international contract awards. That said, NSS has a well-established reputation for performance through decades of serving customers successfully. We had some notable contract wins in NSS during the quarter, including the Royal Saudi Air Force air operations center training contract. This contract represents a foreign military sales ID/IQ opportunity, under which L-3 will provide air operations and training to personnel in Saudi Arabia for a 5-year performance period. We also won an international biometric contract. Finally, we received notice that a protest of the JIOC TAAS program was resolved in our favor. 
Shifting gears, let me update you on our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to see increasing momentum in the second half of the year. We continue to operate in a challenging macro environment related to budget uncertainties, which impacts our business. However, we're seeing clear signs that the downturn is approaching bottom and the DoD budget is either stabilizing or at an upswing. In fact, we anticipate an acceleration in the contracting environment as the government fiscal year closes. 
Regardless of the industry dynamics, we are committed to delivering value to the shareholders and to deploying capital in ways that contribute to that goal. Share repurchases and dividends continued to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy, and during the quarter, we returned almost $300 million to our shareholders. $246 million of it was in the form of common stock repurchases, with the balance in dividends. 
As always, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. We're looking for ways to expand our international and commercial footprint as well as our DoD business to capitalize on the expected uptick in the defense budget. Taken together, this will provide even better value to our customers by offering a broader range of innovative products. This improving environment is creating opportunities to redeploy capital into higher value-added areas. The sale of MSI, along with the acquisition of CTC, are an example of this strategy. Likewise, our evaluation of strategic alternatives for NSS is another effort. This will further strengthen our core business, improve our margin and sales growth profile and generate strong cash flow for the company. We will make further announcements regarding the NSS process at the appropriate time. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph to review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."
93538,307196008,843072,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results, including the unusual charges, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we had several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quick",1375,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results, including the unusual charges, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we had several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quickly cover a few of them. First, we had another solid quarterly book-to-bill ratio, setting us up for the second half to return to profitable organic top line growth. Secondly, we had improving top line and healthy core margin performance in Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and the ISR system sector and Aerospace Systems segment, which comprise the businesses where we want to intend -- where we intend to prospectively focus the portfolio. And third, we generated a robust cash flow of $183 million in the second quarter. 
That said, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41, with the operating margin at 5.9% for the second quarter. And second quarter sales, operating income, margin and EPS were below what we expected because of the $103 million of charges at the Platform Integration division in the Aerospace Systems segment, which lowered EPS by $0.77. 
Income tax gains totaling $0.43 of EPS partially offset those charges. These items together caused a net reduction of $0.34 to EPS and 350 basis points to operating margin. The contract charges of Platform Integration division primarily relate to the additional losses of $84 million on head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
When we reported our first quarter results, we were expecting to deliver 1 aircraft at the end of June and the next by the end of December. And at that time, we explained that until we deliver those aircraft, we have lingering inherent risks. During the second quarter, we completed certain ground and flight tests; customer inspections on the first 2 aircraft, which revealed significant additional and more extensive rework; and on the third aircraft, we completed a series of design reviews. 
Consequently, the delivery dates for each aircraft has slipped an average of 10 months and the estimated cost to complete those 3 contracts have increased by $84 million in the aggregate. 
To be clear, we're really disappointed by the size of the additional cost growth charges on the head-of-state contracts. However, the head-of-state contract performance problems are transitory. We will eventually complete the interior modifications and deliver those aircraft and they will be high-quality aircraft. More importantly, while the second quarter charges are very painful, they will not continue to disrupt the company's financial performance because head-of-state aircraft modifications comprise a very small, sporadic part of our business base. To provide you some more context, the head-of-state modifications contracts usually have sale prices of about $150 million per contract, with periods of performance of about 4 years. It is not steady, recurring, annual business. Procurement cycles are usually 10 years or longer, thus, head-of-state modifications comprise less than 1% of our annual consolidated sales. 
Moving on to second quarter segment results. Sales and operating margin for the Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were ahead of our expectations. And Aerospace Systems would've also exceeded our expectations if it were not for the Platform Integration division charges. The NSS segment performance continued to lag our estimates for the second quarter. At Electronic Systems, organic sales growth was minus 1%, with solid operating margin of 11.5%. Favorable sales mix due mostly to more commercial aviation product sales largely offset unusual charges of $14 million in that segment. We incurred an incremental charge of $8 million in anticipation of a settlement for a product specifications matter with the U.S. government pertaining to our KEO tech holographic weapon sights. And at the end of June, we received an adverse arbitration ruling of $6 million stemming from a dispute with a nonperforming supplier that we terminated back in 2011. 
For Aerospace Systems segment, excluding the $103 million of contract cost growth charges and platform integration, operating margin would've been about 8%, driven by continued strong program performance at ISR Systems sector, where the margins exceed 10%. 
At Communication Systems segment, top line pressures began to abate toward the second quarter, with sales only declining about 4%, and operating margin was a very healthy 10.4%, tracking higher than our full year estimates. We had better margin performance in both broadband communications and advanced communications. And at NSS, sales and margins were, again, lower than what we expected due to continued delays in booking of select high-margin international and commercial work, which had similarly impacted the first quarter results. Encouragingly, we booked some of those new contracts in late June and July, but these awards were not soon enough to benefit the second quarter. 
To this point, NSS had another strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.21x for the second quarter, supporting the sequential sales growth that we expect to realize there in the second half of this year. 
With respect to the guidance update for 2015, substantially all the changes relate to the second quarter contract cost growth charges at Platform Integration, mostly in the head-of-state contracts and the unrelated tax gains in the quarter. We lowered our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.65 -- or $0.09 to a new midpoint of $6.85. And with respect to sales, we maintained the guidance range of $11,450,000,000 to $11,650,000,000 which now includes an increase of $50 million at Electronic Systems for the CTC Aviation Group acquisition that we completed on May 27, and it also includes a $50 million sales decrease at Aerospace Systems due mostly to the head-of-state contract adjustments. 
If you pro forma the MSI divestiture, our full year consolidated sales are expected to decline about 2%. And adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic sales to decline about 3% versus 2014.  
In terms of our segment guidance update, other than the Aerospace Systems adjustments, there are no other major changes or items that require explanation, so I'll leave those for the Q&A to the extent that you have any questions on those. 
But I will say that regarding NSS segment guidance, we still expect sales and margin to increase in the second half of the year. And there is risk there related to some of that high-margin international commercial orders, which we expect to add about $60 million to sales and 170 basis points to operating margin for the year in this segment. The remaining increases in the second half of this year versus the first half of NSS pertain to sales volumes of about $80 million on new program ramp-ups, for which the contracts are in backlog, and higher award fees, each of which will add about 40 basis points to full year NSS margin. 
With respect to free cash flow, we lowered our estimate for the year by $75 million to $850 million, primarily due to the head-of-state contract issues. In addition to estimated cash outlays of about $40 million for the cost growth charges that we'll incur in the second half of this year on those programs, we had about $50 million of cash collections that were tied to delivering the first 2 aircraft this year, and those collections have slipped to 2016 and 2017. We expect our free cash flow to return to over $900 million in 2016. 
With respect to our capital allocation, we are still assuming $800 million of share repurchases for the year. During the first half, we repurchased $346 million, leaving about $450 million for the second half of this year. 
We are now planning to repay about $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and that is because we are committed to preserving our investment-grade credit ratings. We still expect the full year book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0x. 
So I'd like to conclude my financial comments by summarizing with the fact that the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16, which begins in a few months from now. Although our first half results were disappointing, order flow is solid and encouraging and we had several bright spots in our key business areas. We expect our financial performance to improve significantly in the second half of this year, and we'll continue to generate robust cash flow and effectively allocate capital to increase shareholder value. Thank you. 
We'll now begin the Q&A."

So you asked about -- the question you asked -- the question was what are the normalized margins? So they're about 9%. And I want to pause the segment for you because I made some comments about a couple of the sectors. So a little more than half of Aerospace Systems is ISR Systems, which is our strongest business in that segment. In fact, a very strong business in general. The margins, they are very healthy, and I said that they exceed 10%. Logistics Solutions is about $1.2 billion in sales this year, and that is a business that we're still in the process of rebuilding and strengthening, if you will. And Mike talked about the new army C-12 contract that begins in a couple of days from now. That will become a profitable -- will be a profitable job compared to the previous army C-12 work that we've done over the last several years. So that's a big step towards improving Logistics Solutions. But Logistics Solutions margins, on a normalized basis, are in the 4% to 5% range. And then lastly, Platform Systems, which we now call Aircraft Systems, which includes the Platform Integration business, that's the remaining sector in the segment, which is about $800 million of sales. And the margins there are, on a normalized basis, should be in the high single-digit range. They are nowhere near that right now because of the problems that we've had on head-of-state, but that's where they're going to head back towards."

As Mike said, we also changed the Aerospace Systems segment President early in June, and we did a press release on that on June 3. So the second question you asked was what's happening with the delivery dates on the 3 contracts? And in my prepared comments, I explained that, on average, the delivery dates are slipping by about 10 months for each of the 3 contracts. Aside from that, I don't want to get into the particular dates for each of the 3 contracts, but I will tell you that we're not going to be delivering any of those aircraft this year, and the deliveries will be made in 2016 and 2017. In terms of key performance milestones that need to occur between now and then, there are a series of them and may pertain to items, including a variety of flight test with and without the customers present, obtaining FAA certifications for each of the aircraft and then going through some customer training periods on each of the 3 aircraft. But those performance milestones are staggered over the next year or 2, and they happen on appropriate times on each of the 3 contracts. So clearly, we're very close on the first aircraft. I'd say about halfway there on the second one. And you may recall that in the third aircraft, I explained that we're going to receive that aircraft next month. So that's clearly mostly in front of us right now. We did some very detailed reviews during the quarter, which we do in every quarter for that matter, and we factored in the experiences that we had in the second quarter on those contracts when we developed the estimates. And on the first aircraft, we've experienced and incurred a lot of rework issues. And we've taken that experience and we made changes to make sure we don't repeat that on the second 2 aircraft. So we will have our arms around all 3 contracts. Did I answer all your questions, Cai?"

I mean, although SPYDR was designed to be an export product, it does have differences from the performance parameters that Project liberty had, that renewed the interest in the U.S. government on it, on the platform. And particularly, the potential to augment what they already have. Again, it'll be driven by requirements and things, but it's a highly capable, highly versatile aircraft. And as I said during my presentation, reconfigurable seems to rule the day in today's world. If you're operating in very different theaters with very different requirements, you're looking for different types of signals, you're dealing with different terrain. We make these aircraft highly reconfigurable in the field so you don't need a fleet of different aircraft to do different missions. They're very, very versatile, and that has gotten a lot of attention. And I think the U.S. government interest on it is something beyond what we thought about when we initially invested in this platform because it was really an export product. So we're happy to sell it domestically. 
Okay. Well, thank you. In conclusion, I'd like to spend just a moment or 2 talking about L-3 strategy and why we believe we're well positioned to grow our global footprint, expand our market share and enhance our long-term shareholder value. At its core, our strategy is very straightforward. We're focused on performance in capturing new opportunities. We are transforming the business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the markets where we do best and have leading positions. Lastly, we are focused on leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in areas critical to the future of our business. Most importantly, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders. 
In the second quarter, we returned approximately $300 million between the repurchases and dividends, and we will continue to utilize that strategy to drive value. Again, the performance in Aerospace was a big disappointment, but we will get beyond it and turn the corner, and I'm confident we have the right people on the job and that we have a lot of good things to look forward to at L-3, including the portfolio sharpening that's well under way. 
So with that, thank you for joining us. I hope everyone has a nice remainder of the summer, and we will look forward to speaking with you again in the fall in October. So thank you."

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call. I recognize that there are items that stand out in the quarter, and we'll discuss those in detail.

I recognize that there are items that stand out in the quarter, and we'll discuss those in detail. We are disappointed with the second quarter results, but we are actively working through them. And we're confident that we have the right strategy in place to drive continued value. 
There are a number of bright spots as well. Our fundamental growth drivers remain in place as we ended the quarter, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01x or $2.8 billion in funded orders, supporting the improvement we expect to see in the second half of this year. 
L-3 remains well positioned. We are transforming our business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the defense electronics, communications and ISR markets, where we have market-leading positions. We are intensely focused on capturing new opportunities and executing on our programs. We will accomplish this by investing in areas of the market that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow to support our growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders. We believe we have the right strategies in place to drive profitable growth and shareholder returns. We're also confident that we are near the end of the shrinking DoD budget environment and expect an inflection point starting next year. This will obviously support the growth of our business. 
Before I turn to our results, let me touch on an important step we are taking in our portfolio-shaping strategy. This morning, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our National Security Solutions business. Our strategy of building market-leading business positions in areas where we can generate higher margins enforce the sales growth and returns to shareholders remains a central theme for us at L-3. While NSS has performed well for their customers in this challenging environment, we believe that the improving DoD budget presents better capital deployment alternatives for us. The strategic review of NSS is well under way and we expect to make further announcements at the appropriate time. 
Turning to our Aerospace Systems business. We continue to have challenges with our 3 head-of-state aircraft programs, resulting in additional cost growth of approximately $84 million. As we stated last quarter, there is risk remaining on the contracts, and during the second quarter, we experienced new challenges that impacted the schedule and increased our estimated cost to complete the work. We have addressed leadership and program management and continue to work with our customers to deliver the aircraft. We've made a number of site visits to the facility and are dedicating significant attention and our best resources to these programs. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet personally with one of our customers to assure them of our focus and update them on our work. Bottom line, this is a complex program. We have more to do, but we have our arms around the issues and are taking the necessary steps to address them. Ralph will discuss the second quarter charges relating to these issues in more detail later. 
Turning to our second quarter results. We had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of about 7% compared with the 2014 second quarter. During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $227 million. This is a decrease from the second quarter of 2014, when we generated $277 million in net cash. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.8 billion, which was about a 14% decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $10 billion of funded backlog. 
As I will discuss later, our mission integration division within Aerospace Systems continued building on its strong track record of excellent program performance. During the second quarter, we delivered large complex ISR aircraft on budget and ahead of schedule for DoD and international customers. From a business generation standpoint, we secured key contracts across all of our segments, making continued progress repositioning our portfolio and achieving efficiencies in our business units. 
As evidence of our disciplined portfolio-shaping strategy, we recently announced that we expanded our commercial aviation training solutions business through the acquisition of CTC Aviation Group. This acquisition, which is immediately accretive to our operating results, fits squarely within our strategy to expand our international and commercial presence in key markets by focusing on higher-margin businesses with #1 and #2 positions and with the strongest prospects for future growth. I can say for this particular acquisition, the margins are expected to be about double the margins of the entire Electronic Systems group. So we're very pleased with the prospects for CTC, and it's an excellent fit for us. 
In addition, our CTC acquisition extends our commercial aviation business and allows L-3 to offer enhanced worldwide capabilities through a broader portfolio of training devices and delivery systems as well as scalable training solutions. This represents an important growth opportunity for us, given the well-recognized shortage of new commercial airline pilots around the globe. 
We also completed the divestiture of our MSI business during the quarter, which will result in improved margins and free up capital to be reinvested in higher growth, higher-margin opportunities. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition and portfolio-shaping opportunities. As always, our goal is to complement L-3's existing businesses with new acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We are actively looking at businesses that will meet these criteria. We're also continuing to invest in our core businesses as well as developing promising technologies that fit our customers' evolving requirements and enable L-3 to penetrate new markets and upgrade our product offerings. By doing so, we will leverage our strong cash flow, including returning more capital to our shareholders. 
We are increasing our strategic investments in defense electronics, simulators and training as well as solutions to counter the ever-increasing anti-access area denial threats from near-peer adversaries. We are focusing resources to be consistent with the third offset strategy and Secretary Kendall's long-range R&D planning program. We expect that IRAD will represent close to 2.5% of our 2015 revenue, reflecting our commitment to investment in areas related to our core businesses. 
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results, particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers and pursuing new business opportunities. Along those lines, L-3 has been partnering and collaborating with other innovative private-sector technology companies in order to provide the warfighter with the latest technology, systems that can be trusted and are effective in a wide range of operational contexts with the ability to respond to changing conditions. And given the global threat environment, what we're seeing is reconfigurable systems win the day, and that's where we are focusing. 
I'd now like to make some brief comments on each of our business segments and touch on some important awards and milestones. In Electronic Systems, our largest segment, we made progress in securing new business and continued to gain international and commercial market share. A great win for us in this space was the competitive award for the delivery of 3 A320 simulators and 1 787 simulator for Hainan Airlines in China. We also received a 5-year contract to deliver Block 4 Low Profile Photonics Masts for Virginia-class subs. This key win helps L-3 maintain its position as the supplier of this critical technology and creates additional opportunities to work with allied navies. 
Additionally, we had a strategic win to supply a ship set and circuit breaker for a naval customer in the Republic of Korea. We were also awarded a contract to provide integrated platform management systems to frigates in the Taiwanese Navy. Lastly, sales of WESCAM turrets remain robust, with new orders for the MX-10 units from the U.S. Army, Airbus and the Royal Saudi Air Force. Overall, we're pleased with the performance of the segment and continue to make progress improving our margin profile. 
In the Aerospace Systems segment, I have high confidence in our team and expect we will see improving performance and execution in this segment going forward. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we recently received a contract extension from the U.S. Army on the C-12 program. This extension becomes effective August 1 and has new terms that are profitable for L-3. 
We also received additional funding for a number of programs, including the Gorgon Stare program, the SPYDR program in Saudi Arabia and the C-27J program in Australia. We will remain focused on improving performance in this segment, delivering for our customers an increasing market share and core margins across the business. 
In our Communication Systems segment, we had a strong quarter and are continuing to work on both margin improvement and technology development. We have a solid domestic military business and received continued funding for legacy DoD programs, including Hawklink, WIN-T, ROVER and Global Hawk. And we also received a new contract on a cyber program for the Army Intelligence Center of Excellence. 
In the space domain, we secured a contract to supply the Traveling Wave Tubes on the AMRAAM seeker through 2018. As we have noted in the past, L-3 is 1 of only 2 global suppliers capable of performing this work. 
We also received an award to develop a new SATCOM modem for the E-4B aircraft. This will be another critical piece of L-3's offering in the senior leader continuity of government communication suite for the DoD. 
And our International business is expanding in this segment, with Australia as a key market. We're doing advanced communications work on 2 key naval programs that creates the opportunity for L-3 to become the maritime integrated communication systems provider of choice for this customer. The recent expansion of our SATCOM business in Australia establishes L-3 as the leading supplier of Manpack through 2.4-meter-sized SATCOM terminals for the Ministry of Defence's Wideband Global SATCOM or WGS communication system. In Canada, we made initial penetration into a large potential maritime market to provide communications for 6 Arctic/Offshore Patrol Ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. 
Within the National Security Solutions segment, results were primarily impacted by the continued delay of some international contract awards. That said, NSS has a well-established reputation for performance through decades of serving customers successfully. We had some notable contract wins in NSS during the quarter, including the Royal Saudi Air Force air operations center training contract. This contract represents a foreign military sales ID/IQ opportunity, under which L-3 will provide air operations center and training to personnel in Saudi Arabia for a 5-year performance period. We also won an international biometric contract. Finally, we received notice that a protest of the JIOC TAAS program was resolved in our favor. 
Shifting gears, let me update you on our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to see increasing momentum in the second half of the year. We continue to operate in a challenging macro environment related to budget uncertainties, which impacts our business. However, we're seeing clear signs that the downturn is approaching bottom and the DoD budget is either stabilizing or on an upswing. In fact, we anticipate an acceleration in the contracting environment as the government fiscal year closes. 
Regardless of the industry dynamics, we are committed to delivering value to the shareholders and to deploying capital in ways that contribute to that goal. Share repurchases and dividends continued to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy, and during the quarter, we returned almost $300 million to our shareholders. $246 million of it was in the form of common stock repurchases, with the balance in dividends. 
As always, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. We're looking for ways to expand our international and commercial footprint as well as our DoD business to capitalize on the expected uptick in the defense budget. Taken together, this will provide even better value to our customers by offering a broader range of innovative products. This improving environment is creating opportunities to redeploy capital into higher value-added areas. The sale of MSI, along with the acquisition of CTC, are an example of this strategy. Likewise, our evaluation of strategic alternatives for NSS is another effort. This will further strengthen our core business, improve our margin and sales growth profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company. We will make further announcements regarding the NSS process at the appropriate time. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ralph to review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."
93538,307196008,843525,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results, including the unusual charges, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we had several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quick",1377,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results, including the unusual charges, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we had several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quickly cover a few of them. First, we had another solid quarterly book-to-bill ratio, setting us up for the second half to return to profitable organic top line growth. Secondly, we had improving top line and healthy core margin performance in Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and the ISR system sector and Aerospace Systems segment, which comprised of businesses where we want to intend -- where we intend to prospectively focus the portfolio. And third, we generated a robust cash flow of $183 million in the second quarter. 
That said, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41, with the operating margin of 5.9% for the second quarter. And second quarter sales, operating income, margin and EPS were below what we expected because of the $103 million of charges at the Platform Integration division in the Aerospace Systems segment, which lowered EPS by $0.77. 
Income tax gains totaling $0.43 of EPS partially offset those charges. These items together caused a net reduction of $0.34 to EPS and 350 basis points to operating margin. The contract charges of Platform Integration division primarily relate to the additional losses of $84 million on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
When we reported our first quarter results, we were expecting to deliver 1 aircraft at the end of June and the next by the end of December. And at that time, we explained that until we deliver those aircraft, we have lingering inherent risks. During the second quarter, we completed certain ground and flight tests; customer inspections on the first 2 aircraft, which revealed significant additional and more extensive rework; and on the third aircraft, we completed a series of design reviews. 
Consequently, the delivery dates for each aircraft have slipped an average of 10 months and the estimated cost to complete those 3 contracts have increased by $84 million in the aggregate. 
To be clear, we're really disappointed by the size of the additional cost growth charges on the head-of-state contracts. However, the head-of-state contract performance problems are transitory. We will eventually complete the interior modifications and deliver those aircraft and they will be high-quality aircraft. More importantly, while the second quarter charges are very painful, they will not continue to disrupt the company's financial performance because head-of-state aircraft modifications comprised a very small, sporadic part of our business base. To provide you some more context, the head-of-state modifications contracts usually have sale prices of about $150 million per contract, with periods of performance of about 4 years. It is not steady, recurring, annual business. Procurement cycles are usually 10 years or longer, thus, head-of-state modifications comprise less than 1% of our annual consolidated sales. 
Moving on to second quarter segment results. Sales and operating margin for the Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were ahead of our expectations. And Aerospace Systems would've also exceeded our expectations if it were not for the Platform Integration division charges. The NSS segment performance continued to lag our estimates for the second quarter. At Electronic Systems, organic sales growth was minus 1%, with solid operating margin of 11.5%. Favorable sales mix due mostly to more commercial aviation product sales largely offset unusual charges of $14 million in that segment. We incurred an incremental charge of $8 million in anticipation of a settlement for a product specifications matter with the U.S. government pertaining to our EOTech holographic weapon sights. And at the end of June, we received an adverse arbitration ruling of $6 million stemming from a dispute with a nonperforming supplier that we terminated back in 2011. 
For Aerospace Systems segment, excluding the $103 million of contract cost growth charges and platform integration, operating margin would've been about 8%, driven by continued strong program performance at ISR Systems sector, where the margins exceed 10%. 
At Communication Systems segment, top line pressures began to abate toward the second quarter, with sales only declining about 4%, and operating margin was a very healthy 10.4%, tracking higher than our full year estimates. We had better margin performance in both broadband communications and advanced communications. And at NSS, sales and margins were, again, lower than what we expected due to continued delays in booking of select high-margin international and commercial work, which had similarly impacted the first quarter results. Encouragingly, we booked some of those new contracts in late June and in July, but these awards were not soon enough to benefit the second quarter. 
To this point, NSS had another strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.21x for the second quarter, supporting the sequential sales growth that we expect to realize there in the second half of this year. 
With respect to the guidance update for 2015, substantially all the changes relate to the second quarter contract cost growth charges at Platform Integration, mostly in the head-of-state contracts and the unrelated tax gains in the quarter. We lowered our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.65 -- or $0.09 to a new midpoint of $6.85. And with respect to sales, we maintained the guidance range of $11,450,000,000 to $11,650,000,000, which now includes an increase of $50 million at Electronic Systems for the CTC Aviation Group acquisition that we completed on May 27, and it also includes a $50 million sales decrease at Aerospace Systems due mostly to the head-of-state contract adjustments. 
If you pro forma the MSI divestiture, our full year consolidated sales are expected to decline about 2%. And adjusting for all acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic sales to decline about 3% versus 2014.  
In terms of our segment guidance update, other than the Aerospace Systems adjustments, there are no other major changes or items that require explanation, so I'll leave those for the Q&A to the extent that you have any questions on those. 
But I will say that regarding NSS segment guidance, we still expect sales and margin to increase in the second half of the year. And there is risk there related to some of that high-margin international commercial orders, which we expect to add about $60 million to sales and 170 basis points to operating margin for the year in the segment. The remaining increases in the second half of this year versus the first half of NSS pertain to sales volumes of about $80 million and new program ramp-ups, for which the contracts are in backlog, and higher award fees, each of which will add about 40 basis points to full year NSS margin. 
With respect to free cash flow, we lowered our estimate for the year by $75 million to $850 million, primarily due to the head-of-state contract issues. In addition to estimated cash outlays of about $40 million for the cost growth charges that we'll incur in the second half of this year on those programs, we had about $50 million of cash collections that were tied to delivering the first 2 aircraft this year, and those collections have slipped to 2016 and 2017. We expect our free cash flow to return to over $900 million in 2016. 
With respect to our capital allocation, we are still assuming $800 million of share repurchases for the year. During the first half, we repurchased $346 million, leaving about $450 million for the second half of this year. 
We are now planning to repay about $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and that is because we are committed to preserving our investment-grade credit ratings. We still expect the full year book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0x. 
So I'd like to conclude my financial comments by summarizing with the fact that the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16, which begins in a few months from now. Although our first half results were disappointing, order flow was solid and encouraging and we had several bright spots in our key business areas. We expect our financial performance to improve significantly in the second half of this year, and we'll continue to generate robust cash flow and effectively allocate capital to increase shareholder value. Thank you. 
We'll now begin the Q&A."

This company has had a very strong track record. This year has gone a little bit awry. And I'm just wondering, when you look at the company's performance, particularly the shares over the past year, there's really a bit of a difference relative to peers. In thinking about what's happened to Aerospace Systems and NSS, is this a bunch of blocking and tackling on small things? Or are there some larger strategic fixes that you can apply?"

It's certainly very unlike L-3 to have a cost growth or an execution issue on a program like we're seeing. But I can assure you, we're very focused on it. Where necessary, we've changed the management. We, in general, and me in particular, have been at this business unit several times over the last month or so, have our arms around the issues and we're addressing them head on. I've spent last week doing a lot of traveling and visiting the customer in person just to make sure that we are communicating clearly as to how we're proceeding. And resolving this is going to be a bit of a matter of time, but we will resolve it. And there's a lot of great things happening around the company, and I don't want everybody to lose sight of that, including some very proactive portfolio shaping. At the end of the day, we expect to have a leaner, more profitable L-3 with a much better growth profile when we're done with the portfolio shaping, and we'll continue to be a market leader in our businesses that will be focused on defense electronics, our Communication Systems as well as ISR. So I think we have the right plan and we will execute it."

So Aerospace systems, if you look at our guidance update for the year, so it's a little more than $4 billion a year of sales this year, with margins that are now down to 5%. So you asked about question -- the question was, what are the normalized margins? So they're about 9%. And I want to pause the segment for you because I made some comments about a couple of the sectors. So a little more than half of Aerospace Systems is ISR Systems, which is our strongest business in that segment. In fact, a very strong business in general. The margins there are very healthy, and I said that they exceed 10%. Logistics Solutions is about $1.2 billion in sales this year, and that is a business that we're still in the process of rebuilding and strengthening, if you will. And Mike talked about the new army C-12 contract that begins in a couple of days from now. That will become a profitable -- will be a profitable job compared to the previous army C-12 work that we've done the last several years. So that's a big step towards improving Logistics Solutions. But Logistics Solutions margins, on a normalized basis, are in the 4% to 5% range. And then lastly, Platform Systems, which we now call Aircraft Systems, which includes the Platform Integration business, that's the remaining sector in the segment, which is about $800 million of sales. And the margins there are, on a normalized basis, should be in the high single-digit range. They are nowhere near that right now because of the problems that we've had on head-of-state, but that's where they're going to head back towards."

So Cai, so the management changes that we talked about that we made at the Platform Integration division, including the President and many of the senior leadership positions as well as program management on all 3 of the head-of-state contracts. Those changes were made in the middle of April, around April 20. And those folks, together with us, has been assessing these contract EACs since then. As Mike said, we also changed the Aerospace Systems segment President early in June, and we did a press release on that on June 3. So the second question you asked was what's happening with the delivery dates on the 3 contracts? And when I -- in my prepared comments, I explained that, on average, the delivery dates are slipping by about 10 months for each of the 3 contracts. Aside from that, I don't want to get into the particular dates for each of the 3 contracts, but I will tell you that we're not going to be delivering any of those aircraft this year, and the deliveries will be made in 2016 and 2017. In terms of key performance milestones that need to occur between now and then, there are a series of them and may pertain to items, including a variety of flight test with and without the customers present, obtaining FAA certifications for each of the aircraft and then going through some customer training periods on each of the 3 aircraft. Those performance milestones are staggered over the next year or 2, and they happen on appropriate times on each of the 3 contracts. So clearly, we're very close on the first aircraft. I'd say about halfway there on the second one. And you may recall that on the third aircraft, I explained that we're going to receive that aircraft next month. So that's clearly mostly in front of us right now. We did some very detailed reviews during the quarter, which we do in every quarter for that matter, and we factored in the experiences that we had in the second quarter on those contracts when we developed the estimates. And on the first aircraft, we've experienced and incurred a lot of rework issues. And we've taken that experience and we've made changes to make sure we don't repeat that on the second 2 aircraft. So we will -- we have our arms around all 3 contracts. Did I answer all your questions, Cai?"

I mean, although SPYDR was designed to be an export product, it does have differences from the performance parameters that Project Liberty had, that renewed the interest in the U.S. government on it, on the platform. And particularly, the potential to augment what they already have. Again, it'll be driven by requirements and things, but it's a highly capable, highly versatile aircraft. And as I said during my presentation, reconfigurable seems to rule the day in today's world. If you're operating in very different theaters with very different requirements, you're looking for different types of signals, you're dealing with different terrain. We make these aircraft highly reconfigurable in the field so you don't need a fleet of different aircraft to do different missions. They're very, very versatile, and that has gotten a lot of attention. And I think the U.S. government interest on it is something beyond what we thought about when we initially invested in this platform because it was really an export product. So we're happy to sell it domestically. 
Okay. Well, thank you. In conclusion, I'd like to spend just a moment or 2 talking about L-3's strategy and why we believe we're well positioned to grow our global footprint, expand our market share and enhance our long-term shareholder value. At its core, our strategy is very straightforward. We're focused on performance and capturing new opportunities. We are transforming the business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the markets where we do best and have leading positions. Lastly, we are focused on leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in areas critical to the future of our business. Most important, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders. 
In the second quarter, we returned approximately $300 million between the repurchases and dividends, and we will continue to utilize that strategy to drive value. Again, the performance in Aerospace was a big disappointment, but we will get beyond it and turn the corner, and I'm confident we have the right people on the job and that we have a lot of good things to look forward to at L-3, including the portfolio sharpening that's well under way. 
So with that, thank you for joining us. I hope everyone has a nice remainder of the summer, and we will look forward to speaking with you again in the fall in October. So thank you."

I recognize that there are items that stand out in the quarter, and we'll discuss those in detail. We are disappointed with the second quarter results, but we are actively working through them. And we're confident that we have the right strategy in place to drive continued value. 
There are a number of bright spots as well. Our fundamental growth drivers remain in place as we ended the quarter, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01x or $2.8 billion in funded orders, supporting the improvement we expect to see in the second half of this year. 
L-3 remains well positioned. We are transforming our business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the defense electronics, communications and ISR markets, where we have market-leading positions. We are intensely focused on capturing new opportunities and executing on our programs. We will accomplish this by investing in areas of the market that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow to support our growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders. We believe we have the right strategies in place to drive profitable growth and shareholder returns. We're also confident that we are near the end of the shrinking DoD budget environment and expect an inflection point starting next year. This will obviously support the growth of our business. 
Before I turn to our results, let me touch on an important step we are taking in our portfolio-shaping strategy. This morning, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our National Security Solutions business. Our strategy of building market-leading business positions in areas where we can generate higher margins enforce the sales growth and returns to shareholders remains a central theme for us at L-3. While NSS has performed well for their customers in this challenging environment, we believe that the improving DoD budget presents better capital deployment alternatives for us. The strategic review of NSS is well under way and we expect to make further announcements at the appropriate time. 
Turning to our Aerospace Systems business. We continue to have challenges with our 3 head-of-state aircraft programs, resulting in additional cost growth of approximately $84 million. As we stated last quarter, there is risk remaining on the contracts, and during the second quarter, we experienced new challenges that impacted the schedule and increased our estimated cost to complete the work. We have addressed leadership and program management and continue to work with our customers to deliver the aircraft. We've made a number of site visits to the facility and are dedicating significant attention and our best resources to these programs. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet personally with one of our customers to assure them of our focus and update them on our work. Bottom line, this is a complex program. We have more to do, but we have our arms around the issues and are taking the necessary steps to address them. Ralph will discuss the second quarter charges relating to these issues in more detail later. 
Turning to our second quarter results. We had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of about 7% compared with the 2014 second quarter. During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $227 million. This is a decrease from the second quarter of 2014, when we generated $277 million in net cash. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.8 billion, which was about a 14% decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $10 billion of funded backlog. 
As I will discuss later, our mission integration division within Aerospace Systems continued building on its strong track record of excellent program performance. During the second quarter, we delivered large complex ISR aircraft on budget and ahead of schedule for DoD and international customers. From a business generation standpoint, we secured key contracts across all of our segments, making continued progress repositioning our portfolio and achieving efficiencies in our business units. 
As evidence of our disciplined portfolio-shaping strategy, we recently announced that we expanded our commercial aviation training solutions business through the acquisition of CTC Aviation Group. This acquisition, which is immediately accretive to our operating results, fits squarely within our strategy to expand our international and commercial presence in key markets by focusing on higher-margin businesses with #1 and #2 positions and with the strongest prospects for future growth. I can say for this particular acquisition, the margins are expected to be about double the margins of the entire Electronic Systems group. So we're very pleased with the prospects for CTC, and it's an excellent fit for us. 
In addition, our CTC acquisition extends our commercial aviation business and allows L-3 to offer enhanced worldwide capabilities through a broader portfolio of training devices and delivery systems as well as scalable training solutions. This represents an important growth opportunity for us, given the well-recognized shortage of new commercial airline pilots around the globe. 
We also completed the divestiture of our MSI business during the quarter, which will result in improved margins and free up capital to be reinvested in higher growth, higher-margin opportunities. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition and portfolio-shaping opportunities. As always, our goal is to complement L-3's existing businesses with new acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We are actively looking at businesses that will meet these criteria. We're also continuing to invest in our core businesses as well as developing promising technologies that fit our customers' evolving requirements and enable L-3 to penetrate new markets and upgrade our product offerings. By doing so, we will leverage our strong cash flow, including returning more capital to our shareholders. 
We are increasing our strategic investments in defense electronics, simulators and training as well as solutions to counter the ever-increasing anti-access area denial threats from near-peer adversaries. We are focusing resources to be consistent with the third offset strategy and Secretary Kendall's long-range R&D planning program. We expect that IRAD will represent close to 2.5% of our 2015 revenue, reflecting our commitment to investment in areas related to our core businesses. 
Importantly, we are yielding innovative results, particularly in the area of classified programs, where we are delivering new capabilities and products to our customers and pursuing new business opportunities. Along those lines, L-3 has been partnering and collaborating with other innovative private-sector technology companies in order to provide the warfighter with the latest technology, systems that can be trusted and are effective in a wide range of operational contexts with the ability to respond to changing conditions. And given the global threat environment, what we're seeing is reconfigurable systems win the day, and that's where we are focusing. 
I'd now like to make some brief comments on each of our business segments and touch on some important awards and milestones. In Electronic Systems, our largest segment, we made progress in securing new business and continued to gain international and commercial market share. A great win for us in this space was the competitive award for the delivery of 3 A320 simulators and 1 787 simulator for Hainan Airlines in China. We also received a 5-year contract to deliver Block 4 Low Profile Photonics Masts for Virginia-class subs. This key win helps L-3 maintain its position as the supplier of this critical technology and creates additional opportunities to work with allied navies. 
Additionally, we had a strategic win to supply a chipset and circuit breaker for a naval customer in the Republic of Korea. We were also awarded a contract to provide integrated platform management systems to frigates in the Taiwanese Navy. Lastly, sales of WESCAM turrets remain robust, with new orders for the MX-10 units from the U.S. Army, Airbus and the Royal Saudi Air Force. Overall, we're pleased with the performance of the segment and continue to make progress improving our margin profile. 
In the Aerospace Systems segment, I have high confidence in our team and expect we will see improving performance and execution in this segment going forward. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we recently received a contract extension from the U.S. Army on the C-12 program. This extension becomes effective August 1 and has new terms that are profitable for L-3. 
We also received additional funding for a number of programs, including the Gorgon Stare program, the SPYDR program in Saudi Arabia and the C-27J program in Australia. We will remain focused on improving performance in this segment, delivering for our customers an increasing market share and core margins across the business. 
In our Communication Systems segment, we had a strong quarter and are continuing to work on both margin improvement and technology development. We have a solid domestic military business and received continued funding for legacy DoD programs, including Hawklink, WIN-T, ROVER and Global Hawk. And we also received a new contract on a cyber program for the Army Intelligence Center of Excellence. 
In the space domain, we secured a contract to supply the Traveling Wave Tubes on the AMRAAM seeker through 2018. As we have noted in the past, L-3 is 1 of only 2 global suppliers capable of performing this work. 
We also received an award to develop a new SATCOM modem for the E-4B aircraft. This will be another critical piece of L-3's offering in the senior leader continuity of government communication suite for the DoD. 
And our International business is expanding in this segment, with Australia as a key market. We're doing advanced communications work on 2 key naval programs that creates the opportunity for L-3 to become the maritime integrated communication systems provider of choice for this customer. The recent expansion of our SATCOM business in Australia establishes L-3 as the leading supplier of Manpack through 2.4-meter-sized SATCOM terminals for the Ministry of Defence's Wideband Global SATCOM or WGS communication system. In Canada, we made initial penetration into a large potential maritime market to provide communications for 6 Arctic/Offshore Patrol Ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. 
Within the National Security Solutions segment, results were primarily impacted by the continued delay of some international contract awards. That said, NSS has a well-established reputation for performance through decades of serving customers successfully. We had some notable contract wins in NSS during the quarter, including the Royal Saudi Air Force air operations center training contract. This contract represents a foreign military sales ID/IQ opportunity, under which L-3 will provide air operations center and training to personnel in Saudi Arabia for a 5-year performance period. We also won an international biometric contract. Finally, we received notice that a protest of the JIOC TAAS program was resolved in our favor. 
Shifting gears, let me update you on our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to see increasing momentum in the second half of the year. We continue to operate in a challenging macro environment related to budget uncertainties, which impacts our business. However, we're seeing clear signs that the downturn is approaching bottom and the DoD budget is either stabilizing or on an upswing. In fact, we anticipate an acceleration in the contracting environment as the government fiscal year closes. 
Regardless of the industry dynamics, we are committed to delivering value to the shareholders and to deploying capital in ways that contribute to that goal. Share repurchases and dividends continued to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy, and during the quarter, we returned almost $300 million to our shareholders. $246 million of it was in the form of common stock repurchases, with the balance in dividends. 
As always, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. We're looking for ways to expand our international and commercial footprint as well as our DoD business to capitalize on the expected uptick in the defense budget. Taken together, this will provide even better value to our customers by offering a broader range of innovative products. This improving environment is creating opportunities to redeploy capital into higher value-added areas. The sale of MSI, along with the acquisition of CTC, are an example of this strategy. Likewise, our evaluation of strategic alternatives for NSS is another effort. This will further strengthen our core business, improve our margin and sales growth profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company. We will make further announcements regarding the NSS process at the appropriate time. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ralph to review the financial data in more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."
93538,307196008,843588,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results, including the unusual charges, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we had several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quick",1377,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results, including the unusual charges, and then review our 2015 guidance update. However, before I review those items, we had several positives in the second quarter, and I want to quickly cover a few of them. First, we had another solid quarterly book-to-bill ratio, setting us up for the second half to return to profitable organic top line growth. Secondly, we had improving top line and healthy core margin performance in Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and the ISR system sector and Aerospace Systems segment, which comprised of businesses where we want to intend -- where we intend to prospectively focus the portfolio. And third, we generated a robust cash flow of $183 million in the second quarter. 
That said, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41, with the operating margin of 5.9% for the second quarter. And second quarter sales, operating income, margin and EPS were below what we expected because of the $103 million of charges at the Platform Integration division in the Aerospace Systems segment, which lowered EPS by $0.77. 
Income tax gains totaling $0.43 of EPS partially offset those charges. These items together caused a net reduction of $0.34 to EPS and 350 basis points to operating margin. The contract charges of Platform Integration division primarily relate to the additional losses of $84 million on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
When we reported our first quarter results, we were expecting to deliver 1 aircraft at the end of June and the next by the end of December. And at that time, we explained that until we deliver those aircraft, we have lingering inherent risks. During the second quarter, we completed certain ground and flight tests; customer inspections on the first 2 aircraft, which revealed significant additional and more extensive rework; and on the third aircraft, we completed a series of design reviews. 
Consequently, the delivery dates for each aircraft have slipped an average of 10 months and the estimated cost to complete those 3 contracts have increased by $84 million in the aggregate. 
To be clear, we're really disappointed by the size of the additional cost growth charges on the head-of-state contracts. However, the head-of-state contract performance problems are transitory. We will eventually complete the interior modifications and deliver those aircraft and they will be high-quality aircraft. More importantly, while the second quarter charges are very painful, they will not continue to disrupt the company's financial performance because head-of-state aircraft modifications comprised a very small, sporadic part of our business base. To provide you some more context, the head-of-state modifications contracts usually have sale prices of about $150 million per contract, with periods of performance of about 4 years. It is not steady, recurring, annual business. Procurement cycles are usually 10 years or longer, thus, head-of-state modifications comprise less than 1% of our annual consolidated sales. 
Moving on to second quarter segment results. Sales and operating margin for the Electronic Systems and Communication Systems were ahead of our expectations. And Aerospace Systems would've also exceeded our expectations if it were not for the Platform Integration division charges. The NSS segment performance continued to lag our estimates for the second quarter. At Electronic Systems, organic sales growth was minus 1%, with solid operating margin of 11.5%. Favorable sales mix due mostly to more commercial aviation product sales largely offset unusual charges of $14 million in that segment. We incurred an incremental charge of $8 million in anticipation of a settlement for a product specifications matter with the U.S. government pertaining to our EOTech holographic weapon sights. And at the end of June, we received an adverse arbitration ruling of $6 million stemming from a dispute with a nonperforming supplier that we terminated back in 2011. 
For Aerospace Systems segment, excluding the $103 million of contract cost growth charges and platform integration, operating margin would've been about 8%, driven by continued strong program performance at ISR Systems sector, where the margins exceed 10%. 
At Communication Systems segment, top line pressures began to abate toward the second quarter, with sales only declining about 4%, and operating margin was a very healthy 10.4%, tracking higher than our full year estimates. We had better margin performance in both broadband communications and advanced communications. And at NSS, sales and margins were, again, lower than what we expected due to continued delays in booking of select high-margin international and commercial work, which had similarly impacted the first quarter results. Encouragingly, we booked some of those new contracts in late June and in July, but these awards were not soon enough to benefit the second quarter. 
To this point, NSS had another strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.21x for the second quarter, supporting the sequential sales growth that we expect to realize there in the second half of this year. 
With respect to the guidance update for 2015, substantially all the changes relate to the second quarter contract cost growth charges at Platform Integration, mostly in the head-of-state contracts and the unrelated tax gains in the quarter. We lowered our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.65 -- or $0.09 to a new midpoint of $6.85. And with respect to sales, we maintained the guidance range of $11,450,000,000 to $11,650,000,000, which now includes an increase of $50 million at Electronic Systems for the CTC Aviation Group acquisition that we completed on May 27, and it also includes a $50 million sales decrease at Aerospace Systems due mostly to the head-of-state contract adjustments. 
If you pro forma the MSI divestiture, our full year consolidated sales are expected to decline about 2%. And adjusting for all acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic sales to decline about 3% versus 2014.  
In terms of our segment guidance update, other than the Aerospace Systems adjustments, there are no other major changes or items that require explanation, so I'll leave those for the Q&A to the extent that you have any questions on those. 
But I will say that regarding NSS segment guidance, we still expect sales and margin to increase in the second half of the year. And there is risk there related to some of that high-margin international commercial orders, which we expect to add about $60 million to sales and 170 basis points to operating margin for the year in the segment. The remaining increases in the second half of this year versus the first half of NSS pertain to sales volumes of about $80 million and new program ramp-ups, for which the contracts are in backlog, and higher award fees, each of which will add about 40 basis points to full year NSS margin. 
With respect to free cash flow, we lowered our estimate for the year by $75 million to $850 million, primarily due to the head-of-state contract issues. In addition to estimated cash outlays of about $40 million for the cost growth charges that we'll incur in the second half of this year on those programs, we had about $50 million of cash collections that were tied to delivering the first 2 aircraft this year, and those collections have slipped to 2016 and 2017. We expect our free cash flow to return to over $900 million in 2016. 
With respect to our capital allocation, we are still assuming $800 million of share repurchases for the year. During the first half, we repurchased $346 million, leaving about $450 million for the second half of this year. 
We are now planning to repay about $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and that is because we are committed to preserving our investment-grade credit ratings. We still expect the full year book-to-bill ratio to be approximately 1.0x. 
So I'd like to conclude my financial comments by summarizing with the fact that the DoD budget is stabilizing and will likely increase beginning in FY '16, which begins in a few months from now. Although our first half results were disappointing, order flow was solid and encouraging and we had several bright spots in our key business areas. We expect our financial performance to improve significantly in the second half of this year, and we'll continue to generate robust cash flow and effectively allocate capital to increase shareholder value. Thank you. 
We'll now begin the Q&A."

So you asked about question -- the question was, what are the normalized margins? So they're about 9%. And I want to pause the segment for you because I made some comments about a couple of the sectors. So a little more than half of Aerospace Systems is ISR Systems, which is our strongest business in that segment. In fact, a very strong business in general. The margins there are very healthy, and I said that they exceed 10%. Logistics Solutions is about $1.2 billion in sales this year, and that is a business that we're still in the process of rebuilding and strengthening, if you will. And Mike talked about the new army C-12 contract that begins in a couple of days from now. That will become a profitable -- will be a profitable job compared to the previous army C-12 work that we've done the last several years. So that's a big step towards improving Logistics Solutions. But Logistics Solutions margins, on a normalized basis, are in the 4% to 5% range. And then lastly, Platform Systems, which we now call Aircraft Systems, which includes the Platform Integration business, that's the remaining sector in the segment, which is about $800 million of sales. And the margins there are, on a normalized basis, should be in the high single-digit range. They are nowhere near that right now because of the problems that we've had on head-of-state, but that's where they're going to head back towards."

So Cai, so the management changes that we talked about that we made at the Platform Integration division, including the President and many of the senior leadership positions as well as program management on all 3 of the head-of-state contracts. Those changes were made in the middle of April, around April 20. And those folks, together with us, has been assessing these contract EACs since then. As Mike said, we also changed the Aerospace Systems segment President early in June, and we did a press release on that on June 3. So the second question you asked was what's happening with the delivery dates on the 3 contracts? And when I -- in my prepared comments, I explained that, on average, the delivery dates are slipping by about 10 months for each of the 3 contracts. Aside from that, I don't want to get into the particular dates for each of the 3 contracts, but I will tell you that we're not going to be delivering any of those aircraft this year, and the deliveries will be made in 2016 and 2017. In terms of key performance milestones that need to occur between now and then, there are a series of them and may pertain to items, including a variety of flight test with and without the customers present, obtaining FAA certifications for each of the aircraft and then going through some customer training periods on each of the 3 aircraft. Those performance milestones are staggered over the next year or 2, and they happen on appropriate times on each of the 3 contracts. So clearly, we're very close on the first aircraft. I'd say about halfway there on the second one. And you may recall that on the third aircraft, I explained that we're going to receive that aircraft next month. So that's clearly mostly in front of us right now. We did some very detailed reviews during the quarter, which we do in every quarter for that matter, and we factored in the experiences that we had in the second quarter on those contracts when we developed the estimates. And on the first aircraft, we've experienced and incurred a lot of rework issues. And we've taken that experience and we've made changes to make sure we don't repeat that on the second 2 aircraft. So we will -- we have our arms around all 3 contracts. Did I answer all your questions, Cai?"

I mean, although SPYDR was designed to be an export product, it does have differences from the performance parameters that Project Liberty had, that renewed the interest in the U.S. government on it, on the platform. And particularly, the potential to augment what they already have. Again, it'll be driven by requirements and things, but it's a highly capable, highly versatile aircraft. And as I said during my presentation, reconfigurable seems to rule the day in today's world. If you're operating in very different theaters with very different requirements, you're looking for different types of signals, you're dealing with different terrain. We make these aircraft highly reconfigurable in the field so you don't need a fleet of different aircraft to do different missions. They're very, very versatile, and that has gotten a lot of attention. And I think the U.S. government interest on it is something beyond what we thought about when we initially invested in this platform because it was really an export product. So we're happy to sell it domestically. 
Okay. Well, thank you. In conclusion, I'd like to spend just a moment or 2 talking about L-3's strategy and why we believe we're well positioned to grow our global footprint, expand our market share and enhance our long-term shareholder value. At its core, our strategy is very straightforward. We're focused on performance and capturing new opportunities. We are transforming the business portfolio to sharpen our focus on the markets where we do best and have leading positions. Lastly, we are focused on leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in areas critical to the future of our business. Most important, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders. 
In the second quarter, we returned approximately $300 million between the repurchases and dividends, and we will continue to utilize that strategy to drive value. Again, the performance in Aerospace was a big disappointment, but we will get beyond it and turn the corner, and I'm confident we have the right people on the job and that we have a lot of good things to look forward to at L-3, including the portfolio sharpening that's well under way. 
So with that, thank you for joining us. I hope everyone has a nice remainder of the summer, and we will look forward to speaking with you again in the fall in October. So thank you."

Overall we had solid operating results with higher operating margins in our Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. We also",2184,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call. 
Overall we had solid operating results with higher operating margins in our Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. We also continue to make good progress on the divestiture of our national security solutions business and expect to make an announcement by year-end. This quarter, we recognized the noncash goodwill impairment charge related to NSS. Ralph will provide more details on that charge in his remarks. 
Yesterday, as I'm sure you've seen, we announced that Chris Chubasik has joined L-3 as President and CEO. Chris has over 30 years of operational experience in the aerospace and defense industry and is a terrific addition to our already strong leadership team and we're all very pleased to have him at L-3. His actions reflect our commitment to positioning our portfolio to sharpen our focus on our higher returning electronics communications and ISR businesses where we have market-leading positions. These are areas that are critical to the security of our nation. 
Further, we continue to evaluate our portfolio for additional opportunities to improve our strategic position and create value for our shareholders. As we have stated, we're looking to focus on businesses with stronger margin profiles and higher returns in markets where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. We expect to redeploy capital generated by these and future strategic initiatives into our existing portfolio as well as the fund acquisitions that drive the stronger returns.
While we continue to face certain macro challenges, we are laser-focused on execution and investing in areas that will improve the overall performance of our portfolio. In many areas of our business, our efforts are yielding positive results, as reflected in some important contract wins in the quarter and we have successfully expanded our customer base. 
Turning to our third quarter results, we had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the 2014 third quarter.
We delivered strong bottom line performance, thanks to our continued focus on pursuing higher margin business and disciplined course management. Our consolidated segment operating positions are improving and are better-than-expected at 10.2% for the quarter. And we're pleased about that. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.4 billion, which was a slight decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $9.4 billion of funded backlog, with a book-to-bill ratio for the quarter of about 0.86 and 0.98 year-to-date.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $317 [ph] million, most of which we returned to shareholders.
We repurchased $259 million of our stock in the quarter and paid $52 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $800 million in cash to shareholders.
Before I go through our wins for the quarter, I'd like to give an update on other key business items across the company. Our progress on the Head of State programs continues to meet our estimates and schedules as discussed on our second quarter call. Earlier this week, we successfully completed a key customer checkout flight. Our progress has been very encouraging. The new management team we put in place has been very focused on the program and we're seeing the results of their efforts every day.
Operationally, we're also taking steps to improve program performance and to create value for customers through continued investments in R&D and new technology development. As an example of our R&D efforts, our focus on innovation helped us secure a broadband communications systems contract for Apache helicopter. This is the case where we devised a technology enhancement on behalf of our customer and delivered an unprecedented command and control capability. This is an area where I would call it thought leadership for our team, where we identified a potential solution for our customer and developed it on our own that really enables an unprecedented man to unmanned teaming capacity that until now has not been available. So we're very proud of that accomplishment and the customer is very happy with the solution.
In terms of M&A, our goal is to complement L-3's existing business with new acquisitions and expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. Our recent acquisition of Forseks [ph] is a great example of that. We've worked with this company for 7 years and it adds new capabilities and customers, which allows us to compete in broader markets.
Forseks [ph] specializes in the processing, exploitation and dissemination of information. This technology enables a rapid decision making ability from the data collected by our sensor. This complements our wide-area imagery and sensor expertise that we will be able to integrate Forseks software into our existing EOI sensors, cards and subsystems. In short, we've transformed L-3 from a sensor supplier to an information supplier in a very strategic ISR market area.
Plus this also creates a software upgrade opportunities with our installed base of thousands of L-3 sensor products.
In addition, our acquisition of CTC earlier this year has continued to prove a strong fit. As we discussed last quarter, the commercial aviation training market is enjoying record demand for professionally trained pilots and forecast showed that over 550,000 pilots will be required in the next 20 years. The combined CTC aviation and Link U.K. businesses are performing well and the synergies between these 2 companies are benefiting customers around the world. We've had unanimous positive responses from our customers and industry on this new capability. As a result, we expanded our pilot training in our sensor in Thailand and are developing our business in the U.K. We're now providing training on our A320 and 737 simulators at the recently launched quality training facility outside of Gatwick airport in London with plans to expand our position in this market.
This is a great example of our M&A strategy and we are actively looking at acquiring businesses that will meet our criteria for both margin expansion and top line growth and enhance our existing portfolio of market-leading technologies.
Finally, I'm very pleased to report that we've been recognized, once again, with Cogswell awards for outstanding industrial security practices at 3 L-3 facilities. We insist on the highest standards in all aspect of our operations and we are honored to receive these awards. Our approach in this area has been to make our industrial security program a business discriminator as it continues to become more important in our current environment. 
Now I'd like to discuss some of those wins we've had across our defense commercial aviation and international businesses.
So on the defense side, we were focused on DoD priority areas including ISR communications, sensors and the classified space. With regard to the defense budget, while we continue to believe that we are nearing the end of an extended period of uncertainty, we're experiencing a delay in the anticipated DoD budget update. However, the bipartisan budget agreement provides 2 years of funding with an increase of $38 billion in fiscal '16 from the '15 DoD budget. This is a good fit for L-3 as it enables our long-term planning ability and advances the contract award process. We also have quick reaction capabilities that are sought after as well as ISR upgrade, maintenance and weapon systems sustainment expertise.
The agreement will facilitate this work and is expected to translate into increased activity from programs that we already support. In the third quarter, we received some strategic awards that will further grow our business. As I mentioned earlier, we've been selected to provide our broadband comps system for the U.S. Army's Apache helicopter. This was a major win for us where we designed a spiral developed a new solution based on an earlier combat proof of design. This is what I just described as manned unmanned teaming expertise.
It's noticed, Novel TX under that program and we will provide at the Apache with its first ever video and broadband data transmission with multiple universal unmanned platforms.
We were also awarded a contract to missionize 2 C-130 aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard with options missionize 10 additional C-130 aircraft that provide ground flight test support for them. This is a great programming for our team at Waco.
We were selected to supply our key management infrastructure for the intelligence community as part of the last mile portable key load program. This is a 10-year program that extends our leadership position and information assurance. 
This quarter, we are on the spot on 2 ID/IQ contracts, the U.S. air forces TSA 3 and Agile acquisition programs. 
Finally, in our military simulation business, we received a contract extension for our C-17 simulation program. 
For commercial aviation, we're at the beginning of a growth cycle driven primarily by expansions in developing regions and localized carriers with Asia dominating. It's predicted that the worldwide fleet size will more than double in the next 20 years. 
As the air transport OEMs continue to forecast increased production rates, directives such as the 2020 ADSP out mandate continue to drive growth in the U.S. and Europe. We have a strong commercial aviation business and we have increased our efforts to capitalize on opportunities in this market.
In our training business Boeing ordered its first 787 Reality 7 full flight simulator. We also received notification that we have been selected by 2 airlines and an OEM for new simulators. These sales will represent a major step in expanding our base in strategically important regions.
In aviation security, we're concentrating on upgrading our technology and recently received funding from the TSA for software development and algorithms for our examiner systems as well as an order for France for our check bagger systems. The use of our probation system continues to expand globally. We are participating in key product demonstrations at several airports in Japan aimed at the adoption of systems there. 
In addition, our nuclear scan system for carry-on baggage will soon be deployed at major -- at a major international airport. That is another example of our folks identifying a solution that they believe to be widely accepted. Everybody knows how troubling it is to have liquids taken out of your carry-on bags or take out computers and turn them on. What we've been able to do utilizing computed tomography or CT and advanced algorithm -- detection algorithms, we've been able to allow travelers to leave liquids and electronics in their bags as they make their way through security checkpoints. And the system will detect whether there's a bad substance or energetic material that doesn't belong there. So as we all know, using the machine to do the detection is a heck of a lot more efficient and should keep lines moving better and provide much better detection capability.
In the international space, part of our strategy is growing our international sales, which we know can be a lumpy business, but it still remains a focus area for us. I'd like to highlight a few of the wins we had during the quarter. 
Our integrated platform management system was selected by the Royal Canadian Navy as part of a major vessel conversion project. We achieved the first international sale of our Catapan [ph] global encryption product. This marks an important win for our encryption business as we continue to support to secure communication requirements for a variety of international government customers. 
We also received continued funding of legacy programs, including Argentina C-130 and the U.K. Airseeder [ph] program.
Now let's turn to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We have positive momentum as we move into the fourth quarter and are capitalizing on this with solid execution and program performance. We continue to explore possible additions to the L-3 portfolio that we believe are a good fit and that further strengthen our core business, improve margin and sales profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company.
Our goal is to expand our market share, extend our product offerings and capabilities, attract new customers and of course grow shareholder value.
We also remain committed to investing in R&D and are encouraged that our investments are paying dividends. We target key areas to keep our technology portfolio fresh and relevant and will continue to invest in this critical area going forward. 
That said, L-3 is well-positioned in several DoD priority areas, including persistent ISR and protected communications, unmanned systems, space and the classified arena.
We're confident that our growth strategies, together with our strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy, positions us well to drive value to shareholders. We'll end this year on a strong note well prepared and energize driving improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio into 2016.
We provided our initial outlook in the release this morning. We'll release our guidance and provide further perspective for 2016 at an upcoming Investor Day, which we will be hosting in New York City on Tuesday, December 8.
So I'm going to turn it over to Ralph now for some more details on the financials. And then we'll be back and take your questions. So with that, Ralph?"
93538,314949083,885409,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. We had a strong operational performance for the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, w",1204,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. 
We had a strong operational performance for the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, which was better than what our outlook was for the third quarter. It was driven primarily by higher operating margin as well as lower taxes, which more than offset softer-than-expected sales. Free cash flow was $263 million for the quarter and also very solid.
Adjusted diluted EPS excludes gains and losses on business divestitures and the noncash NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter's consolidated sales were $2,817,000,000 [ph] and declined 1% organically. Sales were about $130 million left in our third quarter guidance and that was due to delays and reductions in international and commercial business.
NSS had another disappointing quarter and missed a plane again, primarily due to continued delays in converting higher-margin international and commercial business, which had similarly impacted NSS's first half results.
A smaller negative impact for NSS has been tasking delays on various DoD ID/IQ contract vehicles.
As a result, we reassessed and reduced NSS future outlook for sales and operating margins, and this triggered the NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter operating margins were better than we anticipated in every other segment, with margins for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems moving higher and exhibiting the improvement trends which we've been articulating. 
Aerospace Systems margin rebounded sharply from the second quarter and it benefited from some items that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter or next year. 
In the ISR systems sector, we had sales volume and better contract performance on 3 large international contracts that are nearing completion, and those raised margin over 200 basis points for the segment.
In the logistics solutions sector, we received an $8 million request for equitable adjustment to recover a portion of the prior year cost overruns on a previous Army C-12 contract, which raised margin another 80 [ph] basis points for the segment.
Excluding these items, Aerospace Systems third quarter margin would have been less than 7%. 
With respect to our 2015 guidance update, with tightened our adjusted EPS range and maintained the midpoint at $6.85. The lower operating income expectation for NSS is being offset by a combination of higher margin than the other segments and a lower tax rate.
We also reduced our consolidated sales at the midpoint by $100 million to $11,450,000,000 [ph], and that's due to the international and commercial sales trend that I talked about a few minutes ago, which mostly impacts Electronic Systems and NSS.  And we also reduced consolidated operating margin by a modest 10 basis points to 8.3%.
We maintained our free cash flow estimate of $850 million for the year. And with respect to our capital allocation, we are assuming $740 million of share repurchases for 2015, after shifting $60 million to pay for the Force X acquisition earlier this month. We still plan to repay $300 [ph] million of debt in the fourth quarter.
And for the last point on the 2015 guidance, we now expect the book-to-bill ratio for the year to be approximately 0.97, and that again is due to the lower expected international and commercial orders that I talked about, which will impact 2016 sales. 
So scrolling forward to our preliminary outlook for 2016, we expect consolidated sales to decline about 3% to $11.1 billion. And this estimate assumes an organic sales decline of about 1.5%. The major change since we last discussed the 2016 sales trends, again is that now we expect international sales to decline about 15% in 2016 versus 2015. 
We still expect our U.S. Government sales, including the DoD, to be flat organically versus '15. And commercial sales are expected to grow about 7%. 
With respect to the international sales, I'd like to add that we continue to expect foreign military business to be a long-term growth driver for L-3, however as you know, the international business is inherently lumpy and less predictable than the U.S. DoD business. And international is growing at a very nice pace over the last several years. It's going to take a pause in 2016 before we start to grow it again after next year.
At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth to be 1% to 2% for Electronic Systems. And that will be offset by declines of about 4% for each of Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems. 
For operating margin, we expect consolidated margin to increase 80 basis points to about 9.1% next year with the margins increasing in all 4 segments.
The margin progressions are on target for Electronic Systems to the mid-12% range and for Communication Systems to the low 10% range. However, margins are below our objectives for Aerospace Systems and NSS. 
With respect to Aerospace Systems, the margin for next year is expected to be in the low 6% range. And it's a very different story when you look at the 3 sectors in Aerospace Systems. So ISR Systems sector will have margins for 2016 that will continue to be very solid at about 10%, but they will decline versus 2015 due to those lower international sales and those contract ending that I talked about earlier. As well as the final run-off in the Afghanistan drawdown sales. 
Aircraft Systems sector margins will swing to profitability in 2016 following the head of state aircraft losses that we incurred in the first half of 2015, but those margins are only going to improve to about 3%. And last week, logistics solutions margin will remain about 2%, as it continues to wrestle with the pricing pressures, LPGA and reduced flight hours. 
The tax rate for next year is expected to be 31%, and that assumes no federal or any tax credit. And you can be assured that we're tasking our tax advice -- tax advice is to drive that rate down again like we did in 2016 [ph] -- 2015. 
With respect to free cash flow. We expect it to be at $850 [ph] million for 2016, the same as it is expected to be for 2015. And what's happening there is that higher operating income is being offset by larger income tax payments due to the tax rate going up. Our planned share repurchases for 2016 start at $500 million. And all of these items that I just discussed for next year, in terms of the outlook, calculate to EPS of about $7.25 for 2016.
So to conclude with my financial review, L-3 is in the process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance and margin expansion and making good progress, especially in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. We are also transforming our portfolio of businesses to strengthen the company and enhance our financial performance. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. 
We acknowledge that we have work to do. We can do better and we will. And finally, I'd also like to say that I look forward to working with Chris and I'm pleased that he joined L-3. 
With that, thank you. And we'll go to the Q&A."

You couple that with the demand for pilots over the next 10 to 20 years, it looks like the very good story for us, being able to not only deliver a state of the art devices, but wrapping the service element around that of trainers has made it a very strong business for us and we look forward to that growing over the future.
On top of that, the Forseks [ph] is a good example, again of taking an existing leading product, our ERR chart, which is virtually on every manned and unmanned platform that has an ERR chart. And baking into that, software capability to do more analytical work on the data that the sensor gathers. So not just providing raw imagery, if you will, but it's actually providing actionable information and putting the processing capacity on the platform and getting it off the ground, if you will. So getting quicker information into the hands of the war fighter. So that also will expand the market by taking an existing product and expanding its capability. We also have an installed base of those products, which gives us a ready market to go out and provide upgrades to. On the margin side, [indiscernible] expand margins are won by targeting businesses in our acquisition program that are better margins or have that potential, but also working through our portfolio of businesses with an eye towards either consolidation or other forms of cost take out, whether it's in the facility area, better supply-chain management, overall better program execution is kind of an obvious one there. But generally, the entire cost model is being challenged in virtually every business units. So we've been very clear with our leadership teams in all our groups and divisions that margin expansion is going to be a criteria that they're going to be measured on. And we're happy with the response we're getting from them. They understand it and are being very responsive to us."

So we booked a large terminal order earlier this year for Australia, which was about $80 [ph] million. And we're going to expect to ship that order this year. And while we do see follow-ons there, we won't get the next quarter until late in 2016 or early in 2017. So that's going to cause an $80 million drop in international sales in Communication Systems segment. That's when the items affecting the international profile I just talked about with respect to a previous question from Rob. And then secondly, within Communication Systems, we do about $300 million a year or so on power devices or TWTs that are used in a variety of platforms, including in satellites. And there's been a slow down in new commercial satellite orders this year, or think it's only 7 or so that have been ordered year-to-date, which compared to a normal year of about 20 or so SATs. And for that reason, we expect to have about $60 million to $70 million sales decline next year in that business, in the TWT business, which is in Communication Systems. And that's also affecting the sales next year. And what that is offsetting is growth in the DoD business, especially in the broadband comps or comps systems West. And that business has been recovering very nicely the last 1.5 year or so. We overcame the European implementation issues that we had there in the last couple of years. And it looks like it's going to be on a nice growth path going forward the next several years. So that's what's happening in comp systems, Cai."

And businesses that didn't fit that profile have been looked at more carefully with an eye towards potentially divesting. So in terms of timing, I would say we're looking at over the next year or so. This is a process that we look at regularly and will necessarily change as things change around us. We'll adopt or adapt to those changes and adopt whatever strategies we think are necessary for time to ensure our continued margin expansion and growth. But in terms of size, I really can't give you a number off the top of my head in terms of sales volume. But to tell you that everything that you would think of that is performing below our composite in margins is being looked at carefully.

But the answer is no, we still tend to have a significant level of economy in our business unit level. We believe that, that decision making is made best when it's done closest to the customer, but as long as it's done within the parameters that we lay out for our people. And with that in mind, I think adding Chris and his experience with the team will kind of enhance that whole process."

So there's definitely room for more budget. And what we hear from a lot of our elected leaders talking about that hopefully they can bring that to fruition in the next couple of years."

It's not just going to be the margins and outlook for the business going forward without giving the wrong direction. If you think logistics, which keeps coming up, yes, margins have been lower. Hurt by competitive issues as well as the overall downward pressure on margins, however, if you look at where the U.S. service people are operating, it's all over the world. And logistics happens to be a discriminator that makes that possible. It's a key enabler for our militaries. It's having a very robust logistics environment around them. So it's something that I think may get renewed focus by the DoD. But again, we here are focused on doing whatever it is we need to do to drive value. So it's the whole package, whether it's margin, top line growth, the combination of the two. So it's all in the table. And we will take those actions, George. 
So just concluding, moving forward, we plan -- we believe the actions that we have taken and the plans we put in place reflect our customer's priorities and give us a clear path to significantly improve our revenue and earnings performance over time. At its core, our strategy for discipline growth is simple and straightforward. We are repositioning our portfolio and investing in our businesses, our people and our technologies, as well as levering our cash flow generation to maintain market leadership in our core businesses and return cash to our shareholders. 
We're focused on higher return businesses in markets where we maintain leading positions. We're excited about L-3's progress and prospects for enhancing and expanding our defense electronics, ISR and communications businesses, areas where we have market-leading positions and that represent the core of L-3. 
We're committed to long-term strategic growth and performance and we'll continue to work to deliver value for all shareholders. As I've mentioned a couple of times now, we plan on hosting an Investor Day in New York on December 8. We will provide additional color and detail in our strategy, our ongoing business transformation and our key initiatives for 2016, and I look forward to seeing you all there and continuing this dialogue.

And thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call. 
Overall we had solid operating results with higher operating margins in our Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. We also continue to make good progress on the divestiture of our national security solutions business and expect to make an announcement by year-end. This quarter, we recognized the noncash goodwill impairment charge related to NSS. Ralph will provide more details on that charge in his remarks. 
Yesterday, as I'm sure you've seen, we announced that Chris Chubasik has joined L-3 as President and COO. Chris has over 30 years of operational experience in the aerospace and defense industry and is a terrific addition to our already strong leadership team, and we're all very pleased to have him at L-3. These actions reflect our commitment to positioning our portfolio to sharpen our focus on our higher returning electronics communications and ISR businesses where we have market-leading positions. These are areas that are critical to the security of our nation. 
Further, we continue to evaluate our portfolio for additional opportunities to improve our strategic position and create value for our shareholders. As we have stated, we're looking to focus on businesses with stronger margin profiles and higher returns in markets where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. We expect to redeploy capital generated by these and future strategic initiatives into our existing portfolio as well as the fund acquisitions that drive stronger returns.
While we continue to face certain macro challenges, we are laser-focused on execution and investing in areas that will improve the overall performance of our portfolio. In many areas of our business, our efforts are yielding positive results, as reflected in some important contract wins in the quarter, and we have successfully expanded our customer base. 
Turning to our third quarter results, we had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the 2014 third quarter.
We delivered strong bottom line performance, thanks to our continued focus on pursuing higher margin business and disciplined cost management. Our consolidated segment operating positions are improving and are better than expected at 10.2% for the quarter, and we're pleased about that. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.4 billion, which was a slight decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $9.4 billion of funded backlog, with a book-to-bill ratio for the quarter of about 0.86 and 0.98 year-to-date.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $317 million, most of which we returned to shareholders.
We repurchased $259 million of our stock in the quarter and paid $52 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $800 million in cash to shareholders.
Before I go through our wins for the quarter, I'd like to give an update on other key business items across the company. Our progress on the Head of State programs continues to meet our estimates and schedules as discussed on our second quarter call. Earlier this week, we successfully completed a key customer checkout flight. Our progress has been very encouraging. The new management team we put in place has been very focused on the program and we're seeing the results of their efforts every day.
Operationally, we're also taking steps to improve program performance and to create value for customers through continued investments in R&D and new technology development. As an example of our R&D efforts, our focus on innovation helped us secure our broadband communications systems contract for the Apache helicopter. This was a case where we devised a technology enhancement on behalf of our customer and delivered an unprecedented command and control capability. This is an area where I would call it thought leadership for our team, where we identify a potential solution for our customer and developed it on our own that really enables an unprecedented man-to-unmanned teaming capacity that, up until now, has not been available. So we're very proud of that accomplishment and the customer is very happy with the solution.
In terms of M&A, our goal is to complement L-3's existing business with new acquisitions and expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. Our recent acquisition of ForceX is a great example of that. We've worked with this company for 7 years and it adds new capabilities and customers, which allows us to compete in broader markets.
ForceX specializes in the processing, exploitation and dissemination of information. This technology enables a rapid decision-making ability from the data collected by our sensor. This complements our wide-area imagery and sensor expertise that we will be able to integrate ForceX software into our existing EOI sensors, cards and subsystems. In short, we've transformed L-3 from a sensor supplier to an information supplier in a very strategic ISR market area. Plus this also creates software upgrade opportunities with our installed base of thousands of L-3 sensor products.
In addition, our acquisition of CTC earlier this year has continued to prove a strong fit. As we discussed last quarter, the commercial aviation training market is enjoying record demand for professionally trained pilots and forecasts showed that over 550,000 pilots will be required in the next 20 years. The combined CTC aviation and Link U.K. businesses are performing well, and the synergies between these 2 companies are benefiting customers around the world. We've had unanimously positive responses from our customers and industry on this new capability. As a result, we've expanded pilot training in our sensor in Thailand and are developing our business in the U.K. We're now providing training on our A320 and 737 simulators at the recently launched Crawley training facility outside of Gatwick Airport in London with plans to expand our position in this market.
This is a great example of our M&A strategy and we are actively looking at acquiring businesses that will meet our criteria for both margin expansion and top line growth and enhance our existing portfolio of market-leading technologies.
Finally, I'm very pleased to report that we've been recognized once again with Cogswell Awards for outstanding industrial security practices at 3 L-3 facilities. We insist on the highest standards in all aspects of our operations, and we're honored to receive these awards. Our approach in this area has been to make our industrial security program a business discriminator as it continues to become more important in our current environment. 
Now I'd like to discuss some of the wins we've had across our defense, commercial aviation and international businesses.
So on the defense side, we were focused on DoD priority areas, including ISR communications, sensors and the classified space. With regard to the defense budget, while we continue to believe that we are nearing the end of an extended period of uncertainty, we're experiencing a delay in the anticipated DoD budget uptick. However, the bipartisan budget agreement provides 2 years of funding with an increase of $38 billion in fiscal '16 from the '15 DoD budget. This is a good fit for L-3, as it enables our long-term planning ability and advances the contract award process. We also have quick reaction capabilities that are sought after as well as ISR in upgrade, maintenance and weapon systems sustainment expertise.
The agreement will facilitate this work and is expected to translate into increased activity from programs that we already support. In the third quarter, we received some strategic awards that will further grow our business. As I mentioned earlier, we've been selected to provide our broadband comps system for the U.S. Army's Apache helicopter. This was a major win for us where we designed, inspired and developed a new solution based on an earlier combat proof of design. This is what I just described where it's a manned-unmanned teaming expertise.
It's known as MUM TX [ph]. And under that program, we will provide the Apache with its first-ever video and broadband data transmission with multiple universal unmanned platforms.
We were also awarded a contract to missionize 2 C-130 aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard with options to missionize 10 additional C-130 aircraft and provide ground flight test support for them. This is a great program win for our team at Waco.
We were selected to supply our key management infrastructure for the intelligence community as part of the last mile portable key loader program. This is a 10-year program that extends our leadership position and information assurance. 
This quarter, we are on the spot on 2 ID/IQ contracts, the U.S. air forces TSA 3 and Agile acquisition programs. 
Finally, in our military simulation business, we received a contract extension for our C-17 simulation program. 
For commercial aviation, we're at the beginning of a growth cycle driven primarily by expansions in developing regions and low-cost carriers, with Asia dominating. It's predicted that the worldwide fleet size will more than double in the next 20 years. 
As air transport OEMs continue to forecast increased production rates, directives such as the 2020 ADSP out mandate continue to drive growth in the U.S. and in Europe. We have a strong commercial aviation business and we have increased our efforts to capitalize on opportunities in this market.
In our training business, Boeing ordered its first 787 Reality 7 full flight simulator. We also received notification that we have been selected by 2 airlines and an OEM for new simulators. These sales will represent a major step in expanding our base in strategically important regions.
In aviation security, we're concentrating on upgrading our technology and recently received funding from the TSA for software development and algorithms for our examiner systems as well as an order from France for our check bagger systems. The use of our probation system continues to expand globally. We are participating in key product demonstrations at several airports in Japan, aimed at the adoption of systems there. 
In addition, our nuclear scan system for carry-on baggage will soon be deployed at major -- at a major international airport. That is another example of our folks identifying a solution that they believe to be widely accepted. Everybody knows how troubling it is to have liquids taken out of your carry-on bags or probably take out our computers and turn them on. What we've been able to do, utilizing computed tomography or CT and advanced algorithm -- detection algorithms, we've been able to allow travelers to leave liquids and electronics in their bags as they make their way through security checkpoints. And the system will detect whether there's a bad substance or energetic material that doesn't belong there. So as we all know, using the machine to do the detection is a heck of a lot more efficient and should keep lines moving better and provide much better detection capability.
In the international space, part of our strategy is growing our international sales, which we know can be a lumpy business, but it still remains a focus area for us. I'd like to highlight a few of the wins we had during the quarter. 
Our integrated platform management system was selected by the Royal Canadian Navy as part of a major vessel conversion project. We achieved the first international sale of our CATAPAN Global encryption product. This marks an important win for our encryption business as we continue to support to secure communication requirements for a variety of international government customers. 
We also received continued funding of legacy programs, including Argentina C-130 and the U.K. Airseeker program.
Now let's turn to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We have positive momentum as we move into the fourth quarter and are capitalizing on this with solid execution and program performance. We continue to explore possible additions to the L-3 portfolio that we believe are a good fit and that further strengthen our core business, improve margin and sales profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company.
Our goal is to expand our market share, extend our product offerings and capabilities, attract new customers and, of course, grow shareholder value.
We also remain committed to investing in R&D and are encouraged that our investments are paying dividends. We target key areas to keep our technology portfolio fresh and relevant and will continue to invest in this critical area going forward. 
That said, L-3 is well-positioned in several DoD priority areas, including persistent ISR and protected communications, unmanned systems, space and the classified arena.
We're confident that our growth strategies, together with our strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy, position us well to drive value for shareholders. We'll end this year on a strong note, well prepared and energized to drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio into 2016.
We provided our initial outlook in the release this morning. We'll release our guidance and provide further perspective for 2016 at an upcoming Investor Day, which we will be hosting in New York City on Tuesday, December 8.
So I'm going to turn it over to Ralph now for some more details on the financials and then we'll be back and take your questions. So with that, Ralph?"

I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. 
We had a strong operational performance in the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, which was better than what our outlook was for the third quarter. It was driven primarily by higher operating margin as well as lower taxes, which more than offset softer-than-expected sales. Free cash flow was $263 million for the quarter and also very solid.
Adjusted diluted EPS excludes gains and losses on business divestitures and the noncash NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter's consolidated sales were $2,817,000,000 and declined 1% organically. Sales were about $130 million left in our third quarter guidance, and that was due to delays and reductions in international and commercial business.
NSS had another disappointing quarter and missed a plan again, primarily due to continued delays in converting higher-margin international and commercial business, which had similarly impacted NSS's first half results. A smaller negative impact for NSS has been tasking delays on various DoD ID/IQ contract vehicles. As a result, we reassessed and reduced NSS's future outlook for sales and operating margins, and this triggered the NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter operating margins were better than we anticipated in every other segment, with margins for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems moving higher and exhibiting the improvement trends which we've been articulating. 
Aerospace Systems margin rebounded sharply from the second quarter, and it benefited from some items that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter or next year. 
In the ISR systems sector, we had sales volume and better contract performance on 3 large international contracts that are nearing completion, and those raised margin over 200 basis points for the segment.
In the logistics solutions sector, we received an $8 million request for equitable adjustment to recover a portion of the prior year cost overruns on a previous Army C-12 contract, which raised margin another 80 basis points for the segment. Excluding these items, Aerospace Systems third quarter margin would have been less than 7%. 
With respect to our 2015 guidance update, we tightened our adjusted EPS range and maintained the midpoint at $6.85. The lower operating income expectation for NSS is being offset by a combination of higher margin than the other segments and a lower tax rate.
We also reduced our consolidated sales at the midpoint by $100 million to $11,450,000,000, and that's due to the international and commercial sales trend that I talked about a few minutes ago, which mostly impacts Electronic Systems and NSS. And we also reduced consolidated operating margin by a modest 10 basis points to 8.3%.
We maintained our free cash flow estimate of $850 million for the year. And with respect to our capital allocation, we are assuming $740 million of share repurchases for 2015 after shifting $60 million to pay for the ForceX acquisition earlier this month. We still plan to repay $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter.
And for the last point on the 2015 guidance, we now expect the book-to-bill ratio for the year to be approximately 0.97. And that, again, is due to the lower expected international and commercial orders that I talked about, which will impact 2016 sales. 
So scrolling forward to our preliminary outlook for 2016, we expect consolidated sales to decline about 3% to $11.1 billion. And this estimate assumes an organic sales decline of about 1.5%. The major change since we last discussed the 2016 sales trends, again, is that now we expect international sales to decline about 15% in 2016 versus 2015. 
We still expect our U.S. Government sales, including the DoD, to be flat organically versus '15, and commercial sales are expected to grow about 7%. 
With respect to the international sales, I'd like to add that we continue to expect foreign military business to be a long-term growth driver for L-3. However, as you know, the international business is inherently lumpy and less predictable than the U.S. DoD business and international is growing at a very nice pace over the last several years. It's going to take a pause in 2016 before we start to grow it again after next year. At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth to be 1% to 2% for Electronic Systems, and that will be offset by declines of about 4% for each of Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems. 
For operating margin, we expect consolidated margin to increase 80 basis points to about 9.1% next year, with the margins increasing in all 4 segments.
The margin progressions are on target for Electronic Systems to the mid-12% range and for Communication Systems to the low 10% range. However, margins are below our objectives for Aerospace Systems and NSS. 
With respect to Aerospace Systems, the margin for next year is expected to be in the low 6% range. And it's a very different story when you look at the 3 sectors in Aerospace Systems. So ISR Systems sector will have margins for 2016 that will continue to be very solid at about 10%, but they will decline versus 2015 due to those lower international sales and those contracts ending that I talked about earlier, as well as the final run-off in the Afghanistan drawdown sales. 
Aircraft Systems sector margins will swing to profitability in 2016 following the head of state aircraft losses that we incurred in the first half of 2015. But those margins are only going to improve to about 3%. And last week, logistics solutions margin will remain about 2%, as it continues to wrestle with pricing pressures, LPTA and reduced flight hours. 
The tax rate for next year is expected to be 31%, and that assumes no federal or any tax credit. And you could be sure that we're tasking our tax advice -- tax advice is to drive that rate down again like we did in 2016 -- 2015. 
With respect to free cash flow, we expect it to be at $850 million for 2016, the same as it is expected to be for 2015. And what's happening there is that higher operating income is being offset by larger income tax payments due to the tax rate going up. Our planned share repurchases for 2016 start at $500 million. And all of these items that I just discussed for next year, in terms of the outlook, calculate to EPS of about $7.25 for 2016.
So to conclude with my financial review, L-3 is in the process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance and margin expansion and making good progress, especially in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. We are also transforming our portfolio of businesses to strengthen the company and enhance our financial performance. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. 
We acknowledge that we have work to do. We can do better and we will. And finally, I'd also like to say that I look forward to working with Chris, and I'm pleased that he joined L-3. 
With that, thank you. And we'll go to the Q&A."

Sure, Rob. Well, a good example of expanding the 2 acquisitions we did this year, the CTC one, which took the existing simulator hardware business and now built that out to not only include the sale of the device or the simulator to potential customers, but the potential to sell training by the hour, which we're hearing customers asking for more and more every day. And it's a very compelling business model when you look at it in terms of the margins it delivers and our capacity to be able to deliver that globally. You couple that with the demand for pilots over the next 10 to 20 years and it looks like a very good story for us, being able to not only deliver a state of the art devices, but wrapping the service element around that of trainers has made it a very strong business for us, and we look forward to that growing over the future. On top of that, the ForceX is a good example, again, of taking an existing leading product, our EO/IR chart, which is on virtually every manned and unmanned platform that has an EO/IR chart. And baking into that, software capability to do more analytical work on the data that the sensor gathers. So not just providing raw imagery, if you will, but it's actually providing actionable information and putting the processing capacity on the platform and getting it off the ground, if you will. So getting quicker information into the hands of the war fighter. So that also will expand the market by taking an existing product and expanding its capability. We also have an installed base of those products, which gives us a ready market to go out and provide upgrades to. On the margin side, you asked how can we expand margins. Well, one, by targeting businesses at our acquisition program that are in better margins or have that potential, but also working through our portfolio of businesses with an eye towards either consolidation or other forms of cost takeout, whether it's in the facility area, better supply-chain management, overall better program execution is kind of an obvious one there. But generally, the entire cost model is being challenged at virtually every business units. So we've been very clear with our leadership teams at all our groups and divisions that margin expansion is going to be a criteria that they're going to be measured on. And we've been very happy with the response that we've been getting from them. They understand it and are being very responsive to us."

So we booked a large sat com terminal order earlier this year for Australia, which was about $80 million. And we're going to -- we expect to ship that order this year. And while we do see follow-ons there, we won't get the next order until late in 2016 or early in 2017. So that's going to cause an $80 million drop in international sales in Communication Systems segment. And that's when the items affecting the international profile I just talked about with respect to a previous question from Rob. And then secondly, within Communication Systems, we do about $300 million a year or so on power devices or TWTs that are used in a variety of platforms, including in satellites. And there's been a slow down in new commercial satellite orders this year, or I think there's only 7 about or so that have been ordered year-to-date, which compares to a normal year of about 20 or so SATs. And for that reason, we expect to have about a $60 million to $70 million sales decline next year in that business, in the TWT business, which is in Communication Systems. And that's also affecting the sales next year. And what that is offsetting is growth in the DoD business, especially in broadband comps or comps systems West. And that business has been recovering very nicely the last 1.5 year or so. We overcame the European implementation issues that we had there the last couple of years. And it looks like it's going to be on a nice growth path going forward the next several years. So that's what's happening in comp systems, Cai."

We've been through, as we've been saying, top to bottom review of the entire portfolio with our board this fall. And again, with the objectives we've been talking about, businesses where we have significant competitive discriminators, which are typically for us in the electronic space, and then had good profiles for future growth and margin expansion. And businesses that didn't fit that profile are being looked at more carefully with an eye towards potentially divesting. So in terms of timing, I would say we're looking at over the next year or so. This is a process that we look at regularly, and it will necessarily change as things change around us. We'll adopt or adapt to those changes and adopt whatever strategies we think are necessary at the time to ensure our continued margin expansion and growth. But in terms of size, I really can't give you a number off the top of my head in terms of sales volume. But to tell you that everything that you would think of that is performing below our composite in margins is being looked at carefully. It's not just by numbers, if you will. I mean, there's a little more that goes into the analysis. It's the future growth rate where the customers are going to require in the future, what the requirements are going to be in technology, et cetera, et cetera.

And I think he's a great fit culturally, knows our business as one would expect. Set a very capable hands to add to Ralph and myself that is on the same page in terms of the things we need to get accomplished here to move the company forward."

Well, first of all, in terms of the incentives, the answer is yes since we are trying to encourage that behavior of margin expansion and cost control. We are baking that into some of the measures that we have going forward. Even though we might say that while they're EPS or TSR-centric, they'll still include those elements. But if you look at the -- what the plan will be that it's going through the basis for an incentive agreement built into that plan will be a reasonable level of margin expansion. So in that sense, yes, it's in there. And it's always been in there to some degree. Each successive plan has had some level of margin expansion. It's just that it's becoming more of a focal point going forward. And then in terms of L-3 structurally, I've been very mindful and careful not to take some of the very things that have made the company successful in the past and throw that away. The decentralize structure, in many regards, works well. We do think that a little bit more control, centralized sense could make -- could be appropriate at this point in the life of the company that we do want to make sure we have the strongest oversight in place that we can have over our business units, and that's done in conjunction with our group presidents. But the answer is no, we still intend to have a significant level of economy in our business unit level. We believe that, that decision making is made best when it's done closest to the customer, but as long as it's done within the parameters that we lay out for our people. And with that in mind, I think adding Chris and his experience to the team will kind of enhance that whole process."

However, if you look at where the U.S. service people are operating, it's all over the world. And logistics happens to be a discriminator that makes that possible. It's a key enabler for our military. It's having a very robust logistics environment around them. So it's something that I think may get renewed focus by the DoD. But again, we here are focused on doing whatever it is we need to do to drive value. So it's the whole package, whether it's margin, top line growth, the combination of the 2. So it's all in the table. And we will take those actions, George. 
So just in concluding, moving forward, we plan -- we believe the actions that we have taken and the plans we put in place reflect our customer's priorities and give us a clear path to significantly improve our revenue and earnings performance over time. At its core, our strategy for discipline growth is simple and straightforward. We are repositioning our portfolio and investing in our businesses, our people and our technologies, as well as levering our cash flow generation to maintain market leadership in our core businesses and return cash to our shareholders. 
We're focused on higher return businesses in markets where we maintain leading positions. We're excited about L-3's progress and prospects for enhancing and expanding our defense electronics, ISR and communications businesses, areas where we have market-leading positions and that represent the core of L-3. 
We're committed to long-term strategic growth and performance, and we'll continue to work to deliver value for all shareholders.

And thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call. 
Overall we had solid operating results with higher operating margins in our Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. We also continue to make good progress on the divestiture of our national security solutions business and expect to make an announcement by year-end. This quarter, we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment charge related to NSS. Ralph will provide more details on that charge in his remarks. 
Yesterday, as I'm sure you've seen, we announced that Chris Chubasik has joined L-3 as President and COO. Chris has over 30 years of operational experience in the aerospace and defense industry and is a terrific addition to our already strong leadership team, and we're all very pleased to have him at L-3. These actions reflect our commitment to positioning our portfolio to sharpen our focus on our higher returning electronics communications and ISR businesses where we have market-leading positions. These are areas that are critical to the security of our nation. 
Further, we continue to evaluate our portfolio for additional opportunities to improve our strategic position and create value for our shareholders. As we have stated, we're looking to focus on businesses with stronger margin profiles and higher returns in markets where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. We expect to redeploy capital generated by these and future strategic initiatives into our existing portfolio as well as the fund acquisitions that drive stronger returns.
While we continue to face certain macro challenges, we are laser-focused on execution and investing in areas that will improve the overall performance of our portfolio. In many areas of our business, our efforts are yielding positive results, as reflected in some important contract wins in the quarter, and we have successfully expanded our customer base. 
Turning to our third quarter results, we had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the 2014 third quarter.
We delivered strong bottom line performance, thanks to our continued focus on pursuing higher margin business and disciplined cost management. Our consolidated segment operating positions are improving and are better than expected at 10.2% for the quarter, and we're pleased about that. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.4 billion, which was a slight decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $9.4 billion of funded backlog, with a book-to-bill ratio for the quarter of about 0.86 and 0.98 year-to-date.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $317 million, most of which we returned to shareholders.
We repurchased $259 million of our stock in the quarter and paid $52 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $800 million in cash to shareholders.
Before I go through our wins for the quarter, I'd like to give an update on other key business items across the company. Our progress on the head-of-state programs continues to meet our estimates and schedules as discussed on our second quarter call. Earlier this week, we successfully completed a key customer checkout flight. Our progress has been very encouraging. The new management team we put in place has been very focused on the program and we're seeing the results of their efforts every day.
Operationally, we're also taking steps to improve program performance and to create value for customers through continued investments in R&D and new technology development. As an example of our R&D efforts, our focus on innovation helped us secure our broadband communications systems contract for the Apache helicopter. This was a case where we devised a technology enhancement on behalf of our customer and delivered an unprecedented command and control capability. This is an area where I would call it thought leadership for our team, where we identified a potential solution for our customer and developed it on our own that really enables an unprecedented man-to-unmanned teaming capacity that, up until now, has not been available. So we're very proud of that accomplishment and the customer is very happy with the solution.
In terms of M&A, our goal is to complement L-3's existing business with new acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. Our recent acquisition of ForceX is a great example of that. We've worked with this company for 7 years and it adds new capabilities and customers, which allows us to compete in broader markets.
ForceX specializes in the processing, exploitation and dissemination of information. This technology enables a rapid decision-making ability from the data collected by our sensor. This complements our wide-area imagery and sensor expertise that we will be able to integrate ForceX software into our existing EO/IR sensors, cards and subsystems. In short, we've transformed L-3 from a sensor supplier to an information supplier in a very strategic ISR market area. Plus this also creates software upgrade opportunities with our installed base of thousands of L-3 sensor products.
In addition, our acquisition of CTC earlier this year has continued to prove a strong fit. As we discussed last quarter, the commercial aviation training market is enjoying record demand for professionally trained pilots and forecasts show that over 550,000 pilots will be required in the next 20 years. The combined CTC aviation and Link U.K. businesses are performing well, and the synergies between these 2 companies are benefiting customers around the world. We've had unanimously positive responses from our customers and industry on this new capability. As a result, we've expanded pilot training in our sensor in Thailand and are developing our business in the U.K. We're now providing training on our A320 and 737 simulators at the recently launched Crawley training facility outside of Gatwick Airport in London with plans to expand our position in this market.
This is a great example of our M&A strategy and we are actively looking at acquiring businesses that will meet our criteria for both margin expansion and top line growth and enhance our existing portfolio of market-leading technologies.
Finally, I'm very pleased to report that we've been recognized once again with Cogswell Awards for outstanding industrial security practices at 3 L-3 facilities. We insist on the highest standards in all aspects of our operations, and we're honored to receive these awards. Our approach in this area has been to make our industrial security program a business discriminator as it continues to become more important in our current environment. 
Now I'd like to discuss some of the wins we've had across our defense, commercial aviation and international businesses.
So on the defense side, we were focused on DoD priority areas, including ISR communications, sensors and the classified space. With regard to the defense budget, while we continue to believe that we are nearing the end of an extended period of uncertainty, we're experiencing a delay in the anticipated DoD budget uptick. However, the bipartisan budget agreement provides 2 years of funding with an increase of $38 billion in fiscal '16 from the '15 DoD budget. This is a good fit for L-3, as it enables our long-term planning ability and advances the contract award process. We also have quick reaction capabilities that are sought after as well as ISR in upgrade, maintenance and weapon systems sustainment expertise.
The agreement will facilitate this work and is expected to translate into increased activity from programs that we already support. In the third quarter, we received some strategic awards that will further grow our business. As I mentioned earlier, we've been selected to provide our broadband comps system for the U.S. Army's Apache helicopter. This was a major win for us where we designed and spiral- developed a new solution based on an earlier combat proof of design. This is what I just described where it's a manned-unmanned teaming expertise.
It's known as MUM-TX [ph]. And under that program, we will provide the Apache with its first-ever video and broadband data transmission with multiple universal unmanned platforms.
We were also awarded a contract to missionize 2 C-130 aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard with options to missionize 10 additional C-130 aircraft and provide ground flight test support for them. This is a great program win for our team at Waco.
We were selected to supply our key management infrastructure for the intelligence community as part of the last mile portable key loader program. This is a 10-year program that extends our leadership position and information assurance. 
This quarter, we earned a spot on 2 ID/IQ contracts, the U.S. Air Force's TSA 3 and Agile acquisition programs. 
Finally, in our military simulation business, we received a contract extension for our C-17 simulation program. 
For commercial aviation, we're at the beginning of a growth cycle driven primarily by expansions in developing regions and low-cost carriers, with Asia dominating. It's predicted that the worldwide fleet size will more than double in the next 20 years. 
As air transport OEMs continue to forecast increased production rates, directives such as the 2020 ADS-B out mandate continue to drive growth in the U.S. and in Europe. We have a strong commercial aviation business and we have increased our efforts to capitalize on opportunities in this market.
In our training business, Boeing ordered its first 787 RealitySeven full flight simulator. We also received notification that we have been selected by 2 airlines and an OEM for new simulators. These sales will represent a major step in expanding our base in strategically important regions.
In aviation security, we're concentrating on upgrading our technology and recently received funding from the TSA for software development and algorithms for our examiner systems as well as an order from France for our check bagger systems. The use of our ProVision system continues to expand globally. We are participating in key product demonstrations at several airports in Japan, aimed at the adoption of systems there. 
In addition, our new CLEAR scan system for carry-on baggage will soon be deployed at major -- at a major international airport. Now this is another example of our folks identifying a solution that they believe it will be widely accepted. Everybody knows how troubling it is to have liquids taken out of your carry-on bags or having to take out computers and turn them on. What we've been able to do, utilizing computed tomography or CT and advanced algorithm -- detection algorithms, we've been able to allow travelers to leave liquids and electronics in their bags as they make their way through security checkpoints. And the system will detect whether there's a bad substance or energetic material that doesn't belong there. So as we all know, using the machine to do the detection is a heck of a lot more efficient and should keep lines moving better and provide much better detection capability.
In the international space, part of our strategy is growing our international sales, which we know can be a lumpy business, but it still remains a focus area for us. I'd like to highlight a few of the wins we had during the quarter. 
Our integrated platform management system was selected by the Royal Canadian Navy as part of a major vessel conversion project. We achieved the first international sale of our CATAPAN Global encryption product. This marks an important win for our encryption business as we continue to support the secure communication requirements for a variety of international government customers. 
We also received continued funding of legacy programs, including Argentina C-130 and the U.K. Airseeker program.
Now let's turn to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We have positive momentum as we move into the fourth quarter and are capitalizing on this with solid execution and program performance. We continue to explore possible additions to the L-3 portfolio that we believe are a good fit and that further strengthen our core business, improve margin and sales profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company.
Our goal is to expand our market share, extend our product offerings and capabilities, attract new customers and, of course, grow shareholder value.
We also remain committed to investing in R&D and are encouraged that our investments are paying dividends. We target key areas to keep our technology portfolio fresh and relevant and will continue to invest in this critical area going forward. 
That said, L-3 is well-positioned in several DoD priority areas, including persistent ISR and protective communications, unmanned systems, space and the classified arena.
We're confident that our growth strategies, together with our strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy, position us well to drive value for shareholders. We'll end this year on a strong note, well prepared and energized to drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio into 2016.
We provided our initial outlook in the release this morning. We'll release our guidance and provide further perspective for 2016 at an upcoming Investor Day, which we will be hosting in New York City on Tuesday, December 8.
So I'm going to turn it over to Ralph now for some more details on the financials and then we'll be back and take your questions. So with that, Ralph?"
93538,314949083,886039,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. We had a strong operational performance in the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, wh",1194,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. 
We had a strong operational performance in the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, which was better than what our outlook was for the third quarter. It was driven primarily by higher operating margin as well as lower taxes, which more than offset softer-than-expected sales. Free cash flow was $263 million for the quarter and also very solid.
Adjusted diluted EPS excludes gains and losses on business divestitures and the noncash NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter's consolidated sales were $2,817,000,000 and declined 1% organically. Sales were about $130 million left in our third quarter guidance, and that was due to delays and reductions in international and commercial business.
NSS had another disappointing quarter and missed a plan again, primarily due to continued delays in converting higher-margin international and commercial business, which had similarly impacted NSS's first half results. A smaller negative impact for NSS has been tasking delays on various DoD ID/IQ contract vehicles. As a result, we reassessed and reduced NSS's future outlook for sales and operating margins, and this triggered the NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter operating margins were better than we anticipated in every other segment, with margins for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems moving higher and exhibiting the improvement trends which we've been articulating. 
Aerospace Systems margin rebounded sharply from the second quarter, and it benefited from some items that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter or next year. 
In the ISR systems sector, we had sales volume and better contract performance on 3 large international contracts that are nearing completion, and those raised margin over 200 basis points for the segment.
In the logistics solutions sector, we received an $8 million request for equitable adjustment to recover a portion of the prior year cost overruns on a previous Army C-12 contract, which raised margin another 80 basis points for the segment. Excluding these items, Aerospace Systems third quarter margin would have been less than 7%. 
With respect to our 2015 guidance update, we tightened our adjusted EPS range and maintained the midpoint at $6.85. The lower operating income expectation for NSS is being offset by a combination of higher margin than the other segments and a lower tax rate.
We also reduced our consolidated sales at the midpoint by $100 million to $11,450,000,000, and that's due to the international and commercial sales trend that I talked about a few minutes ago, which mostly impacts Electronic Systems and NSS. And we also reduced consolidated operating margin by a modest 10 basis points to 8.3%.
We maintained our free cash flow estimate of $850 million for the year. And with respect to our capital allocation, we are assuming $740 million of share repurchases for 2015 after shifting $60 million to pay for the ForceX acquisition earlier this month. We still plan to repay $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter.
And for the last point on the 2015 guidance, we now expect the book-to-bill ratio for the year to be approximately 0.97. And that, again, is due to the lower expected international and commercial orders that I talked about, which will impact 2016 sales. 
So scrolling forward to our preliminary outlook for 2016, we expect consolidated sales to decline about 3% to $11.1 billion. And this estimate assumes an organic sales decline of about 1.5%. The major change since we last discussed the 2016 sales trends, again, is that now we expect international sales to decline about 15% in 2016 versus 2015. 
We still expect our U.S. Government sales, including the DoD, to be flat organically versus '15, and commercial sales are expected to grow about 7%. 
With respect to the international sales, I'd like to add that we continue to expect foreign military business to be a long-term growth driver for L-3. However, as you know, the international business is inherently lumpy and less predictable than the U.S. DoD business and international is growing at a very nice pace over the last several years. It's going to take a pause in 2016 before we start to grow it again after next year. At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth to be 1% to 2% for Electronic Systems, and that will be offset by declines of about 4% for each of Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems. 
For operating margin, we expect consolidated margin to increase 80 basis points to about 9.1% next year, with the margins increasing in all 4 segments.
The margin progressions are on target for Electronic Systems to the mid-12% range and for Communication Systems to the low 10% range. However, margins are below our objectives for Aerospace Systems and NSS. 
With respect to Aerospace Systems, the margin for next year is expected to be in the low 6% range. And it's a very different story when you look at the 3 sectors in Aerospace Systems. So ISR Systems sector will have margins for 2016 that will continue to be very solid at about 10%, but they will decline versus 2015 due to those lower international sales and those contracts ending that I talked about earlier, as well as the final run-off in the Afghanistan drawdown sales. 
Aircraft Systems sector margins will swing to profitability in 2016 following the head of state aircraft losses that we incurred in the first half of 2015. But those margins are only going to improve to about 3%. And lastly, logistics solutions margin will remain about 2%, as it continues to wrestle with pricing pressures, LPTA and reduced flight hours. 
The tax rate for next year is expected to be 31%, and that assumes no federal or any tax credit. And you could be sure that we're tasking our tax advice -- tax advice is to drive that rate down again like we did in 2016 -- 2015. 
With respect to free cash flow, we expect it to be $850 million for 2016, the same as it is expected to be for 2015. And what's happening there is that higher operating income is being offset by larger income tax payments due to the tax rate going up. Our planned share repurchases for 2016 start at $500 million. And all of these items that I just discussed for next year, in terms of the outlook, calculate to EPS of about $7.25 for 2016.
So to conclude with my financial review, L-3 is in the process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance and margin expansion and making good progress, especially in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. We are also transforming our portfolio of businesses to strengthen the company and enhance our financial performance. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. 
We acknowledge that we have work to do. We can do better and we will. And finally, I'd also like to say that I look forward to working with Chris, and I'm pleased that he joined L-3. 
With that, thank you. And we'll go to the Q&A."

Sure, Rob. Well, a good example of expanding the 2 acquisitions we did this year, the CTC one, which took the existing simulator hardware business and now built that out to not only include the sale of the device or the simulator to potential customers, but the potential to sell training by the hour, which we're hearing customers asking for more and more every day. And it's a very compelling business model when you look at it in terms of the margins it delivers and our capacity to be able to deliver that globally. You couple that with the demand for pilots over the next 10 to 20 years and it looks like a very good story for us, being able to not only deliver state of the art devices, but wrapping the service element around that of trainers has made it a very strong business for us, and we look forward to that growing over the future. On top of that, the ForceX is a good example, again, of taking an existing leading product, our EO/IR chart, which is on virtually every manned and unmanned platform that has an EO/IR chart. And baking into that, the software capability to do more analytical work on the data that the sensor gathers. So not just providing raw imagery, if you will, but it's actually providing actionable information and putting the processing capacity on the platform and getting it off the ground, if you will. So getting quicker information into the hands of the war fighter. So that also will expand the market by taking an existing product and expanding its capability. We also have an installed base of those products, which gives us a ready market to go out and provide upgrades to. On the margin side, you asked how can we expand margins. Well, one, by targeting businesses at our acquisition program that earn better margins or have that potential, but also working through our portfolio of businesses with an eye towards either consolidation or other forms of cost takeout, whether it's in the facility area, better supply-chain management, overall better program execution is kind of an obvious one there. But generally, the entire cost model is being challenged at virtually every business unit. So we've been very clear with our leadership teams at all our groups and divisions that margin expansion is going to be a criteria that they're going to be measured on. And we've been very happy with the response that we've been getting from them. They understand it and are being very responsive to us."

So we booked a large sat com terminal order earlier this year for Australia, which was about $80 million. And we're going to -- we expect to ship all that order this year. And while we do see follow-ons there, we won't get the next order until late in 2016 or early in 2017. So that's going to cause an $80 million drop in international sales in Communication Systems segment. And that's one of the items affecting the international profile I just talked about with respect to the previous question from Rob. And then secondly, within Communication Systems, we do about $300 million a year or so on power devices or TWTs that are used in a variety of platforms, including in satellites. And there's been a slowdown in new commercial satellite orders this year, where I think there's only 7 about or so that have been ordered year-to-date, which compares to a normal year of about 20 or so SATs. And for that reason, we expect to have about a $60 million to $70 million sales decline next year in that business, in the TWT business, which is in Communication Systems. And that's also affecting the sales next year. And what that is offsetting is growth in the DoD business, especially in broadband comms or comms systems West. And that business has been recovering very nicely the last 1.5 year or so. We overcame the European implementation issues that we had there the last couple of years. And it looks like it's going to be on a nice growth path going forward the next several years. So that's what's happening in comp systems, Cai."

And again, with the objectives we've been talking about, businesses where we have significant competitive discriminators, which are typically for us in the electronic space, and then had good profiles for future growth and margin expansion. And businesses that didn't fit that profile are being looked at more carefully with an eye towards potentially divesting. So in terms of timing, I would say we're looking at over the next year or so. This is a process that we look at regularly, and it will necessarily change as things change around us. We'll adopt or adapt to those changes and adopt whatever strategies we think are necessary at the time to ensure our continued margin expansion and growth. But in terms of size, I really can't give you a number off the top of my head in terms of sales volume. But to tell you that everything that you would think of that is performing below our composite in margins is being looked at carefully. It's not just paint-by-numbers, if you will.

It's the future growth rate, what the customers are going to require in the future, what the requirements are going to be for technology, et cetera, et cetera.

The areas we've been focusing on are areas where we're encouraged by what we're seeing in the budget, in terms of more clarity and what the future funding is going to be. But I'm not really going to take it down to a program level at this point, because there's just too many moving parts right now. And as you also probably noticed, the good piece of the increase in the budget is really going towards some of the newer platforms. And while we do enjoy content on many of those platforms, they're just not drivers for our entire business. We're more driven by, again, persistent ISR, effective comms, night vision, SOCOM requirements, et cetera. So those are areas where we've been very encouraged by everything we've seen so far."

Well, first of all, talk to the incentives, the answer is yes since we are trying to encourage that behavior of margin expansion and cost control. We are baking that into some of the measures that we have going forward. Even though you might say that well, they're EPS or TSR-centric, they'll still include those elements. But if you look at the -- what the plan will be that it's going through the basis for an incentive agreement built into that plan will be a reasonable level of margin expansion. So in that sense, yes, it's in there. And it's always been in there, by the way, to some degree. Each successive plan has had some level of margin expansion. It's just that it's becoming more of a focal point going forward. And then in terms of L-3 structurally, I've been very mindful and careful not to take some of the very things that have made the company successful in the past and throw that away. The decentralized structure, in many regards, works well. We do think that a little bit more control, centralized sense could make -- could be appropriate at this point in the life of the company that we do want to make sure we have the strongest oversight in place that we can have over our business units, and that's done in conjunction with our group presidents. But the answer is no, we still intend to have a significant level of autonomy in our business unit level. We believe that, that decision making is made best when it's done closest to the customer, but as long as it's done within the parameters that we lay out for our people.

However, if you look at where the U.S. service people are operating, it's all over the world. And logistics happens to be a discriminator that makes that possible. It's a key enabler for our military. It's having a very robust logistics environment around them. So it's something that I think may get renewed focus by the DoD. But again, we here are focused on doing whatever it is we need to do to drive value. So it's the whole package, whether it's margin, top line growth, the combination of the 2. So it's all in the table. And we will take those actions, George. 
So just in concluding, moving forward, we plan -- we believe the actions that we have taken and the plans we put in place reflect our customer's priorities and give us a clear path to significantly improve our revenue and earnings performance over time. At its core, our strategy for discipline growth is simple and straightforward. We are repositioning our portfolio and investing in our businesses, our people and our technologies, as well as levering our cash flow generation to maintain market leadership in our core businesses and return cash to our shareholders. 
We're focused on higher return businesses in markets where we maintain leading positions. We're excited about L-3's progress and prospects for enhancing and expanding our defense electronics, ISR and communications businesses, areas where we have market-leading positions and that represent the core of L-3. 
We're committed to long-term strategic growth and performance, and we'll continue to work to deliver value for all shareholders. As I've mentioned a couple of times now, we plan on hosting an Investor Day in New York on December 8. We will provide additional color and detail in our strategy, our ongoing business transformation and our key initiatives for 2016. And I look forward to seeing you all there and continuing this dialogue. And our board will be there. Many of the members of the board will be present as well. So thanks again for joining us this morning and on the call. And we look forward to speaking to you in a couple of weeks. Thank you."

Overall we had solid operating results with higher operating margins in our Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. We",2182,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you. And thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call. 
Overall we had solid operating results with higher operating margins in our Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. We also continue to make good progress on the divestiture of our national security solutions business and expect to make an announcement by year-end. This quarter, we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment charge related to NSS. Ralph will provide more details on that charge in his remarks. 
Yesterday, as I'm sure you've seen, we announced that Chris Chubasik has joined L-3 as President and COO. Chris has over 30 years of operational experience in the aerospace and defense industry and is a terrific addition to our already strong leadership team, and we're all very pleased to have him at L-3. These actions reflect our commitment to positioning our portfolio to sharpen our focus on our higher returning electronics communications and ISR businesses where we have market-leading positions. These are areas that are critical to the security of our nation. 
Further, we continue to evaluate our portfolio for additional opportunities to improve our strategic position and create value for our shareholders. As we have stated, we're looking to focus on businesses with stronger margin profiles and higher returns in markets where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. We expect to redeploy capital generated by these and future strategic initiatives into our existing portfolio as well as the fund acquisitions that drive stronger returns.
While we continue to face certain macro challenges, we are laser-focused on execution and investing in areas that will improve the overall performance of our portfolio. In many areas of our business, our efforts are yielding positive results, as reflected in some important contract wins in the quarter, and we have successfully expanded our customer base. 
Turning to our third quarter results, we had net sales of $2.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the 2014 third quarter.
We delivered strong bottom line performance, thanks to our continued focus on pursuing higher margin business and disciplined cost management. Our consolidated segment operating positions are improving and are better than expected at 10.2% for the quarter, and we're pleased about that. Funded orders for the quarter were $2.4 billion, which was a slight decrease year-over-year. And we ended the quarter with about $9.4 billion of funded backlog, with a book-to-bill ratio for the quarter of about 0.86 and 0.98 year-to-date.
During the quarter, we generated net cash from operating activities of $317 million, most of which we returned to shareholders.
We repurchased $259 million of our stock in the quarter and paid $52 million in dividends. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $800 million in cash to shareholders.
Before I go through our wins for the quarter, I'd like to give an update on other key business items across the company. Our progress on the head-of-state programs continues to meet our estimates and schedules as discussed on our second quarter call. Earlier this week, we successfully completed a key customer checkout flight. Our progress has been very encouraging. The new management team we put in place has been very focused on the program and we're seeing the results of their efforts every day.
Operationally, we're also taking steps to improve program performance and to create value for customers through continued investments in R&D and new technology development. As an example of our R&D efforts, our focus on innovation helped us secure our broadband communications systems contract for the Apache helicopter. This was a case where we devised a technology enhancement on behalf of our customer and delivered an unprecedented command and control capability. This is an area where I would call it thought leadership for our team, where we identified a potential solution for our customer and developed it on our own that really enables an unprecedented man-to-unmanned teaming capacity that, up until now, has not been available. So we're very proud of that accomplishment and the customer is very happy with the solution.
In terms of M&A, our goal is to complement L-3's existing business with new acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. Our recent acquisition of ForceX is a great example of that. We've worked with this company for 7 years and it adds new capabilities and customers, which allows us to compete in broader markets.
ForceX specializes in the processing, exploitation and dissemination of information. This technology enables a rapid decision-making ability from the data collected by our sensor. This complements our wide-area imagery and sensor expertise that we will be able to integrate ForceX software into our existing EO/IR sensors, cards and subsystems. In short, we've transformed L-3 from a sensor supplier to an information supplier in a very strategic ISR market area. Plus this also creates software upgrade opportunities with our installed base of thousands of L-3 sensor products.
In addition, our acquisition of CTC earlier this year has continued to prove a strong fit. As we discussed last quarter, the commercial aviation training market is enjoying record demand for professionally trained pilots and forecasts show that over 550,000 pilots will be required in the next 20 years. The combined CTC aviation and Link U.K. businesses are performing well, and the synergies between these 2 companies are benefiting customers around the world. We've had unanimously positive responses from our customers and industry on this new capability. As a result, we've expanded pilot training in our sensor in Thailand and are developing our business in the U.K. We're now providing training on our A320 and 737 simulators at the recently launched Crawley training facility outside of Gatwick Airport in London with plans to expand our position in this market.
This is a great example of our M&A strategy and we are actively looking at acquiring businesses that will meet our criteria for both margin expansion and top line growth and enhance our existing portfolio of market-leading technologies.
Finally, I'm very pleased to report that we've been recognized once again with Cogswell Awards for outstanding industrial security practices at 3 L-3 facilities. We insist on the highest standards in all aspects of our operations, and we're honored to receive these awards. Our approach in this area has been to make our industrial security program a business discriminator as it continues to become more important in our current environment. 
Now I'd like to discuss some of the wins we've had across our defense, commercial aviation and international businesses.
So on the defense side, we were focused on DoD priority areas, including ISR communications, sensors and the classified space. With regard to the defense budget, while we continue to believe that we are nearing the end of an extended period of uncertainty, we're experiencing a delay in the anticipated DoD budget uptick. However, the bipartisan budget agreement provides 2 years of funding with an increase of $38 billion in fiscal '16 from the '15 DoD budget. This is a good fit for L-3, as it enables our long-term planning ability and advances the contract award process. We also have quick reaction capabilities that are sought after as well as ISR in upgrade, maintenance and weapon systems sustainment expertise.
The agreement will facilitate this work and is expected to translate into increased activity from programs that we already support. In the third quarter, we received some strategic awards that will further grow our business. As I mentioned earlier, we've been selected to provide our broadband comps system for the U.S. Army's Apache helicopter. This was a major win for us where we designed and spiral- developed a new solution based on an earlier combat proof of design. This is what I just described where it's a manned-unmanned teaming expertise.
It's known as MUM-TX [ph]. And under that program, we will provide the Apache with its first-ever video and broadband data transmission with multiple universal unmanned platforms.
We were also awarded a contract to missionize 2 C-130 aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard with options to missionize 10 additional C-130 aircraft and provide ground flight test support for them. This is a great program win for our team at Waco.
We were selected to supply our key management infrastructure for the intelligence community as part of the last mile portable key loader program. This is a 10-year program that extends our leadership position and information assurance. 
This quarter, we earned a spot on 2 ID/IQ contracts, the U.S. Air Force's TSA 3 and Agile acquisition programs. 
Finally, in our military simulation business, we received a contract extension for our C-17 simulation program. 
For commercial aviation, we're at the beginning of a growth cycle driven primarily by expansions in developing regions and low-cost carriers, with Asia dominating. It's predicted that the worldwide fleet size will more than double in the next 20 years. 
As air transport OEMs continue to forecast increased production rates, directives such as the 2020 ADS-B out mandate continue to drive growth in the U.S. and in Europe. We have a strong commercial aviation business and we have increased our efforts to capitalize on opportunities in this market.
In our training business, Boeing ordered its first 787 RealitySeven full flight simulator. We also received notification that we have been selected by 2 airlines and an OEM for new simulators. These sales will represent a major step in expanding our base in strategically important regions.
In aviation security, we're concentrating on upgrading our technology and recently received funding from the TSA for software development and algorithms for our examiner systems as well as an order from France for our check bagger systems. The use of our ProVision system continues to expand globally. We are participating in key product demonstrations at several airports in Japan, aimed at the adoption of systems there. 
In addition, our new ClearScan system for carry-on baggage will soon be deployed at major -- at a major international airport. Now this is another example of our folks identifying a solution that they believe it will be widely accepted. Everybody knows how troubling it is to have liquids taken out of your carry-on bags or having to take out computers and turn them on. What we've been able to do, utilizing computed tomography or CT and advanced algorithm -- detection algorithms, we've been able to allow travelers to leave liquids and electronics in their bags as they make their way through security checkpoints. And the system will detect whether there's a bad substance or energetic material that doesn't belong there. So as we all know, using the machine to do the detection is a heck of a lot more efficient and should keep lines moving better and provide much better detection capability.
In the international space, part of our strategy is growing our international sales, which we know can be a lumpy business, but it still remains a focus area for us. I'd like to highlight a few of the wins we had during the quarter. 
Our integrated platform management system was selected by the Royal Canadian Navy as part of a major vessel conversion project. We achieved the first international sale of our CATAPAN Global encryption product. This marks an important win for our encryption business as we continue to support the secure communication requirements for a variety of international government customers. 
We also received continued funding of legacy programs, including Argentina C-130 and the U.K. Airseeker program.
Now let's turn to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We have positive momentum as we move into the fourth quarter and are capitalizing on this with solid execution and program performance. We continue to explore possible additions to the L-3 portfolio that we believe are a good fit and that further strengthen our core business, improve margin and sales profiles and generate strong cash flow for the company.
Our goal is to expand our market share, extend our product offerings and capabilities, attract new customers and, of course, grow shareholder value.
We also remain committed to investing in R&D and are encouraged that our investments are paying dividends. We target key areas to keep our technology portfolio fresh and relevant and will continue to invest in this critical area going forward. 
That said, L-3 is well-positioned in several DoD priority areas, including persistent ISR and protective communications, unmanned systems, space and the classified arena.
We're confident that our growth strategies, together with our strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy, position us well to drive value for shareholders. We'll end this year on a strong note, well prepared and energized to drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio into 2016.
We provided our initial outlook in the release this morning. We'll release our guidance and provide further perspective for 2016 at an upcoming Investor Day, which we will be hosting in New York City on Tuesday, December 8.
So I'm going to turn it over to Ralph now for some more details on the financials and then we'll be back and take your questions. So with that, Ralph?"
93538,314949083,886613,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. We had a strong operational performance in the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, wh",1194,"Thank you, Mike. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review our 2015 guidance update and the preliminary outlook for 2016. 
We had a strong operational performance in the third quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.09, which was better than what our outlook was for the third quarter. It was driven primarily by higher operating margin as well as lower taxes, which more than offset softer-than-expected sales. Free cash flow was $263 million for the quarter and also very solid.
Adjusted diluted EPS excludes gains and losses on business divestitures and the noncash NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter's consolidated sales were $2,817,000,000 and declined 1% organically. Sales were about $130 million left in our third quarter guidance, and that was due to delays and reductions in international and commercial business.
NSS had another disappointing quarter and missed a plan again, primarily due to continued delays in converting higher-margin international and commercial business, which had similarly impacted NSS's first half results. A smaller negative impact for NSS has been tasking delays on various DoD ID/IQ contract vehicles. As a result, we reassessed and reduced NSS's future outlook for sales and operating margins, and this triggered the NSS goodwill impairment charge. 
Third quarter operating margins were better than we anticipated in every other segment, with margins for Electronic Systems and Communication Systems moving higher and exhibiting the improvement trends which we've been articulating. 
Aerospace Systems margin rebounded sharply from the second quarter, and it benefited from some items that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter or next year. 
In the ISR systems sector, we had sales volume and better contract performance on 3 large international contracts that are nearing completion, and those raised margin over 200 basis points for the segment.
In the logistics solutions sector, we received an $8 million request for equitable adjustment to recover a portion of the prior year cost overruns on a previous Army C-12 contract, which raised margin another 80 basis points for the segment. Excluding these items, Aerospace Systems third quarter margin would have been less than 7%. 
With respect to our 2015 guidance update, we tightened our adjusted EPS range and maintained the midpoint at $6.85. The lower operating income expectation for NSS is being offset by a combination of higher margin than the other segments and a lower tax rate.
We also reduced our consolidated sales at the midpoint by $100 million to $11,450,000,000, and that's due to the international and commercial sales trend that I talked about a few minutes ago, which mostly impacts Electronic Systems and NSS. And we also reduced consolidated operating margin by a modest 10 basis points to 8.3%.
We maintained our free cash flow estimate of $850 million for the year. And with respect to our capital allocation, we are assuming $740 million of share repurchases for 2015 after shifting $60 million to pay for the ForceX acquisition earlier this month. We still plan to repay $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter.
And for the last point on the 2015 guidance, we now expect the book-to-bill ratio for the year to be approximately 0.97. And that, again, is due to the lower expected international and commercial orders that I talked about, which will impact 2016 sales. 
So scrolling forward to our preliminary outlook for 2016, we expect consolidated sales to decline about 3% to $11.1 billion. And this estimate assumes an organic sales decline of about 1.5%. The major change since we last discussed the 2016 sales trends, again, is that now we expect international sales to decline about 15% in 2016 versus 2015. 
We still expect our U.S. Government sales, including the DoD, to be flat organically versus '15, and commercial sales are expected to grow about 7%. 
With respect to the international sales, I'd like to add that we continue to expect foreign military business to be a long-term growth driver for L-3. However, as you know, the international business is inherently lumpy and less predictable than the U.S. DoD business and international is growing at a very nice pace over the last several years. It's going to take a pause in 2016 before we start to grow it again after next year. At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth to be 1% to 2% for Electronic Systems, and that will be offset by declines of about 4% for each of Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems. 
For operating margin, we expect consolidated margin to increase 80 basis points to about 9.1% next year, with the margins increasing in all 4 segments.
The margin progressions are on target for Electronic Systems to the mid-12% range and for Communication Systems to the low 10% range. However, margins are below our objectives for Aerospace Systems and NSS. 
With respect to Aerospace Systems, the margin for next year is expected to be in the low 6% range. And it's a very different story when you look at the 3 sectors in Aerospace Systems. So ISR Systems sector will have margins for 2016 that will continue to be very solid at about 10%, but they will decline versus 2015 due to those lower international sales and those contracts ending that I talked about earlier, as well as the final run-off in the Afghanistan drawdown sales. 
Aircraft Systems sector margins will swing to profitability in 2016 following the head of state aircraft losses that we incurred in the first half of 2015. But those margins are only going to improve to about 3%. And lastly, logistics solutions margin will remain about 2%, as it continues to wrestle with pricing pressures, LPTA and reduced flight hours. 
The tax rate for next year is expected to be 31%, and that assumes no federal or any tax credit. And you could be sure that we're tasking our tax advice -- tax advice is to drive that rate down again like we did in 2016 -- 2015. 
With respect to free cash flow, we expect it to be $850 million for 2016, the same as it is expected to be for 2015. And what's happening there is that higher operating income is being offset by larger income tax payments due to the tax rate going up. Our planned share repurchases for 2016 start at $500 million. And all of these items that I just discussed for next year, in terms of the outlook, calculate to EPS of about $7.25 for 2016.
So to conclude with my financial review, L-3 is in the process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance and margin expansion and making good progress, especially in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. We are also transforming our portfolio of businesses to strengthen the company and enhance our financial performance. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. 
We acknowledge that we have work to do. We can do better and we will. And finally, I'd also like to say that I look forward to working with Chris, and I'm pleased that he joined L-3. 
With that, thank you. And we'll go to the Q&A."

Sure, Rob. Well, a good example of expanding the 2 acquisitions we did this year, the CTC one, which took the existing simulator hardware business and now built that out to not only include the sale of the device or the simulator to potential customers, but the potential to sell training by the hour, which we're hearing customers asking for more and more every day. And it's a very compelling business model when you look at it in terms of the margins it delivers and our capacity to be able to deliver that globally. You couple that with the demand for pilots over the next 10 to 20 years and it looks like a very good story for us, being able to not only deliver state of the art devices, but wrapping the service element around that of trainers has made it a very strong business for us, and we look forward to that growing over the future. On top of that, the ForceX is a good example, again, of taking an existing leading product, our EO/IR chart, which is on virtually every manned and unmanned platform that has an EO/IR chart. And baking into that, the software capability to do more analytical work on the data that the sensor gathers. So not just providing raw imagery, if you will, but it's actually providing actionable information and putting the processing capacity on the platform and getting it off the ground, if you will. So getting quicker information into the hands of the war fighter. So that also will expand the market by taking an existing product and expanding its capability. We also have an installed base of those products, which gives us a ready market to go out and provide upgrades to. On the margin side, you asked how can we expand margins. Well, one, by targeting businesses at our acquisition program that earn better margins or have that potential, but also working through our portfolio of businesses with an eye towards either consolidation or other forms of cost takeout, whether it's in the facility area, better supply-chain management, overall better program execution is kind of an obvious one there. But generally, the entire cost model is being challenged at virtually every business unit. So we've been very clear with our leadership teams at all our groups and divisions that margin expansion is going to be a criteria that they're going to be measured on. And we've been very happy with the response that we've been getting from them. They understand it and are being very responsive to us."

And then secondly, within Communication Systems, we do about $300 million a year or so on power devices or TWTs that are used in a variety of platforms, including in satellites. And there's been a slowdown in new commercial satellite orders this year, where I think there's only 7 about or so that have been ordered year-to-date, which compares to a normal year of about 20 or so SATs. And for that reason, we expect to have about a $60 million to $70 million sales decline next year in that business, in the TWT business, which is in Communication Systems. And that's also affecting the sales next year. And what that is offsetting is growth in the DoD business, especially in broadband comms or comms systems West. And that business has been recovering very nicely the last 1.5 year or so. We overcame the European implementation issues that we had there the last couple of years. And it looks like it's going to be on a nice growth path going forward the next several years. So that's what's happening in comp systems, Cai."

And again, with the objectives we've been talking about, businesses where we have significant competitive discriminators, which are typically for us in the electronic space, and then had good profiles for future growth and margin expansion. And businesses that didn't fit that profile are being looked at more carefully with an eye towards potentially divesting. So in terms of timing, I would say we're looking at over the next year or so. This is a process that we look at regularly, and it will necessarily change as things change around us. We'll adopt or adapt to those changes and adopt whatever strategies we think are necessary at the time to ensure our continued margin expansion and growth. But in terms of size, I really can't give you a number off the top of my head in terms of sales volume. But to tell you that everything that you would think of that is performing below our composite in margins is being looked at carefully. It's not just paint-by-numbers, if you will. I mean, there's a little more that goes into the analysis. It's the future growth rate, what the customers are going to require in the future, what the requirements are going to be for technology, et cetera, et cetera.

But if you look at the -- what the plan will be that it's going through the basis for an incentive agreement built into that plan will be a reasonable level of margin expansion. So in that sense, yes, it's in there. And it's always been in there, by the way, to some degree. Each successive plan has had some level of margin expansion. It's just that it's becoming more of a focal point going forward. And then in terms of L-3 structurally, I've been very mindful and careful not to take some of the very things that have made the company successful in the past and throw that away. The decentralized structure, in many regards, works well. We do think that a little bit more control, centralized sense could make -- could be appropriate at this point in the life of the company that we do want to make sure we have the strongest oversight in place that we can have over our business units, and that's done in conjunction with our group presidents. But the answer is no, we still intend to have a significant level of autonomy in our business unit level. We believe that, that decision making is made best when it's done closest to the customer, but as long as it's done within the parameters that we lay out for our people.

But we don't expect margins to go any lower from that 2% that I talked about. In fact, we do expect that we'll be able to modestly improve them through cost takeout activities, et cetera. But it's doubtful that it can ever get to where we're moving the entire company margin-wise. And with respect to the LPTA, there's certainly a lot of talk about the pendulum swinging away from it. But all we're seeing is talk right now. And the actual RFPs and the award selection criteria, LPTA is still a -- the main criteria on a lot of these competitions. And I think it's a function of the fact that even though the budgets for the U.S. Defense Department are going to turn upward now, they're still -- we're still in a constrained situation. So there's definitely room for more budget. And we hear a lot of our elected leaders talking about that. Hopefully, they can bring that to fruition the next couple of years."

It depends on our ability to win new business, particularly in the platform integration division at Waco, to replace those head-of-state sales and also to replace the P-3 sales that have been declining for a while. And someone earlier talked about -- or asked about our conference call. And that's also a Waco program where we're doing about $80 million a year now, and that's down from about $140 million a year a few years ago. And that's because of what's been happening with respect to reducing the fleet size there. So to the extent that we can bring new business in, and we'll definitely be able to improve those margins. But that's something that we're focused on as well in terms of new business development. But that's the threshold of the question there."

It's not just going to be the margin, it's going to be the outlook for the business going forward without giving the wrong direction. If you think logistics, which keeps coming up, yes, margins have been lower. It's been hurt by competitive issues as well as the overall downward pressure on margins. However, if you look at where the U.S. service people are operating, it's all over the world. And logistics happens to be a discriminator that makes that possible. It's a key enabler for our military. It's having a very robust logistics environment around them. So it's something that I think may get renewed focus by the DoD. But again, we here are focused on doing whatever it is we need to do to drive value. So it's the whole package, whether it's margin, top line growth, the combination of the 2. So it's all in the table. And we will take those actions, George. 
So just in concluding, moving forward, we plan -- we believe the actions that we have taken and the plans we put in place reflect our customer's priorities and give us a clear path to significantly improve our revenue and earnings performance over time. At its core, our strategy for discipline growth is simple and straightforward. We are repositioning our portfolio and investing in our businesses, our people and our technologies, as well as levering our cash flow generation to maintain market leadership in our core businesses and return cash to our shareholders. 
We're focused on higher return businesses in markets where we maintain leading positions. We're excited about L-3's progress and prospects for enhancing and expanding our defense electronics, ISR and communications businesses, areas where we have market-leading positions and that represent the core of L-3. 
We're committed to long-term strategic growth and performance, and we'll continue to work to deliver value for all shareholders. As I've mentioned a couple of times now, we plan on hosting an Investor Day in New York on December 8. We will provide additional color and detail in our strategy, our ongoing business transformation and our key initiatives for 2016. And I look forward to seeing you all there and continuing this dialogue. And our board will be there. Many of the members of the board will be present as well. So thanks again for joining us this morning and on the call. And we look forward to speaking to you in a couple of weeks. Thank you."
