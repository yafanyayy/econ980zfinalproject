Good morning, and welcome to the call. In the fourth quarter, we had normalized earnings of $0.89 per share, excluding the impact of the $3.53 per share noncash impairment charge across all of our older rigs, which Stephen will discuss",536,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, and welcome to the call. 
In the fourth quarter, we had normalized earnings of $0.89 per share, excluding the impact of the $3.53 per share noncash impairment charge across all of our older rigs, which Stephen will discuss in detail later in the call. 
Our normalized earnings are generally in line with consensus estimates, but in order to provide a better indication of our operational performance, I would draw your attention to our adjusted EBITDA number of $246 million, which will be ahead of Street estimates. 
We had a strong quarter, as our entry into the ultra-deepwater market began to pay off. This strategic move has brought significant earnings growth and greater balance to Rowan. Three of our 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are now on rate, with the third ship going on rate 3 weeks earlier than we anticipated. Our last ship, Rowan Relentless, is scheduled to leave Korea as planned at the end of March. Our construction program is on schedule and under budget. I'd like to give credit to our project and operations team for a terrific execution of a well-planned newbuild program and startup. 
In the fourth quarter, our jack-up operational downtime was 1.1%, but our deepwater downtime was only 1.2%. I consider this performance exceptional, where credit lies squarely with our crews and support personnel. Our service time was approximately 7%, which is in line with our previous guidance. 
Our operating costs were at the low end of our previous guidance due to a diligent effort on cost control. Needless to say, we will continue to focus on driving down cost for all of 2015. Mark will talk more about markets around the world in a few moments. However, I want to make a few general comments. We continue to see our customers reacting to the environment, scaling back their 2015 drilling plan and consequently reducing their spending. our customers' outlooks and perspectives on the market differ, but most of them are cutting costs aggressively. Although this is a difficult environment, we have good relationships with our customers and solid contractual terms. Please rest assured that in negotiations with our customers, we will only adjust contract terms, if, as a whole, there is benefit to our shareholders through extended term or other favorable provisions. 
Rowan's financial position is sound. We have only 1 payment remaining in our $3 billion construction program, and we have been successful in maintaining our investment-grade credit rating through that program. In 2015 and early 2016, we do not expect any large capital projects, only our normal rig maintenance CapEx, which Stephen will discuss later. 
We continue to review optimal capital allocation and ways to drive shareholder value. At this point in the cycle, we believe it's most prudent to preserve liquidity and maintain our strong balance sheet. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome Stephen to Rowan. We're absolutely delighted to be working with you. 
Now I'll get -- now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Stephen will give you details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and updated guidance for 2015. Thank you for your continued investment and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

Despite the decline in market conditions in the fourth quarter, 2014 was a strong year for Rowan's contracting efforts. We received commitments for 18 of our 19 jack-ups, which we're rolling off contract by year-end. And we finalized the contract on our fourth and final newbuild drillship. In total, we added approximately $1.9 billion worth of drilling commitments during 2014. 
There's a reason that we've been in business for over 90 years. We plan, we compete, we execute and we succeed. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time for the industry. However, our current backlog positions us favorably amongst our peers to advance through 2015 towards a cycle recovery. 
Today, I'll discuss with you current trends in the jack-up and deepwater markets, including regional comments about our areas of operations. 
Worldwide jack-up utilization is currently at 79%, down from 85% in our last call and down from 88% this time last year. The decline in commodity prices was unfortunately most severe during operators' budget season, and therefore, we've all witnessed downward pressure on day rates, length of term and in the overall number of sanction projects worldwide. However, there are positives for Rowan: our experienced and confident workforce; our relatively young, highly capable fleet; our total backlog of $5.1 billion; and our solid long-standing relationship with customers around the world. These relationships have been developed over many years through mutual trust, operational excellence and safety and represent the very core of our success. The challenges are most definite for the coming year, but so is our steadfast resolve, as it has been in numerous business cycles this company has successfully navigated. 
Our ongoing negotiations with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea and the possibility of expanding our presence in West Africa are bright lights in a dim forecast for the industry. 
And now I'd like to comment on our regional jack-up operations, starting with the North Sea. All 6 of our high-spec units are operating. Three jack-ups will roll off contract in 2015, and we are currently in discussions with several operators regarding additional work. Currently, we don't anticipate any gaps between contract for our North Sea rigs. Our only scheduled downtime is 30 days of planned repairs and required inspections for the Rowan Stavanger in the second or third quarter of 2015. 
While we're hopeful to maintain high utilization in the North Sea, we expect some erosion in the commercial terms compared to our current contracts. 
In the Mediterranean, the Ralph Coffman continues operations with BG in Tunisia. We anticipate completion of the work in early July, with additional opportunities in the region. 
Now turning to the Middle East. My comments will be brief, as we are currently in negotiations with Saudi Aramco to extend the contracts on our 116-Cs in the region. We have been given every indication that Saudi Aramco intends to keep our jack-ups in their fleet. It is currently just a question of rate and term. Additionally, we are participating in Saudi Aramco's latest round of tenders requesting 3 jack-ups in the region. 
We are proud to mention this morning that 2015 marks the 10-year anniversary of our relationship with Saudi Aramco, and it is a top priority for us to strengthen this successful partnership for many years to come. 
In the Americas, we are pleased with our operations in Trinidad and are encouraged by the planning of additional projects in the region. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Joe Douglas was contracted to BHP Trinidad for approximately 4 months of work and an effective rate of 231,000 per day, with operations commencing in the third quarter this year. 
We value our relationships in the region with BP BHB, Repsol and EOG and look forward additional opportunities to work together in the coming years. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, utilization has dropped to 25%. Only 14 jack-ups are contracted, and projects are fueled in between. We haven't seen these levels since the summer of 2009. 34 jack-ups are cold stacked, with attrition expected to increase throughout the year. While we are doing our best to maneuver this well below market and meet the needs of our established customers in the region, we are actively marketing these rigs internationally. 
And finally, Southeast Asia. Two of our 4 jack-ups are currently operating. We have multiple tenders submitted to various operators. However, there continues to be a decrease in activity and an increase of new capacity in the region, making for a very competitive environment. 
As with our rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Jack-ups in this region are being actively marketed internationally into areas where more secure long-term work is built. 
I'll conclude with a few comments on the ultra-deepwater market. As Tom mentioned, we were thrilled with the commencement of our third drillship on February 1, approximately 3 weeks earlier than expected, demonstrating our leveraging of lessons learned on our previous startups. Our fourth drillship is scheduled for delivery in late March and should commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July for Freeport McMoRan. 
As a reminder, all 4 of our units are contracted into 2017 or beyond. Despite the challenges that the ultra-deepwater market is currently facing, our bill-stacked, high-specification drillships are the world's most advanced and capable rigs and are well positioned when the market recovers. 
From our research, we estimate that only 28 units are currently bill-stack equipped, with another 11 under construction. That's roughly 17% of the total ultra-deepwater fleet, and all 4 of Rowan's drillships have this superior capability. 
As such, we are confident in our ability to contract our ultra-deepwater units for follow-up projects when the time comes. 
I want to stress to you again that while we are certainly aware of the concerns of the industry, we are prepared, ready to compete and plan to successfully navigate challenges in 2015. 
We appreciate your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

This morning, I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter 2014 operating results in comparison to third quarter results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance",1593,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter 2014 operating results in comparison to third quarter results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $327 million or $2.63 per share, including a noncash pretax impairment charge of $565 [ph] million on our 12 oldest jack-up rigs versus net income of $120 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter of 2014, which included a $41 million benefit related to U.S. tax settlement. 
The fourth quarter impairment charge and the third quarter tax benefit match the substantial growth and profitability achieved by the company in the quarter. Excluding the impact of both these items, results improved substantially. We generated normalized net income of $111 million or $0.89 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $79 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $534 million or 17% higher than third quarter revenues due to the addition of our second ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Resolute, in October and the full quarter impact of drilling contracts for the Gorilla VI and Viking, following shipyard days, which concluded during the third quarter. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 7% of our available rig days during the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service dates for both jack-ups and drillships during the quarter, which we consider an excellent result. 
Looking at 2015. As you can see in our fleet status report dated February 19, we have approximately 62% [ph] of our 2015 available days contracted. All of our drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, and approximately 57% of our available jack-up days are contracted into 2015. 
Yet we also have 3 idle jack-up rigs today and an additional 13 jack-ups that have contract periods ending at various time during the year. Although we're optimistic that many of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, it is likely that some of these will experience prolonged periods of idle time. 
We've already taken steps to reduce operating costs, including our recent decision to cold-stack the Rowan Louisiana. We will continue to evaluate and eventually implement additional cost-reduction measures, as appropriate, as we progress through the year. 
Also shown in our recent fleet status report, our third ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Reliance, began operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on February 1, 3 weeks ahead of schedule. Our fourth newbuild drillship, the Rowan Relentless, is expected to be delivered at the end of the first quarter and is forecasted to commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July of this year. 
We continue to expect our operational downtime for the drillship to be less than 5% after an initial break-in period of 6 to 12 months, which operational downtime is likely to be somewhat higher. 
All in all, we do have exposure to the current relatively weak market conditions on a number of our jack-ups during 2015. Our $5.1 billion backlog of commitments, which is near an all-time high, bolsters our outlook and provides a good amount of visibility in an otherwise relatively uncertain environment. We estimate that 34% of our contract backlog will be realized over the remainder of 2015; 33% will be realized in 2016; 21% in 2017, with the balance in 2018 and beyond. 
Moving on to expenses. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $257 million, up 9% from $236 million in the third quarter, primarily due to our second ultra-deepwater drillship commencing operation and the Gorilla VI and Viking returning to service following shipyard days. 
Operating costs were also at the low end of our previous guidance, primarily due to ongoing cost control efforts. 
Looking forward for 2015. We estimate our operating expenses, excluding rebuilds, will range from $1.1 billion to $1.12 billion, an increase of 17% to 19% from the 2014 level due to the growth in drillship operating days and increased activity in Norway. 
On a net basis, the operating expenses for all our remaining rigs and shore bases are expected to decline in 2015 compared to 2014 levels. 
Our current operating cost estimate, while up from 2014 due to the growth in our business, is $30 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance due largely to the impact of our cost-reduction measures. 
First quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $275 million to $280 million. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expense totaled $34 million, which is similar to the third quarter but lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to liability-based awards and ongoing cost control efforts. 
We estimate that our 2015 SG&A expense will range from $120 million to $130 million, which represents a reduction of 4% to 12% from our previous guidance. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $31 million to $33 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled $93 million, which is higher than the third quarter level, primarily due to the addition of our second ultra-deepwater drillship in October. 
During the fourth quarter, as a result of deteriorating market conditions, we identified indicators that caused us to evaluate the book value of our assets. As a result of this impairment analysis, we determined that carrying values of our 12 oldest jack-up rigs, which were all originally constructed in the mid-1980s or earlier, were not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge in the fourth quarter, which will have the effect of reducing depreciation expense in future periods. However, as a result of this impairment analysis and other factors, we've also reduced our salvage values on all of our rigs, which will have the effect of increasing depreciation expense in future periods. 
We estimate that our 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, which, despite these changes, is largely -- is in line with our previous guidance, as the impact of our impairment charge will largely be offset by the increase attributable to lower salvage values. 
We estimate depreciation expense will range from $90 million to $92 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $30 million during the fourth quarter, which was higher than the third quarter due to lower levels of capitalized interest, following the startup of our second drillship in October. This was slightly higher than our previous guidance due to delays in newbuild capital spending, driving capitalized interest down. 
Looking forward, we expect to fund a portion of the remaining capital expenditures related to our fourth newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship with our revolving credit facility. The fourth drillship is expected to be delivered at the end of the first quarter 2015. Including the impact of this revolver draw, which we currently intend to repay with operating cash flow by the end of 2015, we estimate 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $140 million to $145 million, including $31 million to $33 million in the first quarter, which is in line with previous guidance. 
As a reminder, our interest expense will increase after our drillships are placed into service and as we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate, excluding the impact of the net tax benefits related to our asset impairment charge, was 10%, which was slightly above previous guidance due to minor changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and various discrete items. We expect our 2015 effective tax rate will range from 5% to 15%, which is a slightly wider range than our recent guidance, as a result of the greater uncertainty around our uncontracted jack-up days. 
Property and equipment additions totaled $582 million in the fourth quarter, which was nearly $100 million lower than our planned level, primarily due to the timing of certain equipment deliveries and also as a result of, but less so, cost control efforts. 
Capital expenditures related to our newbuild drillships, including mobilization, commissioning, riser gas handling, software certifications and fleet spares, totaled $518 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining capital expenditures during the fourth quarter primarily related to major rig upgrades, specifically the Gorilla VI and Vikings. 
We currently estimate our 2015 capital expenditures will range from $850 million to $875 million, with $660 million to $685 million for the final 2 newbuild drillships and related costs, which include the rig mobilizations and associated costs prior to going on rate. This is up from our previous guidance due entirely to the cost deferral from 2014. 
The remaining estimated $190 million of capital expenditures for 2015 include amounts for fleet maintenance and worldwide spares and is down 25% to 40% from our previous guidance. 
As Mark and Tom both mentioned, our industry is facing tough headwinds, but as a result of the company's solid execution of its strategic plan over the last several years, our relative position is enviable. Our operational performance is strong and improving. Our contract backlog is attractive, and our credit profile is solid. 
During this challenging period for our industry, we will continue to focus on operational execution, our excellent customer relationships, maintenance of good liquidity and a conservative balance sheet as well as opportunistic growth opportunities. 
With that, we're now prepared to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

But what we have done on the 2 rigs in Southeast Asia is we have scaled back all the released the local contract labor, and we are reducing the senior labor that lies to those rigs down to minimum safe manner levels. So we're reducing the numbers there. And so the operating cost of those rigs is coming down. And one in the Gulf of Mexico, we're actually going to stack.

Good morning, and welcome to the call. In the fourth quarter, we had normalized earnings of $0.89 per share, excluding the impact of a $3.53 per share noncash impairment charge across all of our older rigs, which Stephen will discuss in",535,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, and welcome to the call. 
In the fourth quarter, we had normalized earnings of $0.89 per share, excluding the impact of a $3.53 per share noncash impairment charge across all of our older rigs, which Stephen will discuss in detail later in the call. 
Our normalized earnings are generally in line with consensus estimates, but in order to provide a better indication of our operational performance, I would draw your attention to our adjusted EBITDA number of $246 million, which was ahead of Street estimates. 
We had a strong quarter, as our entry into the ultra-deepwater market began to pay off. This strategic move has brought significant earnings growth and greater balance to Rowan. 3 of our 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are now on rate, with a third ship going on rate 3 weeks earlier than we anticipated. Our last ship, the Rowan Relentless, is scheduled to leave Korea as planned at the end of March. Our construction program is on schedule and under budget. I'd like to give credit to our project and operations team for a terrific execution of a well-planned newbuild program and startup. 
In the fourth quarter, our jack-up operational downtime was 1.1%, with our deepwater downtime was only 1.2%. I consider this performance exceptional, where credit lies squarely with our crews and support personnel. Our out-of-service time was approximately 7%, which is in line with our previous guidance. 
Our operating costs were at the low end of our previous guidance due to a diligent effort on cost control. Needless to say, we will continue to focus on driving down costs for all of 2015. Mark will talk more about markets around the world in a few moments. However, I want to make a few general comments. We continue to see our customers reacting to the environment, scaling back their 2015 drilling plan and consequently reducing their spending. Our customers' outlooks and perspectives on the market differ, but most of them are cutting costs aggressively. Although this is a difficult environment, we have good relationships with our customers and solid contractual terms. Please rest assured that in negotiations with our customers, we will only adjust contract terms, if, as a whole, there is benefit to our shareholders through extended term or other favorable provisions. 
Rowan's financial position is sound. We have only  one payment remaining in our $3 billion construction program, and we have been successful in maintaining our investment-grade credit rating through that program. In 2015 and early 2016, we do not expect any large capital projects, only our normal rig maintenance CapEx, which Stephen will discuss later. 
We continue to review optimal capital allocation and ways to drive shareholder value. At this point in the cycle, we believe it's most prudent to preserve liquidity and maintain our strong balance sheet. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome Stephen to Rowan. We're absolutely delighted to be working with you. 
Now I'll give -- now I'll turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Stephen will give you details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and updated guidance for 2015. Thank you for your continued investment and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

We received commitments for 18 of our 19 jack-ups, which we're rolling off contract by year-end. And we finalized the contract on our fourth and final newbuild drillship. In total, we added approximately $1.9 billion worth of drilling commitments during 2014. 
There's a reason that we've been in business for over 90 years. We plan, we compete, we execute and we succeed. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time for the industry. However, our current backlog positions us favorably amongst our peers to advance through 2015 towards a cycle recovery. 
Today, I'll discuss with you current trends in the jack-up and deepwater markets, including regional comments about our areas of operations. 
Worldwide jack-up utilization is currently at 79%, down from 85% in our last call and down from 88% this time last year. The decline in commodity prices was unfortunately most severe during operators' budget season, and therefore, we've all witnessed downward pressure on day rates, length of term and in the overall number of sanction projects worldwide. However, there are positives for Rowan: Our experienced and confident workforce; our relatively young, highly capable fleet; our total backlog of $5.1 billion; and our solid long-standing relationship with customers around the world. These relationships have been developed over many years through mutual trust, operational excellence and safety and represent the very core of our success. The challenges are most definite for the coming year, but so is our steadfast resolve, as it has been in numerous business cycles this company has successfully navigated. 
Our ongoing negotiations with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea and the possibility of expanding our presence in West Africa are bright lights in a dim forecast for the industry. 
I'd now like to comment on our regional jack-up operations, starting with the North Sea. All 6 of our high-spec units are operating. Three jack-ups will roll off contract in 2015, and we are currently in discussions with several operators regarding additional work. Currently, we don't anticipate any gaps between contracts for our North Sea rigs. Our only scheduled downtime is 30 days of planned repairs and required inspections for the Rowan Stavanger in the second or third quarter of 2015. 
While we're hopeful to maintain high utilization in the North Sea, we expect some erosion in the commercial terms compared to our current contracts. 
In the Mediterranean, the Ralph Coffman continues operations with BG in Tunisia. We anticipate completion of the work in early July, with additional opportunities in the region. 
Now turning to the Middle East. My comments will be brief, as we are currently in negotiations with Saudi Aramco to extend the contracts on our 116-Cs in the region. We have been given every indication that Saudi Aramco intends to keep our jack-ups in their fleet. It is currently just a question of rate and term. Additionally, we are participating in Saudi Aramco's latest round of tenders requesting 3 jack-ups in the region. 
We are proud to mention this morning that 2015 marks the 10-year anniversary of our relationship with Saudi Aramco, and it is a top priority for us to strengthen this successful partnership for many years to come. 
In the Americas, we are pleased with our operations in Trinidad and are encouraged by the planning of additional projects in the region. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Joe Douglas was contracted to BHP, Trinidad for approximately 4 months of work and an effective rate of 231,000 per day, with operations commencing in the third quarter this year. 
We value our relationships in the region with BP, BHB, Repsol and EOG and look forward to additional opportunities to work together in the coming years. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, utilization has dropped to 25%. Only 14 jack-ups are contracted, and projects are few and far between. We haven't seen these levels since the summer of 2009. 34 jack-ups are cold stacked, with attrition expected to increase throughout the year. While we are doing our best to maneuver this well below market and meet the needs of our established customers in the region, we are actively marketing these rigs internationally. 
And finally, Southeast Asia. 2 of our 4 jack-ups are currently operating. We have multiple tenders submitted to various operators. However, there continues to be a decrease in activity, an increase of new capacity in the region, making for a very competitive environment. 
As with our rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, jack-ups in this region are being actively marketed internationally into areas where more secure long-term work is available. 
I'll conclude with a few comments on the ultra-deepwater market. As Tom mentioned, we were thrilled with the commencement of our third drillship on February 1, approximately 3 weeks earlier than expected, demonstrating our leveraging of lessons learned on our previous startups. Our fourth drillship is scheduled for delivery in late March and should commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July for Freeport-McMoRan. 
As a reminder, all 4 of our units are contracted into 2017 or beyond. Despite the challenges that the ultra-deepwater market is currently facing, our bill-stacked, high-specification drillships are the world's most advanced and capable rigs and are well positioned when the market recovers. 
From our research, we estimate that only 28 units are currently bill-stack equipped, with another 11 under construction. That's roughly 17% of the total ultra-deepwater fleet, and all 4 of Rowan's drillships have this superior capability. 
As such, we are confident in our ability to contract our ultra-deepwater units for follow-up projects when the time comes. 
I want to stress to you again that while we are certainly aware of the concerns of the industry, we are prepared, ready to compete and plan to successfully navigate the challenges of 2015. 
We appreciate your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,282964741,772837,"Rowan Companies plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2015",2015-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter 2014 operating results in comparison to third quarter results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance",1594,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter 2014 operating results in comparison to third quarter results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $327 million or $2.63 per share, including a noncash pretax impairment charge of $565 million on our 12 oldest jack-up rigs versus net income of $120 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter of 2014, which included a $41 million benefit related to U.S. tax settlement. 
The fourth quarter impairment charge and the third quarter tax benefit mask the substantial growth and profitability achieved by the company in the quarter. Excluding the impact of both these items, results improved substantially. We generated normalized net income of $111 million or $0.89 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $79 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $534 million or 17% higher than third quarter revenues due to the addition of our second ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Resolute, in October and the full quarter impact of drilling contracts for the Gorilla VI and Viking, following shipyard days, which concluded during the third quarter. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 7% of our available rig days during the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service days for both jack-ups and drillships during the quarter, which we consider an excellent result. 
Looking at 2015. As you can see in our fleet status report dated February 19, we have approximately 62% of our 2015 available days contracted. All of our drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, and approximately 57% of our available jack-up days are contracted into 2015 -- in 2015. 
Yet we also have 3 idle jack-up rigs today and an additional 13 jack-ups that have contract periods ending at various times during the year. Although we're optimistic that many of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, it is likely that some of these will experience prolonged periods of idle time. 
We've already taken steps to reduce operating costs, including our recent decision to cold-stack the Rowan Louisiana. We will continue to evaluate and potentially implement additional cost-reduction measures, as appropriate, as we progress through the year. 
Also shown in our recent fleet status report, our third ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Reliance, began operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on February 1, 3 weeks ahead of schedule. Our fourth newbuild drillship, the Rowan Relentless, is expected to be delivered at the end of the first quarter and is forecasted to commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July of this year. 
We continue to expect our operational downtime for the drillship to be less than 5% after an initial break-in period of 6 to 12 months, which operational downtime is likely to be somewhat higher. 
All in all, we do have exposure to the current relatively weak market conditions on a number of our jack-ups during 2015. Our $5.1 billion backlog of commitments, which is near an all-time high, bolsters our outlook and provides a good amount of visibility in an otherwise relatively uncertain environment. We estimate that 34% of our contract backlog will be realized over the remainder of 2015; 33% will be realized in 2016; 21% in 2017, with the balance in 2018 and beyond. 
Moving on to expenses. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $257 million, up 9% from $236 million in the third quarter, primarily due to our second ultra-deepwater drillship commencing operation and the Gorilla VI and Viking returning to service following shipyard days. 
Operating costs were also at the low end of our previous guidance, primarily due to ongoing cost control efforts. 
Looking forward for 2015. We estimate our operating expenses, excluding rebuilds, will range from $1.1 billion to $1.12 billion, an increase of 17% to 19% from the 2014 level due to the growth in drillship operating days and increased activity in Norway. 
On a net basis, the operating expenses for all our remaining rigs and shore bases are expected to decline in 2015 compared to 2014 levels. 
Our current operating cost estimate, while up from 2014 due to the growth in our business, is $30 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance due largely to the impact of our cost-reduction measures. 
First quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $275 million to $280 million. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expense totaled $34 million, which is similar to the third quarter but lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to liability-based awards and ongoing cost control efforts. 
We estimate that our 2015 SG&A expense will range from $120 million to $130 million, which represents a reduction of 4% to 12% from our previous guidance. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $31 million to $33 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled $93 million, which is higher than the third quarter level, primarily due to the addition of our second ultra-deepwater drillship in October. 
During the fourth quarter, as a result of deteriorating market conditions, we identified indicators that caused us to evaluate the book value of our assets. As a result of this impairment analysis, we determined that carrying values of our 12 oldest jack-up rigs, which were all originally constructed in the mid-1980s or earlier, were not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge in the fourth quarter, which will have the effect of reducing depreciation expense in future periods. However, as a result of this impairment analysis and other factors, we've also reduced our salvage values on all of our rigs, which will have the effect of increasing depreciation expense in future periods. 
We estimate that our 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, which, despite these changes, is largely -- is in line with our previous guidance, as the impact of our impairment charge will largely be offset by the increase attributable to lower salvage values. 
We estimate depreciation expense will range from $90 million to $92 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $30 million during the fourth quarter, which was higher than the third quarter due to lower levels of capitalized interest, following the startup of our second drillship in October. This was slightly higher than our previous guidance due to delays in newbuild capital spending, driving capitalized interest down. 
Looking forward, we expect to fund a portion of the remaining capital expenditures related to our fourth newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship with our revolving credit facility. The fourth drillship is expected to be delivered at the end of the first quarter 2015. Including the impact of this revolver draw, which we currently intend to repay with operating cash flow by the end of 2015, we estimate 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $140 million to $145 million, including $31 million to $33 million in the first quarter, which is in line with previous guidance. 
As a reminder, our interest expense will increase after our drillships are placed into service and as we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate, excluding the impact of the net tax benefits related to our asset impairment charge, was 10%, which was slightly above previous guidance due to minor changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and various discrete items. We expect our 2015 effective tax rate will range from 5% to 15%, which is a slightly wider range than our recent guidance, as a result of the greater uncertainty around our uncontracted jack-up days. 
Property and equipment additions totaled $582 million in the fourth quarter, which was nearly $100 million lower than our planned level, primarily due to the timing of certain equipment deliveries and also as a result of, but less so, cost control efforts. 
Capital expenditures related to our newbuild drillships, including mobilization, commissioning, riser gas handling, software certifications and fleet spares, totaled $518 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining capital expenditures during the fourth quarter primarily related to major rig upgrades, specifically the Gorilla VI and Vikings. 
We currently estimate our 2015 capital expenditures will range from $850 million to $875 million, with $660 million to $685 million for the final 2 newbuild drillships and related costs, which include the rig mobilizations and associated costs prior to going on rate. This is up from our previous guidance due entirely to the cost deferral from 2014. 
The remaining estimated $190 million of capital expenditures for 2015 include amounts for fleet maintenance and worldwide spares and is down 25% to 40% from our previous guidance. 
As Mark and Tom both mentioned, our industry is facing tough headwinds, but as a result of the company's solid execution of its strategic plan over the last several years, our relative position is enviable. Our operational performance is strong and improving. Our contract backlog is attractive, and our credit profile is solid. 
During this challenging period for our industry, we will continue to focus on operational execution, our excellent customer relationships, maintenance of good liquidity and a conservative balance sheet as well as opportunistic growth opportunities. 
With that, we're now prepared to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

Bussell has been stood down or warm-stacked for a bit longer, so its cost is significantly reduced. And in Southeast Asia, where 2 of those rigs are, we tend to have Rowan employees in the senior levels and contract crews in the more junior levels. Obviously, the senior level, given that they're flying a long way around the world, where most of the costs -- a chunk of the cost is. But what we have done on the 2 rigs in Southeast Asia is we have scaled back or we've released the local contract labor, and we are reducing the senior labor that flies to those rigs down to minimum safe manning levels. So we're reducing the numbers there. And so the operating cost of those rigs is coming down. And the one in the Gulf of Mexico, we actually got it hot-stacked. So we are ready to go, we're looking for contracts and working on contracts for it. I would say though that we've taken a number of people off that rig to help with our deepwater ramp-up. So it's operating at a lower cost than it would normally."

Good morning, and welcome to the call. 
In the fourth quarter, we had normalized earnings of $0.89 per share, excluding the impact of a $3.53 per share noncash impairment charge across all of our older rigs, which Stephen will discuss in detail later in the call. 
Our normalized earnings are generally in line with consensus estimates, but in order to provide a better indication of our operational performance, I would draw your attention to our adjusted EBITDA number of $246 million, which was ahead of Street estimates. 
We had a strong quarter, as our entry into the ultra-deepwater market began to pay off. This strategic move has brought significant earnings growth and greater balance to Rowan. 3 of our 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are now on rate, with a third ship going on rate 3 weeks earlier than we anticipated. Our last ship, the Rowan Relentless, is scheduled to leave Korea as planned at the end of March. Our construction program is on schedule and under budget. I'd like to give credit to our project and operations team for a terrific execution of a well planned newbuild program and startup. 
In the fourth quarter, our jack-up operational downtime was 1.1%, with our deepwater downtime was only 1.2%. I consider this performance exceptional, the credit lies squarely with our crews and support personnel. Our out-of-service time was approximately 7%, which is in line with our previous guidance. 
Our operating costs were at the low end of our previous guidance due to a diligent effort on cost control. Needless to say, we will continue to focus on driving down costs for all of 2015. Mark will talk more about markets around the world in a few moments. However, I want to make a few general comments. We continue to see our customers reacting to the environment, scaling back their 2015 drilling plan and consequently reducing their spending. Our customers' outlooks and perspectives on the market differ, but most of them are cutting costs aggressively. Although this is a difficult environment, we have good relationships with our customers and solid contractual terms. Please rest assured that in negotiations with our customers, we will only adjust contract terms, if, as a whole, there is benefit to our shareholders through extended term or other favorable provisions. 
Rowan's financial position is sound. We have only  one payment remaining in our $3 billion construction program, and we have been successful in maintaining our investment-grade credit rating through that program. In 2015 and early 2016, we do not expect any large capital projects, only our normal rig maintenance CapEx, which Stephen will discuss later. 
We continue to review optimal capital allocation and ways to drive shareholder value. At this point in the cycle, we believe it's most prudent to preserve liquidity and maintain our strong balance sheet. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome Stephen to Rowan. We're absolutely delighted to be working with you. 
Now I'll give -- now I'll turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Stephen will give you details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and updated guidance on 2015. Thank you for your continued investment and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

Despite the decline in market conditions in the fourth quarter, 2014 was a strong year for Rowan's contracting efforts. We received commitments for 18 of our 19 jack-ups, which we're rolling off contract by year-end. And we finalized the contract on our fourth and final newbuild drillship. In total, we added approximately $1.9 billion worth of drilling commitments during 2014. 
There's a reason that we've been in business for over 90 years. We plan, we compete, we execute and we succeed. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time for the industry. However, our current backlog positions us favorably amongst our peers to advance through 2015 towards a cycle recovery. 
Today, I'll discuss with you current trends in the jack-up and deepwater markets, including regional comments about our areas of operations. 
Worldwide jack-up utilization is currently at 79%, down from 85% at our last call and down from 88% this time last year. The decline in commodity prices was unfortunately most severe during operators' budget season, and therefore, we've all witnessed downward pressure on day rates, length of term and in the overall number of sanctioned projects worldwide. However, there are positives for Rowan: Our experienced and competent workforce; our relatively young, highly capable fleet; our total backlog of $5.1 billion; and our solid long-standing relationship with customers around the world. These relationships have been developed over many years through mutual trust, operational excellence and safety and represent the very core of our success. The challenges are most definite for the coming year, but so is our steadfast resolve, as it has been in numerous business cycles this company has successfully navigated. 
Our ongoing negotiations with customers in the Middle East and the North Sea and the possibility of expanding our presence in West Africa are bright lights in a dim forecast for the industry. 
I'd now like to comment on our regional jack-up operations, starting with the North Sea. All 6 of our high-spec units are operating. Three jack-ups will roll off contract in 2015, and we are currently in discussions with several operators regarding additional work. Currently, we don't anticipate any gaps between contracts for our North Sea rigs. Our only scheduled downtime is 30 days of planned repairs and required inspections for the Rowan Stavanger in the second or third quarter of 2015. 
While we're hopeful to maintain high utilization in the North Sea, we expect some erosion in the commercial terms compared to our current contracts. 
In the Mediterranean, the Ralph Coffman continues operations with BG in Tunisia. We anticipate completion of the work in early July, with additional opportunities in the region. 
Now turning to the Middle East. My comments will be brief, as we are currently in negotiations with Saudi Aramco to extend the contracts on our 116-Cs in the region. We have been given every indication that Saudi Aramco intends to keep our jack-ups in their fleet. It is currently just a question of rate and term. Additionally, we are participating in Saudi Aramco's latest round of tenders requesting 3 jack-ups in the region. 
We are proud to mention this morning that 2015 marks the 10-year anniversary of our relationship with Saudi Aramco, and it is a top priority for us to strengthen this successful partnership for many years to come. 
In the Americas, we are pleased with our operations in Trinidad and are encouraged by the planning of additional projects in the region. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Joe Douglas was contracted to BHP, Trinidad for approximately 4 months of work at an effective rate of $231,000 per day, with operations commencing in the third quarter this year. 
We value our relationships in the region with BP, BHB, Repsol and EOG and look forward to additional opportunities to work together in the coming years. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, utilization has dropped to 25%. Only 14 jack-ups are contracted, and projects are few and far between. We haven't seen these levels since the summer of 2009. 34 jack-ups are cold stacked, with attrition expected to increase throughout the year. While we are doing our best to maneuver this well-to-well market and meet the needs of our established customers in the region, we are actively marketing these rigs internationally. 
And finally, Southeast Asia. 2 of our 4 jack-ups are currently operating. We have multiple tenders submitted to various operators. However, there continues to be a decrease in activity, an increase of new capacity in the region, making for a very competitive environment. 
As with our rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, jack-ups in this region are being actively marketed internationally into areas where more secure long-term work is available. 
I'll conclude with a few comments on the ultra-deepwater market. As Tom mentioned, we were thrilled with the commencement of our third drillship on February 1, approximately 3 weeks earlier than expected, demonstrating our leveraging of lessons learned on our previous startups. Our fourth drillship is scheduled for delivery in late March and should commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July for Freeport-McMoRan. 
As a reminder, all 4 of our units are contracted into 2017 or beyond. Despite the challenges that the ultra-deepwater market is currently facing, our dual-stack high-specification drillships are the world's most advanced and capable rigs and are well positioned when the market recovers. 
From our research, we estimate that only 28 units are currently dual-stack equipped, with another 11 under construction. That's roughly 17% of the total ultra-deepwater fleet, and all 4 of Rowan's drillships have this superior capability. 
As such, we are confident in our ability to contract our ultra-deepwater units for follow-up projects when the time comes.

300794,282964741,773084,"Rowan Companies plc, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2015",2015-02-27,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter 2014 operating results in comparison to third quarter results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance",1595,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter 2014 operating results in comparison to third quarter results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $327 million or $2.63 per share, including a noncash pretax impairment charge of $565 million on our 12 oldest jack-up rigs versus net income of $120 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter of 2014, which included a $41 million benefit related to a U.S. tax settlement. 
The fourth quarter impairment charge and the third quarter tax benefit mask the substantial growth and profitability achieved by the company in the quarter. Excluding the impact from both these items, results improved substantially. We generated normalized net income of $111 million or $0.89 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $79 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $534 million or 17% higher than third quarter revenues due to the addition of our second ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Resolute, in October and the full quarter impact of drilling contracts for the Gorilla VI and Viking, following shipyard stays, which concluded during the third quarter. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 7% of our available rig days during the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service days for both jack-ups and drillships during the quarter, which we consider an excellent result. 
Looking at 2015. As you can see in our fleet status report dated February 19, we have approximately 62% of our 2015 available days contracted. All of our drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, and approximately 57% of our available jack-up days are contracted into 2015 -- in 2015. 
Yet we also have 3 idle jack-up rigs today and an additional 13 jack-ups that have contract periods ending at various times during the year. Although we're optimistic that many of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, it is likely that some of these will experience prolonged periods of idle time. 
We've already taken steps to reduce operating costs, including our recent decision to cold-stack the Rowan Louisiana. We will continue to evaluate and potentially implement additional cost-reduction measures, as appropriate, as we progress through the year. 
Also shown in our recent fleet status report, our third ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Reliance, began operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on February 1, 3 weeks ahead of schedule. Our fourth newbuild drillship, the Rowan Relentless, is expected to be delivered at the end of the first quarter and is forecasted to commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July of this year. 
We continue to expect our operational downtime for the drillships to be less than 5% after an initial break-in period of 6 to 12 months, which operational downtime is likely to be somewhat higher. 
All in all, we do have exposure to the current relatively weak market conditions on a number of our jack-ups during 2015. Our $5.1 billion backlog of commitments, which is near an all-time high, bolsters our outlook and provides a good amount of visibility in an otherwise relatively uncertain environment. We estimate that 34% of our contract backlog will be realized over the remainder of 2015; 33% will be realized in 2016; 21% in 2017, with the balance in 2018 and beyond. 
Moving on to expenses. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $257 million, up 9% from $236 million in the third quarter, primarily due to our second ultra-deepwater drillship commencing operation and the Gorilla VI and Viking returning to service following shipyard stays. 
Operating costs were also at the low end of our previous guidance, primarily due to ongoing cost control efforts. 
Looking forward for 2015. We estimate our operating expenses, excluding rebuilds, will range from $1.1 billion to $1.12 billion, an increase of 17% to 19% from the 2014 level due to the growth in drillship operating days and increased activity in Norway. 
On a net basis, the operating expenses for all our remaining rigs and shore bases are expected to decline in 2015 compared to 2014 levels. 
Our current operating cost estimate, while up from 2014 due to the growth in our business, is $30 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance due largely to the impact of our cost-reduction measures. 
First quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $275 million to $280 million. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expense totaled $34 million, which is similar to the third quarter but lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to liability-based awards and ongoing cost control efforts. 
We estimate that our 2015 SG&A expense will range from $120 million to $130 million, which represents a reduction of 4% to 12% from our previous guidance. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $31 million to $33 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled $93 million, which is higher than the third quarter level, primarily due to the addition of our second ultra-deepwater drillship in October. 
During the fourth quarter, as a result of deteriorating market conditions, we identified indicators that caused us to evaluate the book value of our assets. As a result of this impairment analysis, we determined that carrying values of our 12 oldest jack-up rigs, which were all originally constructed in the mid-1980s or earlier, were not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge in the fourth quarter, which will have the effect of reducing depreciation expense in future periods. However, as a result of this impairment analysis and other factors, we've also reduced our salvage values on all of our rigs, which will have the effect of increasing depreciation expense in future periods. 
We estimate that our 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, which, despite these changes, is largely -- is in line with our previous guidance, as the impact of our impairment charge will largely be offset by the increase attributable to lower salvage values. 
We estimate depreciation expense will range from $90 million to $92 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $30 million during the fourth quarter, which was higher than the third quarter due to lower levels of capitalized interest, following the startup of our second drillship in October. This was slightly higher than our previous guidance due to delays in newbuild capital spending, driving capitalized interest down. 
Looking forward, we expect to fund a portion of the remaining capital expenditures related to our fourth newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship with our revolving credit facility. The fourth drillship is expected to be delivered at the end of the first quarter 2015. Including the impact of this revolver draw, which we currently intend to repay with operating cash flow by the end of 2015, we estimate 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $140 million to $145 million, including $31 million to $33 million in the first quarter, which is in line with previous guidance. 
As a reminder, our interest expense will increase after our drillships are placed into service and as we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate, excluding the impact of the net tax benefits related to our asset impairment charge, was 10%, which was slightly above previous guidance due to minor changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and various discrete items. We expect our 2015 effective tax rate will range from 5% to 15%, which is a slightly wider range than our recent guidance, as a result of the greater uncertainty around our uncontracted jack-up days. 
Property and equipment additions totaled $582 million in the fourth quarter, which was nearly $100 million lower than our planned level, primarily due to the timing of certain equipment deliveries and also as a result of, but less so, cost control efforts. 
Capital expenditures related to our newbuild drillships, including mobilization, commissioning, riser gas handling, software certifications and fleet spares, totaled $518 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining capital expenditures during the fourth quarter primarily related to major rig upgrades, specifically the Gorilla VI and Viking. 
We currently estimate our 2015 capital expenditures will range from $850 million to $875 million, with $660 million to $685 million for the final 2 newbuild drillships and related costs, which include the rig mobilizations and associated costs prior to going on rate. This is up from our previous guidance due entirely to the cost deferral from 2014. 
The remaining estimated $190 million of capital expenditures for 2015 include amounts for fleet maintenance and worldwide spares and is down 25% to 40% from our previous guidance. 
As Mark and Tom both mentioned, our industry is facing tough headwinds, but as a result of the company's solid execution of its strategic plan over the last several years, our relative position is enviable. Our operational performance is strong and improving. Our contract backlog is attractive, and our credit profile is solid. 
During this challenging period for our industry, we will continue to focus on operational execution, our excellent customer relationships, maintenance of good liquidity and a conservative balance sheet as well as opportunistic growth opportunities. 
With that, we're now prepared to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

The first quarter was our strongest quarter in recent years, with earnings of $0.99 per share. This outstanding performance was due to our 3 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on the rigs during the end of the quarter, low out-of-service time and significant cost control efforts. 
I'm very pleased with our deepwater start-ups. We now have 3 of the most desirable high specification drillship in the world, operating at attractive rates with a long-term contract with 3 professional well-run operators. Our remaining newbuild drillship, the Rowan Relentless, is underway to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is expected to begin for Freeport-McMoran on a 2-year contract in July.
I am proud of our onshore and offshore employees that work tirelessly to deliver our state-of-the-art ships, finding and hiring talented experienced crewmembers and prepare the company for the ultra-deepwater market.
While all of our drillships are contracted into or beyond 2017, when we consider eventually recontracting them, we know we will be marketing assets that even our peer drilling companies consider the best of the best.
At this time, we do not have any new assets under construction and Stephen will guide you on our reduced CapEx. Our strong performance was also due to lower out-of-service time of approximately 3% [ph] in the quarter, which is on the low end of our previous guidance. This was helped in part by our operations and project teams working diligently to conduct the Gorilla II special survey while the rig was on rate in the remote parts of Indonesia.
Our idle time in the first quarter was approximately 5% compared to 3% last quarter. We made the decision to cold-stack the Rowan Louisiana during the third quarter, which joined our 2 other cold-stacked slot rigs at our [indiscernible] Texas yard. Our holding cost for these 3 rigs are minimal, but I expect to review their future this quarter. 
Today, we have 4 jack-ups either warm or hot-stacked, 2 are in Southeast Asia where we are holding our warm-stacking cost low, and 2 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which were essentially hot-stacked.
Our strong performance in the first quarter was also due to lower R&M and favorable labor variances resulting from our significant cost control efforts. As you know, our increased focus on cost control has been constant for the last 2 years. We've taken steps to reduce our headcount to necessary levels, compliment with expected activity during this downtime.
We have also reduced or eliminated certain pay programs, further driving down our labor costs. As Stephen will discuss in his comments, our R&M expenses were lower partly due to the certain activities now being planned in future quarters and partly due to a strong only spending what we need to spend. 
Although we are focused on cost control, our employees understand that we will not take any steps that might jeopardize the safety of our crews or operational integrity or our assets.
In the first quarter, we had our strongest safety performance for several years. I'd like to congratulate our crews on this excellent performance. Our jack-up operational downtime was a 1.5%, which is extremely strong. And our deepwater downtime was 5.5%, driven significantly by startup issues and the rise of problems we had on the Rowan Reliance. With respect to the Reliance issue, we had 7 days of zero rates in the first quarter and are in discussions with our customers to resolve this matter. We may have days in the second quarter at 0 rates or rather reduced operating rate, but we cannot give you a firm number at this time, although we don't expect any loss revenue to have immaterial adverse effect -- impact on our financial condition. We will not be providing any information on this subject -- any additional information on this subject on the call today. 
Mark will talk more about the markets around the world in a few moments, but as I've mentioned last quarter, we continue to see our customers reacting to the challenging market environment by scaling back 2015 drilling plans and generally reducing spending. However, we do believe our customers have been effective in cost control measures, which is a positive as it will likely make some additional drilling projects economic.
We have 15 jack-ups rolling over this year or already idle, 15 [ph] contracts in a highly competitive market with too much capacity. In addition to this tough competitive environment [indiscernible], existing customers are seeking to just contracts to reduce rates or terms. As I mentioned last quarter, we will only adjust contract terms if, as a whole, there is benefit to our shareholders through extended term, additional future work or other favorable provisions. 
Finally, I'd like to comment on the strength of our current financial position. We remain investment grade with a stable outlook, which provides financial flexibility even during these difficult times. Our strong balance sheet was the key support for our recent amendment to our revolving credit facility to extend for an additional year and to upsize to $1.5 billion from $1 billion. Stephen will provide more details, but I'd like to thank him for moving through the amendment process quickly due to his solid banking relationships to bring more lenders to our facility. 
Fundamentally, there are a number of financing strategies open to us, but we selected the one that provides the most financial flexibility at the lowest cost. I'm also pleased that due to our cost control efforts, we are able to significantly draw less on our revolver than previously expected to make our final drillship payment. We expect the allocation of capital and particularly return on capital we continue to review optimal strategy and way to drive shareholder value. However, we're not yet confident that we know how long -- how deep this collapse in rig demand and overcapacity will be. And until we have more clarity on the severity and duration of the market downturn, we believe it is prudent to keep our powder dry to provide sufficient liquidity to weather this storm and to maintain our strong balance sheet.
We have been asked about whether we would buy distressed assets. We've continually reviewed potential assets to acquire, however, until drilling demand recovers the assets [indiscernible] declined significantly, we do not foresee purchasing in the future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update in the market and the Stephen will give you details of our first quarter financial results and updated guidance for 2015. Thank you for your continued investment and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

My remarks will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the challenging market conditions, but I will discuss our views of the current trends and regional comments about our areas of operations. 
In the jack-up market, the first quarter was notably quiet regarding new contract fixtures. News headlines focused instead on contract cancellations and renegotiations. 
Worldwide jack-up utilization is currently 77%, down from 79% at our last call and down from 87% this time last year. Despite the challenges, we are cautiously optimistic regarding the recent stabilization in commodity prices and the possibility of increased contracting opportunities in the coming months. Make no mistake, it will be a battle for whatever demand exists in the near future. But Rowan is well positioned to fight with a long-standing history of operational excellence, a geographically diversified and highly-capable fleet and solid relationships with our valued customers worldwide. 
One of those important customers is Saudi Aramco. As reported in our fleet status, we reduced day rates for a 12-month period on 5 of our jack-ups. We believe this was a necessary decision for the long-term strength of our relationship with Saudi Aramco. 
Regarding our 116 [ph] season region, several contract in dates have recently been extended. the Arch Rowan is extended to June 15; and the Middletown and the Charles Rowan to June 30. As a reminder, the Gilbert Row is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco about future opportunities, so we'll not comment further.
In the North Sea, negotiations on contract extensions are also ongoing for the Gorilla V and the Gorilla VII with their current operators, Total and Apache. While we expect a decrease in commercial terms from the current contracts, we are hopeful to maintain high utilization. 
The Rowan Stavanger was recently awarded a 30-day extension for accommodations work at a $150,000 per day, which will carry the rig into June 2015. We are in conversations with several operators about future projects for the jack-up following its scheduled 30-day off rate time for maintenance and inspection. 
Both the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are struggling as well toward jack-up markets. We currently have 4 rigs idle in this regions facing various challenges. Parking season approaches, but the U.S. Gulf as well as minimal operator budgets. Southeast Asia is burdenEd with the influx of newbuilds and significant capital budget cuts from NOCs in the region. Fortunately, we were able to contract the XL 3 with ExxonMobil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $75,000 a day, or approximately 35 to 45 days. But these short-term projects will not sustain our expectations for our [indiscernible] rigs. We are actively marketing our available jack-ups in the areas of the world that may provide longer-term contracts. There are opportunities for our capable fleet on a term basis and we are aggressively pursuing them.
We continue to attract the supply changes in the jack-up market through additions and attrition. We believe that cold-stacked jack-ups will struggle to enter the market and are rarely capable to compete with current vendor requirements. However, the jack-up sectors seems to lag behind the floaters in deciding to scrap the units altogether.
Looking at the newbuild jack-ups, while there are a significant number of uncontracted units, many of them are being built by companies that do not currently operate jack-ups. Additionally, more than 20% of the jack-up newbuild fleet has had delivery delays of 6 months or more. We are mindful of these situations and their potential impact, but our focus is on contracting our jack-up fleets using the foundation of more than 90 [ph] year history. The experience and confidence of our crews and high specification fleet, that positions us well to advance for our cycle recovery.
Turning now to a few comments in our ultra-deepwater fleets. As Tom mentioned, our fourth newbuild ship, the Rowan Relentless, is in route to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence operations for Freeport-McMoRan in July. This commencement will culminate the strategic vision set forth in 2009 when Rowan decided to forge into the ultra-deepwater market. Our intention was to build state-of-the-art equipment meeting the anticipated needs of our customers in a constantly evolving market. As we watched the acceleration of retirements of various generation of semis and drillships, we realized even more the importance of the commitment to building the right assets at the right time.
All 4 of our drillships have firm multiyear terms supported by what we believe to be solid contracts. As a reminder, our units are contracted into 2017 or beyond. We are proud to be associated with our customer base who are all leaders in the ultra-deepwater arena. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of market improvements. We appreciate your time of day. And I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

This morning I would like to walk you through our first quarter 2015 operating results, in comparison to fourth quarter 2014 results. I will also provide you with an update to our comps and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
For the first quarter, we reported net income of $124 million or $0.99 per share, versus in the fourth quarter 2014 a net loss of $327 million or $2.63 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $565 million on our 12 oldest jack-up rigs. 
Even when excluding the impact of the impairment charge, our results improved, as we generated normalized net income of $111 million or $0.89 per share in the fourth quarter 2014.
First quarter revenues were $537 million, excluding rebillable items, and relatively flat with fourth quarter 2014 revenues, as incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships offset a modest reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet.
Together, our third drillship, the Rowan Reliance, which began operating in February; and our second drillship, the Rowan Resolute, which began operating in the fourth quarter of 2014, contributed an additional 86 operating days. Inversely, our jack-up fleet had 195 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for certain rigs, including the Louisiana which we cold-stacked during the quarter, the EXL I, EXL III and the J.P. Bussell.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the first quarter, which is at the low end of our previous guidance, as planned off rate inspection periods for certain rigs were delayed to future periods and to a lesser extent, reduced or eliminated.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted, but is available to work, was approximately 5% of our available days. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 2% of in-service days for both jack-ups and in total.
Drillship downtime during the quarter was approximately 6%. 
All in all, our marketed utilization rate was relatively flat at 90% versus 92% in the fourth quarter. 
As we look to the near and intermediate term, we are in relatively good position, with approximately 60% of our remaining 2015 available days already contracted, including all of our available drillship days in the 2017 or beyond.
Our $4.7 billion backlog continues to provide attractive visibility over the next few [ph] years. And together with our experienced crews, fleet quality and geographic diversity, remains one of our key strengths.
Our relative position in the industry is strong, but we also have a 4 idle jack-up rigs today and an additional 11 jack-ups that have contract periods ending at various times during 2015. Although we believe some of this rigs will remain contracted without interruption, a number of units are likely to experience prolonged periods of idle time. And as a result, our utilization rates is likely to decline further over the next few quarters.
Nonetheless, as a result of this successful execution of our entry into the deepwater market, by the third quarter 2015 our operating results should benefit from the full quarter contribution of all 4 newbuild drillships, as the Rowan Relentless Rich, which was delivered on March 31, is expected to commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses were $245 million excluding rebuilds, down 5% from $257 million in the fourth quarter, despite approximately $13 million in additional costs related to our incremental drillship available days. These costs were more than offset by our cost control efforts and reduced levels of repair and maintenance, some of which have now been scheduled for future periods.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $1,015,000,000 [ph] to $1,030,000,000 [ph], which is approximately $90 [ph] million or 8% lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to the impact of our various cost-reduction measures and reduced activity levels. Of the $90 million reduction, approximately 75% was driven by cost reduction measures, with the balance primarily stemming from reduced activity. 
Second quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $260 million to $265 million, up from first quarter levels on higher repair and maintenance expense and the full quarter impact of operations for the Rowan Reliance. Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $28 million, which is lower than the fourth quarter 2014 level and lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to liability based awards and ongoing cost control efforts.
We estimate that our full year 2015 SG&A expense will range from $115 million to $120 million, which represents a reduction of 4% to 8% from our previous guidance and from 2014 levels, again largely due to ongoing cost-reduction efforts. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $32 million in the second quarter 2015, up over the first quarter level primarily due to a normalized level of equity compensation expense.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $90 [ph] million, slightly lower than the fourth quarter 2014 level, but in line with our guidance. We continue to estimate that full year 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, including approximately $95 million in the second quarter. 
Interest expense net of capitalized interest was $33 million during the first quarter, which was higher than the prior quarter due to lower levels of capitalized interest following the startup of the Rowan Reliance in February. This was at the high end of our previous guidance as the vessel commenced operations several weeks earlier than estimated.
On March 31, we made the final installment payment for and took delivery of our fourth drillship, the Rowan Relentless. In early April, we borrowed $50 million under our revolving credit facility. This draw was much lower than our earlier estimate as a result of both the reduction in drilling expenses and capital expenditures as well as deferrals of both until later in the year. 
Including the impact of this revolver draw, which we currently intend to repay with operating cash flows by the end of the third quarter, we estimate 2015 interest expense net of capitalized interest will approximate $145 million to $150 million, including $30 million in the second quarter. This is slightly above our previous guidance, as lower capitalized interest is partially offset by reduced interest from our lower borrowings. As a reminder, our interest expense will increase after our drillships are placed into service and we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate is 12%, which is in line with guidance. We expect our full year 2015 tax rate will range from 10% to 15%, which is at the upper end of previous guidance due to additional income and higher tax jurisdiction and reduced interest expense reductions in the U.S.
Property and equipment additions totaled $540 [ph] million in the first quarter, which was nearly $200 million lower than our planned level, primarily due to the timing of certain equipment deliveries and continued effort to reduce our capital spending. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild drillships totaled $478 million in the first quarter. The remaining $36 million of capital expenditures during the first quarter primarily related to maintenance CapEx. 
We currently estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $775 million to $800 million, with $595 million to $620 million for the final 2 newbuild drillships, and related cost which include the rig mobilization commissioning, fleet spares and associated costs prior to commencing operations.
These amounts are approximately 8% to 10% lower than our previous guidance primarily due to the successful execution of our drillship projects and CapEx reduction efforts. The remaining estimated $180 [ph] million is primarily for maintenance capital expenditures and fleet spares.
While 2015 looks to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm extremely pleased with how the company has responded to the deteriorating environment and with the positive impact of our cost control efforts. Since our third quarter 2014 conference call in early November, we have reduced our costs and capital spending guidance for 2015 substantially. Guidance for drilling expense has declined by 11%, or $120 million. SG&A guidance has declined by 13%, or $17 million. And capital expenditures guidance has declined by 10%, or $90 [ph] million. Excluding CapEx related to the newbuild, this represents a reduction of approximately 35%. We believe these are extremely meaningful reductions, particularly in light of our relatively modest decline in activity levels. 
Should activity decline further than we anticipate, we will respond and rightsize our cost structure to the degree prudent. 
I am also pleased to report today that we have increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion previously. We have also extended the maturity by 1-year to January 2020. 
Borrowing capacity for the final year of the agreement declines by $60 million to $1.44 billion. We believe this considerable increase in our liquidity enhances our flexibility during this downturn. 
I am grateful for the strong support of our lenders during this challenging environment and thank them for their continued commitment to the company in recognition of our strong position within the industry. 
With that, we're now prepared to open the call to questions. Operator?"

The first quarter was our strongest quarter in recent years, with earnings of $0.99 per share. This outstanding performance was due to our 3 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate the end of the quarter, low out-of-service time and significant cost control efforts. 
I'm very pleased with our deepwater start-ups. We now have 3 of the most desirable high specification drillships in the world, operating at attractive rates with a long-term contract with 3 professional well-run operators. Our remaining newbuild drillship, the Rowan Relentless, is underway to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is expected to begin working for Freeport-McMoRan on a 2-year contract in July.
I am proud of our onshore and offshore employees that work tirelessly to deliver our state-of-the-art ships, find and hired talented and experienced crew members and prepare the company for operations in the ultra-deepwater market.
While all of our drillships are contracted into or beyond 2017, when we consider eventually recontracting them, we know we will be marketing assets that even our peer drilling companies consider the best of the best.
At this time, we do not have any new assets under construction, and Stephen will guide you on our reduced CapEx. Our strong performance was also due to lower out-of-service time of approximately 3% in the quarter, which is on the low end of our previous guidance. This was helped in part by our operations and project teams working diligently to conduct the Gorilla II special survey while the rig was on rate in the remote parts of Indonesia.
Our idle time in the first quarter was approximately 5% compared to 3% last quarter. We made the decision to cold-stack the Rowan Louisiana during the third quarter, which joined our 2 other cold-stacked slot rigs at our Sabine Pass, Texas yard. Our holding costs on these 3 rigs are minimal, but I expect to review their future this quarter. 
Today, we have 4 jack-ups, either warm or hot-stacked, 2 in Southeast Asia where we are holding our warm-stacking cost low, and 2 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which were essentially hot-stacked.
Our strong performance in the first quarter was also due to lower R&M and favorable labor variances resulting from our significant cost control efforts. As you know, our increased focus on cost control has been constant for the last 2 years. We've taken steps to reduce our headcount to necessary levels, compliment with expected activity during this downtime.
We have also reduced or eliminated certain pay programs, further driving down our labor costs. As Stephen will discuss in his comments, our R&M expenses were lower partly due to certain activities now being planned in future quarters and partly due to a strong focus on only spending what we need to spend. 
Although we are focused on cost control, our employees understand that we will not take any steps that might jeopardize the safety of our crews or operational integrity or our assets.
In the first quarter, we had our strongest safety performance for several years. I'd like to congratulate our crews on this excellent performance. Our jack-up operational downtime was 1.5%, which is extremely strong. And our deepwater downtime was 5.5%, driven significantly by startup issues and the rise of problems we had on the Rowan Reliance. With respect to the Reliance issue, we had 7 days of 0 rates in the first quarter and are in discussions with our customers to resolve this matter. We may have days in the second quarter at 0 rates or rather reduced operating rate, but we cannot give you a firm number at this time, although we don't expect any loss revenue to have a material adverse effect -- impact on our financial condition. We will not be providing any information on this subject, any additional information on this subject on the call today. 
Mark will talk more about the markets around the world in a few moments, As I've mentioned last quarter, we continue to see our customers reacting to the challenging market environment by scaling back 2015 drilling plans and generally reducing spending. However, we do believe our customers have been effective in cost control measures, which is a positive as it will likely make some additional drilling projects economic.
We have 15 jack-ups rolling over this year, all already idle, seeking contracts in a highly competitive market with too much capacity. In addition to this tough competitive environment [indiscernible], existing customers are seeking to adjust contracts to reduce rates or terms. As I mentioned last quarter, we will only adjust contract terms if, as a whole, there is benefit to our shareholders through extended term, additional future work or other favorable provisions. 
Finally, I'd like to comment on the strength of our current financial position. We remain investment grade with a stable outlook, which provides financial flexibility even during these difficult times. Our strong balance sheet was the key support for our recent amendment to our revolving credit facility to extend for an additional year and to upsize to $1.5 billion from $1 billion. Stephen will provide more details, but I'd like to thank him for moving through the amendment process quickly utilizing his solid banking relationships to bring more lenders into our facility. 
Fundamentally, there are a number of financing strategies open to us, but we selected the one that provides the most financial flexibility at the lowest cost. I'm also pleased that due to our cost control efforts, we are able to significantly draw less on our revolver than previously expected to make our final drillship payment. We expect the allocation of capital and particularly return on capital, we continue to review optimal strategy and way to drive shareholder value. However, we're not yet confident that we know how long and how deep this collapse in rig demand and overcapacity will be. Until we have more clarity on the severity and duration of the market downturn, we believe that it's prudent to keep our powder dry to provide sufficient liquidity to weather this storm and to maintain our strong balance sheet.
We have been asked about whether we would buy distressed assets. We continually review potential assets to acquire, however, until drilling demand recovers the assets [indiscernible] declined significantly, we do not foresee a purchase in the near future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and the Stephen will give you details of our first quarter financial results and updated guidance for 2015. Thank you for your continued investment and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

My remarks will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the challenging market conditions, but I will discuss our views of the current trends and regional comments about our areas of operations. 
In the jack-up market, the first quarter was notably quiet regarding new contract fixtures. News headlines focused instead on contract cancellations and renegotiations. 
Worldwide jack-up utilization is currently 77%, down from 79% at our last call and down from 87% this time last year. Despite the challenges, we are cautiously optimistic regarding the recent stabilization in commodity prices and the possibility of increased contracting opportunities in the coming months. Make no mistake, it will be a battle for whatever demand exists in the near future. But Rowan is well positioned to fight with a long-standing history of operational excellence, a geographically diversified and highly capable fleet and solid relationships with our valued customers worldwide. 
One of those important customers is Saudi Aramco. As reported in our fleet status, we reduced day rates for a 12-month period on 5 of our jack-ups. We believe this was a necessary decision for the long-term strength of our relationship with Saudi Aramco. 
Regarding our 116 seasonal region, several contract end dates have recently been extended. The Arch Rowan is extended to June 15 and the Middletown and the Charles Rowan to June 30. As a reminder, the Gilbert Row is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco about future opportunities, so we'll not comment further.
In the North Sea, negotiations on contract extensions are also ongoing for the Gorilla V and the Gorilla VII with their current operators, Total and Apache. While we expect a decrease in commercial terms from the current contracts, we are hopeful to maintain high utilization. 
The Rowan Stavanger was recently awarded a 30-day extension for accommodations work at a $150,000 per day, which will carry the rig into June 2015. We are in conversations with several operators about future projects for the jack-up following its scheduled 30-day off rate time for maintenance and inspections. 
Both the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are struggling as well to well jack-up markets. We currently have 4 rigs idle in these regions facing various challenges. Parking season approaches for the U.S. Gulf as well as minimal operator budgets. Southeast Asia is burdened with the influx of newbuilds and significant capital budget cuts from NOCs in the region. Fortunately, we were able to contract the XL 3 with ExxonMobil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $75,000 a day, or approximately 35 to 45 days. But these short-term projects will not sustain our expectations for our high-spec rigs. We are actively marketing our available jack-ups in the areas of the world that may provide longer-term contracts. There are opportunities for our capable fleet on a term basis and we are aggressively pursuing them.
We continue to track the supply changes in the jack-up market through additions and attrition. We believe that cold-stacked jack-ups will struggle to reenter the market and are rarely capable to compete in current tender requirements. However, the jack-up sector seems to lag behind the floaters in deciding to scrap the units altogether.
Looking at the newbuild jack-ups, while there are a significant number of uncontracted units, many of them are being built by companies that do not currently operate jack-ups. Additionally, more than 20% of the jack-up newbuild fleet has had delivery delays of 6 months or more. We are mindful of these situations and their potential impact, but our focus is on contracting our jack-up fleet using the foundation of more than 90-year history. The experience and confidence of our crews and our high-specification fleet, that positions us well to advance for cycle recovery.
Turning now to a few comments on our ultra-deepwater fleets. As Tom mentioned, our fourth newbuild drill ship, the Rowan Relentless, is in route to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence operations for Freeport-McMoRan in July. This commencement will culminate the strategic vision set forth in 2009 when Rowan decided to forge into the ultra-deepwater market. Our intention was to build state-of-the-art equipment meeting the anticipated needs of our customers in a constantly evolving market. As we watched the accelerated retirements of various generation of semis and drillships, we realized even more the importance of the commitment to building the right assets at the right time.
All 4 of our drillships have firm multiyear terms supported by what we believe to be solid contracts. As a reminder, our units are contracted into 2017 or beyond. We are proud to be associated with our customer base who are all leaders in the ultra-deepwater arena. Overall, we believe we're well positioned to take advantage of market improvement. We appreciate your time of day. And I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

This morning I would like to walk you through our first quarter 2015 operating results, in comparison to fourth quarter 2014 results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
For the first quarter, we reported net income of $124 million or $0.99 per share, versus in the fourth quarter 2014, a net loss of $327 million or $2.63 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $565 million on our 12 oldest jack-up rigs. 
Even when excluding the impact of the impairment charge, our results improved, as we generated normalized net income of $111 million or $0.89 per share in the fourth quarter 2014 
First quarter revenues were $537 million, excluding rebillable items, and relatively flat with fourth quarter 2014 revenues, as incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships offset a modest reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet.
Together, our third drillship, the Rowan Reliance, which began operating in February; and our second drillship, the Rowan Resolute, which began operating in the fourth quarter of 2014, contributed an additional 86 operating days. Inversely, our jack-up fleet had 195 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for certain rigs, including the Louisiana which we cold-stacked during the quarter, the EXL I, EXL III and the J.P. Bussell.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the first quarter, which is at the low end of our previous guidance, as planned off rate inspection periods for certain rigs were delayed to future periods and to a lesser extent, reduced or eliminated.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, was approximately 5% of our available days. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 2% of in-service days for both jack-ups and in total.
Drillship downtime during the quarter was approximately 6%. 
All in all, our marketed utilization rate was relatively flat at 90% versus 92% in the fourth quarter. 
As we look to the near and intermediate term, we are in relatively good position, with approximately 60% of our remaining 2015 available days already contracted, including all of our available drillship days in the 2017 or beyond.
Our $4.7 billion backlog continues to provide attractive visibility over the next few years. And together with our experienced crews, fleet quality and geographic diversity, remains one of our key strengths.
Our relative position in the industry is strong, but we also have 4 idle jack-up rigs today and an additional 11 jack-ups that have contract periods ending at various times during 2015. Although we believe some of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, a number of units are likely to experience prolonged periods of idle time. And as a result, our utilization rates likely to decline further over the next few quarters.
Nonetheless, as a result of this successful execution of our entry into the deepwater market, by the third quarter 2015, our operating results should benefit from the full quarter contribution of all 4 newbuild drillships, as the Rowan Relentless, which was delivered on March 31, is expected to commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses were $245 million excluding rebills, down 5% from $257 million in the fourth quarter, despite approximately $13 million in additional costs related to our incremental drillship available days. These costs were more than offset by our cost control efforts and reduced levels of repair and maintenance, some of which have now been scheduled for future periods.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $1,015,000,000 to $1,030,000,000, which is approximately $90 million or 8% lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to the impact of our various cost-reduction measures and reduced activity levels. Of the $90 million reduction, approximately 75% was driven by cost reduction measures, with the balance primarily stemming from reduced activity. 
Second quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $260 million to $265 million, up from first quarter levels on higher repair and maintenance expense and the full quarter impact of operations for the Rowan Reliance. Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $28 million, which is lower than the fourth quarter 2014 level and lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to liability based awards and ongoing cost control efforts.
We estimate that our full year 2015 SG&A expense will range from $115 million to $120 million, which represents a reduction of 4% to 8% from our previous guidance and from 2014 levels, again, largely due to ongoing cost-reduction efforts. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $32 million in the second quarter 2015, up over the first quarter level primarily due to a normalized level of equity compensation expense.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $90 million, slightly lower than the fourth quarter 2014 level, but in line with our guidance. We continue to estimate that full year 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, including approximately $95 million in the second quarter. 
Interest expense net of capitalized interest was $33 million during the first quarter, which was higher than the prior quarter due to lower levels of capitalized interest following the startup of the Rowan Reliance in February. This was at the high end of our previous guidance as the vessel commenced operations several weeks earlier than estimated.
On March 31, we made the final installment payment for and took delivery of our fourth drillship, the Rowan Relentless. In early April, we borrowed $50 million under our revolving credit facility. This draw was much lower than our earlier estimate as a result of both the reduction in drilling expenses and capital expenditures as well as deferrals of both until later in the year. 
Including the impact of this revolver draw, which we currently intend to repay with operating cash flows by the end of the third quarter, we estimate 2015 interest expense net of capitalized interest will approximate $145 million to $150 million, including $30 million in the second quarter. This is slightly above our previous guidance, as lower capitalized interest is partially offset by reduced interest from our lower borrowings. As a reminder, our interest expense will increase after our drillships are placed into service and we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was 12%, which is in line with guidance. We expect our full year 2015 tax rate will range from 10% to 15%, which is at the upper end of previous guidance due to additional income and higher tax jurisdiction and reduced interest expense deductions in the U.S.
Property and equipment additions totaled $514 million in the first quarter, which was nearly $200 million lower than our planned level, primarily due to the timing of certain equipment deliveries and continued effort to reduce our capital spending. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild drillships totaled $478 million in the first quarter. The remaining $36 million of capital expenditures during the first quarter primarily related to maintenance CapEx. 
We currently estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $775 million to $800 million, with $595 million to $620 million for the final 2 newbuild drillships and related costs which include the rig mobilization commissioning, fleet spares and associated costs prior to commencing operations.
These amounts are approximately 8% to 10% lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the successful execution of our drillship projects and CapEx reduction efforts. The remaining estimated $180 million is primarily for maintenance capital expenditures and fleet spares.
While 2015 looks to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm extremely pleased with how the company has responded to the deteriorating environment and with the positive impact of our cost control efforts. Since our third quarter 2014 conference call in early November, we have reduced our costs and capital spending guidance for 2015 substantially. Guidance for drilling expense has declined by 11%, or $120 million. SG&A guidance has declined by 13%, or $17 million. And capital expenditures guidance has declined by 10%, or $90 million. Excluding CapEx related to the newbuild, this represents a reduction of approximately 35%. We believe these are extremely meaningful reductions, particularly in light of our relatively modest decline in activity levels. 
Should activity decline further than we anticipate, we will respond and rightsize our cost structure to the degree prudent. 
I am also pleased to report today that we have increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion previously. We have also extended the maturity by 1-year to January 2020. 
Borrowing capacity for the final year of the agreement declines by $60 million to $1.44 billion. We believe this considerable increase in our liquidity enhances our flexibility during this downturn. 
I am grateful for the strong support of our lenders during this challenging environment and thank them for their continued commitment to the company in recognition of our strong position within the industry.

We're not cold-stacking those rigs by any means, but we've got 2 rigs that actually sat right next to each other and we're managing the crews on them to have a low number of people. And using the crews that would be on those rigs, we've let go of the national crews, the national junior crews that were the contracts, and so it's really the senior Rowan employees in those rigs, Americans that we are - would be on those rigs but we'll be utilizing those crews to backfill other parts of the company. So our stacking cost on those rigs is pretty low. Regarding what we would do, as far as rigs come off contract, it's hard to say because it will depends what the opportunities are. If we think the opportunities are like in the Gulf, they're a bit better, then we would push up, either you keep it more hot-stacked. And if the opportunities are definitely less obvious or direct as they are in Southeast Asia, we would basically pull the rig cost down. So it would be hard to say.

The first quarter was our strongest quarter in recent years, with earnings of $0.99 per share. This outstanding performance was due to our 3 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate the end of the quarter, low out-of-service time and significant cost control efforts. 
I'm very pleased with our deepwater start-ups. We now have 3 of the most desirable high specification drillships in the world, operating at attractive rates with long-term contracts with 3 professional well-run operators. Our remaining newbuild drillship, the Rowan Relentless, is under way to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is expected to begin working for Freeport-McMoRan on a 2-year contract in July.
I am proud of our onshore and offshore employees that work tirelessly to deliver our state-of-the-art ships, find and hire talented and experienced crew members and prepare the company for operations in the ultra-deepwater market.
While all of our drillships are contracted into or beyond 2017, when we consider eventually recontracting them, we know we will be marketing assets that even our peer drilling companies consider the best of the best.
At this time, we do not have any new assets under construction, and Stephen will guide you on our reduced CapEx. Our strong performance was also due to lower out-of-service time of approximately 3% in the quarter, which is on the low end of our previous guidance. This was helped in part by our operations and project teams working diligently to conduct the Gorilla II special survey while the rig was on rate in the remote parts of Indonesia.
Our idle time in the first quarter was approximately 5% compared to 3% last quarter. We made the decision to cold-stack the Rowan Louisiana during the quarter, which joined our 2 other cold-stacked slot rigs at our Sabine Pass, Texas yard. Our holding costs on these 3 rigs are minimal, but I expect to review their future this quarter. 
Today, we have 4 jack-ups, either warm or hot-stacked, 2 in Southeast Asia where we are holding our warm-stacking costs low, and 2 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which were essentially hot-stacked.
Our strong performance in the first quarter was also due to lower R&M and favorable labor variances resulting from our significant cost control efforts. As you know, our increased focus on cost control has been constant for the last 2 years. We've taken steps to reduce our headcount to necessary levels, compliment with expected activity during this downtime.
We have also reduced or eliminated certain pay programs, further driving down our labor costs. As Stephen will discuss in his comments, our R&M expenses were lower partly due to certain activities now being planned in future quarters and partly due to a strong focus on only spending what we need to spend. 
Although we are focused on cost control, our employees understand that we will not take any steps that might jeopardize the safety of our crews or operational integrity of our assets.
In the first quarter, we had our strongest safety performance for several years. I'd like to congratulate our crews on this excellent performance. Our jack-up operational downtime was 1.5%, which is extremely strong. And our deepwater downtime was 5.5%, driven significantly by startup issues and the rise of problems we had on the Rowan Reliance. With respect to the Reliance issue, we had 7 days of 0 rates in the first quarter and are in discussions with our customers to resolve this matter. We may have days in the second quarter at 0 rates or at a reduced operating rate, but we cannot give you a firm number at this time, although we don't expect any lost revenue to have a material adverse effect -- impact on our financial condition. We will not be providing any information on this subject -- any additional information on this subject on the call today. 
Mark will talk more about the markets around the world in a few moments. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to see our customers reacting to the challenging market environment by scaling back 2015 drilling plans and generally reducing spending. However, we do believe our customers have been effective in cost control measures, which is a positive as it will likely make some additional drilling projects economical.
We have 15 jack-ups rolling over this year or already idle, seeking contracts in a highly competitive market with too much capacity. In addition to this tough competitive environment for new awards, existing customers are seeking to adjust contracts to reduce rates or terms. As I mentioned last quarter, we will only adjust contract terms if, as a whole, there is benefit to our shareholders through extended term, additional future work or other favorable provisions. 
Finally, I'd like to comment on the strength of our current financial position. We remain investment grade with a stable outlook, which provides financial flexibility even during these difficult times. Our strong balance sheet was the key support for our recent amendment to our revolving credit facility to extend for an additional year and to upsize to $1.5 billion from $1 billion. Stephen will provide more details, but I'd like to thank him for moving through the amendment process quickly utilizing his solid banking relationships to bring more lenders into our facility. 
Fundamentally, there are a number of financing strategies open to us, but we selected the one that provides the most financial flexibility at the lowest cost. I'm also pleased that due to our cost control efforts, we were able to significantly draw less on our revolver than previously expected to make our final drillship payments. With respect to allocation of capital and particularly return on capital, we've continued to review optimal strategies and way to drive shareholder value. However, we're not yet confident that we know how long and how deep this collapse in rig demand and overcapacity will be. Until we have more clarity on the severity and duration of the market downturn, we believe that it's prudent to keep our powder dry to provide sufficient liquidity to weather this storm and to maintain our strong balance sheet.
We have been asked about whether we would buy distressed assets. We continually review potential assets to acquire, however, until drilling demand recovers or assets' prices decline significantly, we do not foresee a purchase in the near future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Stephen will give you details of our first quarter financial results and updated guidance for 2015. Thank you for your continued investment and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

My remarks will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the challenging market conditions, but I will discuss our views of the current trends and regional comments about our areas of operations. 
In the jack-up market, the first quarter was notably quiet regarding new contract fixtures. News headlines focused instead on contract cancellations and renegotiations. 
Worldwide jack-up utilization is currently 77%, down from 79% at our last call and down from 87% this time last year. Despite the challenges, we are cautiously optimistic regarding the recent stabilization in commodity prices and the possibility of increased contracting opportunities in the coming months. Make no mistake, it will be a battle for whatever demand exists in the near future. But Rowan is well positioned to fight with a long-standing history of operational excellence, a geographically diversified and highly capable fleet and solid relationships with valued customers worldwide. 
One of those important customers is Saudi Aramco. As reported in our fleet status, we reduced day rates for a 12-month period on 5 of our jack-ups. We believe this was a necessary decision for the long-term strength of our relationship with Saudi Aramco. 
Regarding our 116-Cs in the region, several contract end dates have recently been extended. The Arch Rowan is extended to June 15 and the Middletown and the Charles Rowan to June 30. As a reminder, the Gilbert Row is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco about future opportunities, so we'll not comment further.
In the North Sea, negotiations on contract extensions are also ongoing for the Gorilla V and the Gorilla VII with their current operators, Total and Apache. While we expect a decrease in commercial terms from the current contracts, we are hopeful to maintain high utilization. 
The Rowan Stavanger was recently awarded a 30-day extension for accommodations work at a $150,000 per day, which will carry the rig into June 2015. We are in conversations with several operators about future projects for the jack-up following its scheduled 30-day off rate time for maintenance and inspections. 
Both the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are struggling as well-to-well jack-up markets. We currently have 4 rigs idle in these regions facing various challenges. Hurricane season approaches for the U.S. Gulf as well as minimal operator budgets. Southeast Asia is burdened with the influx of newbuilds and significant capital budget cuts from NOCs in the region. Fortunately, we were able to contract the XL 3 with ExxonMobil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $75,000 a day, for approximately 35 to 45 days. But these short-term projects will not sustain our expectations for our high-spec rigs. We are actively marketing our available jack-ups in the areas of the world that may provide longer-term contracts. There are opportunities for our capable fleet on a term basis and we are aggressively pursuing them.
We continue to track the supply changes in the jack-up market through additions and attrition. We believe that cold-stacked jack-ups will struggle to reenter the market and are rarely capable to compete in current tender requirements. However, the jack-up sector seems to lag behind the floaters in deciding to scrap the units altogether.
Looking at the newbuild jack-ups, while there are a significant number of uncontracted units, many of them are being built by companies that do not currently operate jack-ups. Additionally, more than 20% of the jack-up newbuild fleet has had delivery delays of 6 months or more. We are mindful of these situations and their potential impact, but our focus is on contracting our jack-up fleet using the foundation of more than 90-year history. The experience and competence of our crews and our high-specification fleet, that positions us well to advance toward cycle recovery.
Turning now to a few comments on our ultra-deepwater fleet. As Tom mentioned, our fourth newbuild drill ship, the Rowan Relentless, is en route to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence operations for Freeport-McMoRan in July. This commencement will culminate the strategic vision set forth in 2009 when Rowan decided to forge into the ultra-deepwater market. Our intention was to build state-of-the-art equipment meeting the anticipated needs of our customers in a constantly evolving market. As we watch the accelerated retirements of various generations of semis and drillships, we realized even more the importance of the commitment to building the right assets at the right time.
All 4 of our drillships have firm multiyear terms supported by what we believe to be solid contracts. As a reminder, our units are contracted into 2017 or beyond. We are proud to be associated with our customer base, who are all leaders in the ultra-deepwater arena. Overall, we believe we're well positioned to take advantage of market improvement. We appreciate your time today. And I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

For the first quarter, we reported net income of $124 million or $0.99 per share versus, in the fourth quarter 2014, a net loss of $327 million or $2.63 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $565 million on our 12 oldest jack-up rigs. 
Even when excluding the impact of the impairment charge, our results improved, as we generated normalized net income of $111 million or $0.89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
First quarter revenues were $537 million, excluding rebillable items, and relatively flat with fourth quarter 2014 revenues, as incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships offset a modest reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet.
Together, our third drillship, the Rowan Reliance, which began operating in February; and our second drillship, the Rowan Resolute, which began operating in the fourth quarter of 2014, contributed an additional 86 operating days. Conversely, our jack-up fleet had 195 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for certain rigs, including the Louisiana, which we cold-stacked during the quarter, the EXL I, EXL III and the J.P. Bussell.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the first quarter, which is at the low end of our previous guidance, as planned off rate inspection periods for certain rigs were delayed to future periods and, to a lesser extent, reduced or eliminated.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, was approximately 5% of our available days. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 2% of in-service days for both jack-ups and in total.
Drillship downtime during the quarter was approximately 6%. 
All in all, our marketed utilization rate was relatively flat at 90% versus 92% in the fourth quarter. 
As we look to the near and intermediate term, we are in relatively good position, with approximately 60% of our remaining 2015 available days already contracted, including all of our available drillship days into 2017 or beyond.
Our $4.7 billion backlog continues to provide attractive visibility over the next few years. And together with our experienced crews, fleet quality and geographic diversity, remains one of our key strengths.
Our relative position in the industry is strong, but we also have 4 idle jack-up rigs today and an additional 11 jack-ups that have contract periods ending at various times during 2015. Although we believe some of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, a number of units are likely to experience prolonged periods of idle time. And as a result, our utilization rate's likely to decline further over the next few quarters.
Nonetheless, as a result of this successful execution of our entry into the deepwater market, by the third quarter 2015, our operating results should benefit from the full quarter contribution of all 4 newbuild drillships, as the Rowan Relentless, which was delivered on March 31, is expected to commence operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in July.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses were $245 million excluding rebills, down 5% from $257 million in the fourth quarter, despite approximately $13 million in additional costs related to our incremental drillship available days. These costs were more than offset by our cost control efforts and reduced levels of repair and maintenance, some of which have now been scheduled for future periods.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $1,015,000,000 to $1,030,000,000, which is approximately $90 million or 8% lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to the impact of our various cost-reduction measures and reduced activity levels. Of the $90 million reduction, approximately 75% was driven by cost reduction measures, with the balance primarily stemming from reduced activity. 
Second quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $260 million to $265 million, up from first quarter levels on higher repair and maintenance expense and the full quarter impact of operations for the Rowan Reliance. Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $28 million, which is lower than the fourth quarter 2014 level and lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to liability based awards and ongoing cost control efforts.
We estimate that our full year 2015 SG&A expense will range from $115 million to $120 million, which represents a reduction of 4% to 8% from our previous guidance and from 2014 levels, again, largely due to ongoing cost-reduction efforts. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $32 million in the second quarter 2015, up over the first quarter level primarily due to a normalized level of equity compensation expense.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $90 million, slightly lower than the fourth quarter 2014 level, but in line with our guidance. We continue to estimate that full year 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, including approximately $95 million in the second quarter. 
Interest expense net of capitalized interest was $33 million during the first quarter, which was higher than the prior quarter due to lower levels of capitalized interest following the startup of the Rowan Reliance in February. This was at the high end of our previous guidance as the vessel commenced operations several weeks earlier than estimated.
On March 31, we made the final installment payment for and took delivery of our fourth drillship, the Rowan Relentless. In early April, we borrowed $50 million under our revolving credit facility. This draw was much lower than our earlier estimate as a result of both a reduction in drilling expenses and capital expenditures as well as deferrals of both until later in the year. 
Including the impact of this revolver draw, which we currently intend to repay with operating cash flows by the end of the third quarter, we estimate 2015 interest expense net of capitalized interest will approximate $145 million to $150 million, including $30 million in the second quarter. This is slightly above our previous guidance, as lower capitalized interest is partially offset by reduced interest from our lower borrowings. As a reminder, our interest expense will increase after our drillships are placed into service and we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was 12%, which is in line with guidance. We expect our full year 2015 tax rate will range from 10% to 15%, which is at the upper end of previous guidance due to additional income and higher tax jurisdictions and reduced interest expense deductions in the U.S.
Property and equipment additions totaled $514 million in the first quarter, which was nearly $200 million lower than our planned level, primarily due to the timing of certain equipment deliveries and continued efforts to reduce our capital spending. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild drillships totaled $478 million in the first quarter. The remaining $36 million of capital expenditures during the first quarter primarily related to maintenance CapEx. 
We currently estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $775 million to $800 million, with $595 million to $620 million for the final 2 newbuild drillships and related costs which include the rig mobilization, commissioning, fleet spares and associated costs prior to commencing operations.
These amounts are approximately 8% to 10% lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the successful execution of our drillship projects and CapEx reduction efforts. The remaining estimated $180 million is primarily for maintenance capital expenditures and fleet spares.
While 2015 looks to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm extremely pleased with how the company has responded to the deteriorating environment and with the positive impact of our cost control efforts. Since our third quarter 2014 conference call in early November, we have reduced our costs and capital spending guidance for 2015 substantially. Guidance for drilling expense has declined by 11%, or $120 million. SG&A guidance has declined by 13%, or $17 million. And capital expenditures guidance has declined by 10%, or $90 million. Excluding CapEx related to the newbuild, this represents a reduction of approximately 35%. We believe these are extremely meaningful reductions, particularly in light of our relatively modest decline in activity levels. 
Should activity decline further than we anticipate, we will respond and rightsize our cost structure to the degree prudent. 
I am also pleased to report today that we have increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion previously. We have also extended the maturity by 1 year to January 2020. 
Borrowing capacity for the final year of the agreement declines by $60 million to $1.44 billion. We believe this considerable increase in our liquidity enhances our flexibility during this downturn. 
I am grateful for the strong support of our lenders during this challenging environment and thank them for their continued commitment to the company in recognition of our strong position within the industry. 
With that, we're now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

But they're effectively hot-stacked, because we do see opportunities. And we don't want to lose our capabilities. So the EXL III, Mark announced, just went out on a job for Exxon, and which we're delighted to have. And so we are seeing opportunities. And moving into hurricane season, so some of our bigger rigs will have become -- that the market is tougher during hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico. But some of our bigger rigs become more interesting because they just have -- they're more versatile during July to November -- June to November. Southeast Asia, we have 2 rigs stacked there. We're not cold-stacking those rigs by any means, but we've got 2 rigs that actually sat right next to each other and we're managing the crews on them to have a low number of people. And using the crews that would be on those rigs, we've let go of the national crews, the national junior crews that were the contracts, and so it's really the senior Rowan employees on those rigs, Americans that we are -- would be on those rigs but we'll be utilizing those crews to backfill for other parts of the company. So our stacking cost on those rigs is pretty low. Regarding what we would do, as far as rigs come off contract, it's hard to say because it really depends what the opportunities are. If we think the opportunities are, like in the GOM, they're a bit better, then we would push up to keep it more hot-stacked. And if the opportunities are definitely less obvious or direct, like they are in Southeast Asia, we would basically pull the rig cost down. So it would be hard to say. As far as costing on those, Stephen?"

The second quarter continued our strong financial performance for 2015 with earnings of $0.68 per share. Highlights for the quarter included all of our four [ph] newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships by the end of the quarter, low out-of-service time and continued progress on cost control efforts. 
I'm proud of of Rowan highly successful entry into the ultra-deepwater arena. Through the diligent efforts of our employees, we have completed a significant newbuild program and now have four of the most viable high-specification drillships in the world to complement our high-specification jack-up fleet. This timely transformation has positioned us well to navigate the challenging market conditions in our industry. 
Our strong performance was also due to lower out-of-service client for approximately 2% in the quarter, an improvement from last quarter and below our previous guidance. This was helped in part by our operations and projects team working diligently to minimize the time spent conducting statutory surveys and planned maintenance. 
While our current backlog provides us strength and stability over the next couple of years, we are mindful that several of our jack-ups are currently idled, and several others have contract renewals before the end of the year. As a result, our idle time for the quarter rose to 12%, up from 5% in the first quarter. Over the coming quarters, we expect our overall fleet utilization to remain under pressure, but we believe our high-specification rigs and dedication to safe and reliable operation will position us well when opportunities surface.
Today, we have two warm-stacked jack-up fleet in Southeast Asia, where we continue to hold our stacking costs low and three ready stacked jack-ups, one in North America, one in the U.K. sector the North Sea and one in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As you may have seen in our recent fleet status report, Repsol elected to terminate and pay out a contract of the Gorilla III in Trinidad. 
Following its plan to demobilization back to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico later this month, this jack-up invest at risk of joining the list of assets in our fleet that are warm already stacked. 
The Rowan Louisiana remains cold-stacked in yard, and we recently closed the sale of two of our oldest jack-ups, the Rowan Juneau and the Rowan Alaska. The sale agreement provides that these rigs are prohibited from operating in drilling units. As for the overall market, the upcoming deliveries of on-contracted newbuilds jack-ups will add to the oversupply. However, we believe an even larger number of older jack-ups are primed to permanently exit the market. These retirements should pave the way for eventual improvement in the supply-demand balance. 
We continue to see the benefits of our cost-cutting initiatives in the second quarter with further reductions in operating expenses versus the first quarter, mainly driven by lower personnel-related costs. Accordingly, we have lowered our full year cost guidance. As mentioned on last quarter's call and worth repeating today, although we are focused on cost control, we continually communicate to our employees that the safety of personnel, protection of marine environment and the operational integrity of our assets always come first. 
We remain in discussions with our customers over the influence [ph] on the Rowan Reliance earlier this year, and we hope to reach resolution in this in the near future. The North [indiscernible] 3 well has passed the debt of the North 2 well when it was applied and abandoned earlier in the second quarter. 
Unfortunately, beyond the further color that Steven will provide in his prepared comments, we are not able to provide any more detailed comments on this matter until final resolution with the customer. 
Mark will provide our views about each of our markets of operation in a moment, but we continue to see our customers slow to bring additional demand to drilling services to the market, and we see risk of continued spending restraint into 2016 if commodity prices remain depressed through the budgeting season. 
However, we are starting to see signs from some of our customers that reduced service costs are beginning to make some additional drilling projects economic even without significant commodity price appreciation. 
For example, in the second quarter, you saw us make adjustments on two of our three ultra-harsh high-specification jack-ups in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, extending both contracts well into 2016 in exchange for some price relief in 2015. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. With our final drillship payment now behind us, we expect our credit ratios to continue to improve, further supporting our investment-grade credit rating. 
Finally, we are continuing reviewing our allocation and capital option. Our focus is on driving shareholder value over the long term and protecting our cash position. As the recent slide in oil prices back to near prior lows has reminded us, it's not yet clear when the offshore drilling market will improve. Accordingly, we will adjust our appetite and willingness to deploy capital when it becomes clear that doing so is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Steven will give you details of our second quarter financial results and updated full year guidance for 2015. 
Thank you for your continued investments and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

Today, I will briefly discuss the jack-up market in general before making a few regional Rowan-specific remarks for the second quarter. I'll conclude with a few comments on the ultra-deepwater market. 
In the jack-up market, the second quarter showed a bit of improvement with regard to tender activity over the first quarter 2015. However, modest incremental demand was no match for the supply of jack-ups rolling off contract. Worldwide jack-up market utilization, which excludes cold-stacked units, is currently 83%, down from 84% at our last call and down from 91% this time last year. While jack-up contractors have started to remove units from the total fleet, albeit slower than the floater market, we're a long with from a balance and supply demand. It's clear that the remainder of 2015 will be a challenge, and it seems that all eyes will be on commodity process as we enter the 2016 budget season to determine if there will be any signs of improvement in the next 18 months. 
Despite the difficult market, we remain confident in our stability as a company and our ability to manage through the cycle. 
That confidence comes from a more than 90-year [ph] history, a safe and reliable workforce and strong customer relationships. Our global diversification and solid backlog positions us well for the road to an eventual recovery. 
Despite the decrease in worldwide jack-up utilization, we were able to successfully roll three Rowan rigs under projects that extend past year-end 2015. Additionally, we added short-term contracts the six jack-ups. While commercial terms continue to decline, we are pleased with the utilization we've been able to add to our fleet, given these market conditions. 
Two of our longer-term extensions are in the North Sea. We were able to blend and extend the contracts for the Gorilla V and the Gorilla VII with their current operators, Total and Apache. The Rowan Stavanger is currently idle, but we're in discussions with several operators in the region for 2015 projects. We're confident that we can add utilization to the unit, though lower commercial terms are expected. 
I'll quickly mention the Middle East, though my comments will be brief given the sensitivity of ongoing discussions. In the second quarter, several short-term contract extensions were announced for our 116-Cs. The Arch Rowan, Charles Rowan and the Rowan Middletown are currently contracted through August 31, 2015. We are hopeful that our long-standing relationship with Saudi Aramco will lead to continued operations of these jack-ups. 
Turning to the Americas. As reported in the fleet status, the Joe Douglas will conclude operations with petroleum this month and will prepare for mobilization from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Trinidad for an estimated contract commencement in early October for BHP Billiton. The Gorilla III is currently completing operations for the Group in Trinidad and will mobilize back to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the early termination in payout of the contract. 
Though we have witnessed some project deferrals, we remain modestly optimistic about the opportunities for idle jack-up and those that will require additional work in 2015. It will be a fierce competition for whatever demand exists in the coming months, but we believe our highly capable fleet and solid relationships with the customers around the world gives us an advantage over our peer group. 
Shifting to the ultra-deepwater market. As Tom mentioned, we are proud of the completion of our ultra-deepwater newbuild program. The strategic vision set out in 2009 has been realized in all four of our dual-stacked, steady yard drillships are now operating. We are grateful to the customer share partnering and the inaugural operation of our ships and look forward to years in service would these great assets. 
Our drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, and we believe our contracts are solid. 
As it is a common question, I'll briefly address the topic of blend and extend. We are open to the idea and currently in communication with our customers about opportunities for future projects. The agreement will have to be favorable to both parties and is expected there is much discussion on what rates will look like in the 2017-2018 timeframe. 
In the meantime, we are focused on operational execution on our ships to prove that our established operational excellence in the jack-up market has transitioned into the deepwater arena. 
In closing, despite the uncertainty of the duration of this cycle, Rowan's stability and strategic management of this difficult market will safeguard us until the inevitable recovery. 
We appreciate your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Steven."

This morning, I would like to walk you through our second quarter 2015 operating results in comparison to first quarter 2015 results. I will also provide you with some updates to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the second quarter, we reported net income of $85 million or $0.68 per share, including an incremental $5 million or $0.02 per share as part of an estimated settlement related to a dispute on a prior jack-up refurbishment project versus $124 million or $0.99 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet that more than offset the incremental activities from our ultra-deepwater drillships. 
Second quarter revenues were $496 million, excluding rebillable items, and about 8% lower than the first quarter 2015 revenues. And additional 26 operating days and nearly $15 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillship, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, but those sales to offset reduced contributions from our jack-ups. Our jack-up fleet generated nearly 200 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time from various rigs, including the Joe Douglas, Gorilla IV and EXL I. 
Average jack-up day rates declined by 5% due to lower rates on certain new contract fixtures as well as full quarter impact of lower rates on certain of our rigs working for Saudi Aramco. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 2% of our available rig days during the second quarter, which was slightly favorable versus our expectations as planned operated inspection periods for certain rigs were delayed to future periods and, to a lesser extent, reduced or eliminated. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was slightly over 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 3% in total. 
Drillship downtime during the quarter of approximately 13% was adversely impacted by certain days as 0 rate assumed for an estimated period that remains under discussion with our customer for the Reliance related to the first quarter riser steel incident. We continue to believe that final resolution of the incident is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. 
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 12% of available days from 5% in the prior quarter. Two of the three rigs that drove most of the variance, the Joe Douglas and the Gorilla IV, have since returned to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the third rig, EXL I, remains warm-stacked with reduced crude levels in Southeast Asia. 
All in all, our market utilization rates was 82% in the second quarter versus 90% in the first quarter. 
Beginning with the third quarter 2015, our revenue should benefit from full quarter contribution from all our newbuild drillships, as our fourth vessel, the Relentless, commenced operations in mid-June. However, with five jack-up rigs idle today and an additional eight with availability during the remainder of 2015, we will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts. Yet we also believe that certain of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, and a number of other units will secure a meaningful new work. 
Moving on to expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses were $241 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of 2% from $245 million in the first quarter despite approximately $6 million in additional costs related to our incremental drillship available days. These costs were more than offset by our ongoing cost control efforts on both active and idle rigs. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $1 billion to $1,010,000,000, which is $15 million to $20 million lower than our previous guidance. This guidance is due largely to the impact of our cost-reduction measures, including reduced personnel-related expenses, rig insurance and other expenses. 
Third quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $265 million to $270 million, up from second quarter levels, primarily due to the full quarter impact of operations for the Relentless and higher repairs and maintenance expense, mainly due to timing of certain activity. Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues. 
Our second quarter SG&A expense totaled $31 million, which was generally in line with our previous guidance but higher than the first quarter level, as the higher value of equity compensation expense related to liability-based awards offset our successful cost control measures. 
We continue to estimate that our full year 2015 SG&A expense will range from $115 million to $120 million, which is slightly lower than 2014 levels. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $31 million in the third quarter 2015, in line with the level experienced in the second quarter. 
As I mentioned in my opening, second quarter results were adversely impacted by an estimated settlement for a dispute related to a refurbishment project on the Gorilla III during 2013 and 2014. The general contractor has claims now totaling $25 million, exclusive of interest and legal costs. The company had previously accrued for an estimated liability and recognized an incremental $5 million during the second quarter. While the final outcome of this dispute is uncertain, we do not believe this resolution will have a material impact on our financial statement. 
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $95 million, in line with guidance but slightly higher than the first quarter level as a result of the Reliance and Relentless being placed into service during 2015. We continue to expect our full year 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, including approximately $102 million in the third quarter, also higher as a result of incurring a full quarter of depreciation related to the Relentless. 
Interest expense net of capitalized interest of $31 million during the second quarter was lower than the prior quarter due to higher levels of capitalized interest on the Relentless. This was at the high end of our previous guidance, as the vessel commenced operations earlier than estimated and less interest is capitalized. We continue to expect full year 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $145 million to $150 million. 
Now that our newbuild construction program is behind us and all of our ultra-deepwater drillships are in service, third quarter interest expense is expected to rise to $41 million as we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our second quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was slightly below previous guidance. We continue to expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate to range from 10% to 15%, with the third quarter rate slightly higher than the range and the fourth quarter rate back in the low teens. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $102 million in the second quarter, with approximately half relating to newbuild drillships and the other half for maintenance capital. We currently estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $750 million to $775 million, with approximately $615 million having already been incurred during the first half and more than 85% of that amount related to our final two newbuild drillships, including their mobilization, commissioning, fleet spares and associated costs prior to commencing operation. 
Other than approximately $35 million for residual newbuild-related costs, the remaining property additions during 2015 will primarily be for maintenance capital expenditures and fleet spares. 
Our liquidity remains strong. While our cash balance was only $200 million at quarter end, we maintain near full availability under our revolver as it was only reduced by a modest $50 million borrowing, which was still outstanding at quarter end. 
During the second quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion previously and extended the maturity by 1 year to January 2020. Borrowing capacity for the final year of the agreement declined by $60 million to $1.44 billion. 
We continue to believe this considerable increase in our liquidity enhances our flexibility during this downturn. 
Given the growth in offshore rig supply over the last several years, coupled with declining oil prices over the past year and a swift budgetary response by operators, it is no surprise that 2015 continues to be a challenging year for the industry. Unfortunately, with crude prices recently taking another leg down following a rally in the spring, we are now likely to see further capital expenditure reductions by many operators in 2016, again, pressuring our industry further. 
Rowan was already well positioned relative to many of our peers prior to this challenging business climate, as we expect to be one of the few companies in the sector to post higher recurring earnings during 2015 despite the downturn. We are also one of the few players in the industry with our deepwater feet fully contracted well into 2017 and beyond, our newbuild capital commitment now behind us, manageable leverage overall and no debt maturities until late 2017. 
Nonetheless, this attractive relative position should be taken into context of a challenged market, and therefore, we have responded to rightsize our cost structure for the environment, reducing both 2015 drilling expense and general and administrative expense guidance over the past 9 months by approximately 12% or $160 million and capital expenditures by 13% or $115 million. Certain of these actions such as reducing our short-based headcount around the world by nearly 20% since January and eliminating certain composition elements have been difficult decisions, but we have done what we need to do to maintain our strong franchise and attractive relative position. We believe these are extremely meaningful reductions, particularly in light of our relatively modest decline in activity level. Given our view that we are unlikely to see a recovery in 2016, we will continue to hone our onshore cost structure, and to the extent activity levels low for prolonged periods of time, our offshore cost structure as well. However, we will not make any reductions that we expect would impact the safety of our people, the integrity of our equipment or the efficiency of our operations. 
We plan on providing 2016 cost guidance on our third quarter earnings call. 
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

So I think like I mentioned in my comments, we've got five rigs right now. Two of them, both new rigs, less than about 5, 6 years old. I mean, and they're in Singapore and we reduced the stacking cost on those significantly, and we've moved into stacking mode meaning that we changed the maintenance plans so it's more an operating procedure. But those rigs could be reactivated very quickly. So we are -- the one good thing about jack-up if you can reduce cost on rigs the removing the crude and focusing on purely preventable -- high-level preventive maintenance. So I'd say that we have stacked rigs, the two warm-stacked rigs in Southeast Asia, but we don't have full crude on them by any means. And we're not quite ready to take this up fully cold-stacked status because we've got some opportunity for them. And not talk about it, we're doing [indiscernible] a lot of market acceptance they are desirable rigs. So if we look here 1 year from now or maybe 6 months from now, we still have no opportunity for those rigs. We probably did come down that level. In the Gulf of Mexico, it's a little different because there is opportunity, although there are [indiscernible] we have our other rigs. We are -- a little bit different as we have rigs that we have opportunity. And so rig, it is somewhat difficult because we might have an opportunity, which we think is around the quarter, and then it will drag out because of permits or whatever. But the Gulf of Mexico, we have taken one rig out of the fleet, and we are always looking at it as do we have the right number of rig there? Some of the others like the North Sea, I mean, that Stavanger had just literally come off contract in the last week, and we've got some opportunity. A bigger rig like that is definitely more expensive to stack. And so -- but we definitely evaluate it, and certainly not going to be scared or shy of gold stacking rigs come if we feel that it comes there. Mark?"

I'd say, just on the cost and on the cost side, I think we were probably a bit more conservative when we were doing our planning from where our cost of -- costs have come out. I think as you probably went through our investor deck a couple of years, what we saw our OpEx would be on our newbuild drillships and probably see it dropped down over the last -- because we weren't in the ultra-deepwater market, and so all of our cost analysis was basically bottoms-up. And we -- and also we were looking at the very tight layer market at that time. So I think our costs have come in a little bit lower. It's early days yet, and clearly, we are continuing in the ultra-deepwater market for just over 1 yea with one rig, which is working maybe in Angola and Canary Islands and now back to the U.S. If that rig is just around of it, but I would say that I'm actually really pleased with how we've managed the cost and repair and maintenance expense. And the real focus in our America deepwater group are being efficient and making sure that we spend enough and not overspend. Regarding the operating efficiency economy, I mean,m actually, we've had a few Subsea incidents where we basically downtime. And we expected those, but actually it being apart from the issue on the Reliance, it's been especially been working really well. I would say that we have the benefit of being somewhat later entrant in some of our peers and another issues are being knocked out. And so I do feel that our downtime is being less than expected. I think we'd say, I think what we're saying in our fleet status about our deepwater downturn, that downtime is going to be the same just holding that, which, 6 months to 1 year, it should be within 95%. So I think it varies a bit, but I think we're still kind of on track with what we thought, although our costs are a little bit better than expected."

The second quarter continued our strong financial performance for 2015, with earnings of $0.68 per share. Highlights for the quarter included all of our 4 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships on rates by the end of the quarter, low out-of-service time and continued progress on cost control efforts. 
I'm proud of Rowan's highly successful entry into the ultra-deepwater arena. Through the diligent efforts of our employees, we have completed a significant newbuild program and now have 4 of the most viable high-specification drillships in the world to complement our high-specification jack-up fleet. This timely transformation has positioned us well to navigate the challenging market conditions in our industry. 
Our strong performance was also due to lower out-of-service time of approximately 2% in the quarter, an improvement from last quarter and below our previous guidance. This was helped in part by our operations and projects teams working diligently to minimize the operate time spent conducting statutory surveys and planned maintenance. 
While our current backlog provides us strength and stability over the next couple of years, we are mindful that several of our jack-ups are currently idled, and several others have contract renewals before the end of the year. As a result, our idle time for the quarter rose to 12%, up from 5% in the first quarter. Over the coming quarters, we expect our overall fleet utilization to remain under pressure, but we believe our high-specification rigs and dedication to safe and reliable operation will position us well when opportunities surface.
Today, we have two warm-stacked jack-ups in Southeast Asia where we continue to hold our stacking costs low and three ready-stacked jack-ups: One in North Africa; one in the U.K. sector of the North Sea; and one in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As you may have seen in our recent fleet status report, Repsol elected to terminate and pay out its contract for the Gorilla III in Trinidad. 
Following its planned demobilization back to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico later this month, this jack-up is at risk of joining the list of assets in our fleet that are warm or ready-stacked. 
The Rowan Louisiana remains cold-stacked in our Sabine yard, and we recently closed the sale of 2 of our oldest jack-ups, the Rowan Juneau and the Rowan Alaska. The sale agreement provides that these rigs are prohibited from operating a drilling unit. As for the overall market, the upcoming deliveries of uncontracted newbuild jack-ups will add to the oversupply. However, we believe an even larger number of older jack-ups are primed to permanently exit the market. These retirements should pave the way for eventual improvement in the supply-demand balance. 
We continue to see the benefits of our cost-cutting initiatives in the second quarter with further reductions in operating expenses versus the first quarter, mainly driven by lower personnel-related costs. Accordingly, we have lowered our full year cost guidance. As mentioned on last quarter's call and worth repeating today, although we are focused on cost control, we continually communicate to our employees that the safety of personnel, protection of the marine environment and the operational integrity of our assets always come first. 
We remain in discussions with our customer over the influence on the Rowan Reliance early this year, and we hope to reach resolution in this in the near future. The North Platte #3 well has passed the depths of the North Platte #2 well when it was plugged and abandoned early in the second quarter. 
Unfortunately, beyond the further color that Stephen will provide in his prepared comments, we are not able to provide any more detailed comments on this matter until final resolution with the customer. 
Mark will provide our views about each of our markets of operation in a moment, but we continue to see our customers slow to bring additional demand for drilling services to the market, and we see risk of continued spending restraint into 2016 if commodity prices remains depressed through the budgeting season. 
However, we are starting to see signs from some of our customers that reduce service costs are beginning to make some additional drilling projects economic even without significant commodity price appreciation. 
For example, in the second quarter, you saw us make adjustments on 2 of our 3 ultra-harsh high-specification jack-ups in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, extending both contracts well into 2016 in exchange for some price relief in 2015. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. With our final drillship payment now behind us, we expect our credit ratios to continue to improve, further supporting our investment-grade credit rating. 
Finally, we are continuing reviewing our allocation with capital option. Our focus is on driving shareholder value over the long term and protecting our cash position. As the recent slide in oil prices back to near prior lows has reminded us, it's not yet clear when the offshore drilling market will improve. Accordingly, we will adjust our appetite and willingness to deploy capital when it becomes clear that doing so is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Stephen will give you details of our second quarter financial results and updated full year guidance for 2015. 
Thank you for your continued investments and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

Today, I will briefly discuss the jack-up market in general before making a few regional Rowan-specific remarks for the second quarter. I'll conclude with a few comments on the ultra-deepwater market. 
In the jack-up market, the second quarter showed a bit of improvement with regard to tender activity over the first quarter 2015. However, modest incremental demand was no match for the supply of jack-ups rolling off contract. Worldwide jack-up market utilization, which excludes cold-stacked units, is currently 83%, down from 84% at our last call and down from 91% this time last year. While jack-up contractors have started to remove units from the total fleet, albeit slower than the floater market, we're a long way from a balance in supply and demand. It's clear that the remainder of 2015 will be a challenge, and it seems that all eyes will be on commodity process as we enter the 2016 budget season to determine if there will be any signs of improvement in the next 18 months. 
Despite the difficult market, we remain confident in our stability as a company and our ability to manage through the cycle. 
That confidence comes from a more than 90-year history of safe and reliable workforce and strong customer relationships. Our global diversification and solid backlog positions us well for the road to an eventual recovery. 
Despite the decrease in worldwide jack-up utilization, we were able to successfully roll 3 Rowan rigs under projects that extend past year-end 2015. Additionally, we added short-term contracts to six jack-ups. Though commercial terms continue to decline, we are pleased with the utilization we've been able to add to our fleet given these market conditions. 
Two of our longer-term extensions are in the North Sea. We were able to blend and extend the contracts for the Gorilla V and the Gorilla VII with their current operators, Total and Apache. The Rowan Stavanger is currently idle, but we're in discussions with several operators in the region for 2015 projects. We're confident that we can add utilization to the unit, though lower commercial terms are expected. 
I'll quickly mention the Middle East, though my comments will be brief given the sensitivity of ongoing discussions. In the second quarter, several short-term contract extensions were announced for our 116-Cs. The Arch Rowan, Charles Rowan and the Rowan Middletown are currently contracted through August 31, 2015. We are hopeful that our long-standing relationship with Saudi Aramco will lead to continued operations of these jack-ups. 
Turning to the Americas. As reported in the fleet status, the Joe Douglas will conclude operations with Rooster Petroleum this month and will prepare for mobilization from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Trinidad for an estimated contract commencement in early October for BHP Billiton. The Gorilla III is currently completing operations for the rig share group in Trinidad and will mobilize back to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the early termination and payout of the contract. 
Though we have witnessed some project deferrals, we remain modestly optimistic about the opportunities for idle jack-ups and those that will require additional work in 2015. It will be a fierce competition for whatever demand exists in the coming months, but we believe our highly capable fleet and solid relationships with the customers around the world gives us an advantage over our peer group. 
Shifting to the ultra-deepwater market. As Tom mentioned, we are proud of the completion of our ultra-deepwater newbuild program. The strategic vision set out in 2009 has been realized in all four of our dual-stacked, state-of-the-art drillships are now operating. We are grateful to the customers we're partnering and the inaugural operation of our ships and look forward to years of service with these great assets. 
Our drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, and we believe our contracts are solid. 
As it is a common question, I'll briefly address the topic of blend and extend. We are open to the idea and currently in communication with our customers about opportunities for future projects. The agreement will have to be favorable to both parties, and as expected, there is much discussion on what rates will look like in the 2017-2018 time frame. 
In the meantime, we are focused on operational execution on our ships to prove that our established operational excellence in the jack-up market has transitioned into the deepwater arena. 
In closing, despite the uncertainty of the duration of this cycle, Rowan's stability and strategic management of this difficult market will safeguard us until the inevitable recovery. 
We appreciate your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

This morning, I would like to walk you through our second quarter 2015 operating results in comparison to first quarter 2015 results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the second quarter, we reported net income of $85 million or $0.68 per share, including an incremental $5 million or $0.02 per share as part of an estimated settlement related to a dispute on a prior jack-up refurbishment project versus $124 million or $0.99 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet that more than offset the incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships. 
Second quarter revenues were $496 million, excluding rebillable items, and about 8% lower than the first quarter 2015 revenues. An additional 26 operating days and nearly $15 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillship, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, but those failed to offset reduced contributions from our jack-up. Our jack-up fleet generated nearly 200 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time from various rigs, including the Joe Douglas, Gorilla IV and EXL I. 
Average jack-up day rates declined by 5% due to lower rates on certain new contract fixtures as well as a full quarter impact of lower rates on certain of our rigs working for Saudi Aramco. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 2% of our available rig days during the second quarter, which was slightly favorable versus our expectations as plans to operate inspection periods for certain rigs were delayed to future periods and, to a lesser extent, reduced or eliminated. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was slightly over 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 3% in total. 
Drillship downtime during the quarter of approximately 13% was adversely impacted by certain days as 0 rate assumed for an estimated period that remains under discussion with our customer for the Reliance related to the first quarter riser steel incident. We continue to believe that final resolution of the incident is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. 
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 12% of available days from 5% in the prior quarter. Two of the three rigs that drove most of the variance, the Joe Douglas and the Gorilla IV, have since returned to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the third rig, EXL I, remains warm-stacked with reduced crude levels in Southeast Asia. 
All in all, our marketed utilization rate was 82% in the second quarter versus 90% in the first quarter. 
Beginning with the third quarter 2015, our revenue should benefit from full quarter contribution from all our newbuild drillships, as our fourth vessel, the Relentless, commenced operations in mid-June. However, with 5 jack-up rigs idle today and an additional 8 with availability during the remainder of 2015, we will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts. Yet we also believe that certain of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, and a number of other units will secure a meaningful new work. 
Moving on to expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses were $241 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of 2% from $245 million in the first quarter, despite approximately $6 million in additional costs related to our incremental drillship available days. These costs were more than offset by our ongoing cost control efforts on both active and idle rigs. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $1 billion to $1,010,000,000, which is $15 million to $20 million lower than our previous guidance. This guidance is due largely to the impact of our cost-reduction measures, including reduced personnel-related expenses, rig insurance and other expenses. 
Third quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $265 million to $270 million, up from second quarter levels, primarily due to the full quarter impact of operations for the Relentless and higher repairs and maintenance expense mainly due to timing of certain activity. Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
Our second quarter SG&A expense totaled $31 million, which was generally in line with our previous guidance, but higher than the first quarter level, as the higher value of equity compensation expense related to liability-based awards offset our successful cost control measures. 
We continue to estimate that our full year 2015 SG&A expense will range from $115 million to $120 million, which is slightly lower than 2014 levels. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $31 million in the third quarter 2015, in line with the level experienced in the second quarter. 
As I mentioned in my opening, second quarter results were adversely impacted by an estimated settlement for a dispute related to a refurbishment project on the Gorilla III during 2013 and 2014. The general contractor has asserted claims now totaling $25 million, exclusive of interest and legal costs. The company had previously accrued for an estimated liability and recognized an incremental $5 million during the second quarter. While the final outcome of this dispute is uncertain, we do not believe its resolution will have a material impact on our financial statement. 
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $95 million, in line with guidance but slightly higher than the first quarter level as a result of the Reliance and Relentless being placed into service during 2015. We continue to expect our full year 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, including approximately $102 million in the third quarter, also higher as a result of incurring a full quarter of depreciation related to the Relentless. 
Interest expense net of capitalized interest of $31 million during the second quarter was lower than the prior quarter due to higher levels of capitalized interest on the Relentless. This was at the high end of our previous guidance, as the vessel commenced operations earlier than estimated and less interest was capitalized. We continue to expect full year 2015 interest expense net of capitalized interest will approximate $145 million to $150 million. 
Now that our newbuild construction program is behind us and all of our ultra-deepwater drillships are in service, third quarter interest expense is expected to rise to $41 million as we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our second quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was slightly below previous guidance. We continue to expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate to range from 10% to 15%, with the third quarter rate slightly higher than the range and the fourth quarter rate back in the low teens. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $102 million in the second quarter, with approximately half relating to newbuild drillships and the other half for maintenance CapEx. We currently estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $750 million to $775 million, with approximately $615 million having already been incurred during the first half and more than 85% of that amount related to our final 2 newbuild drillships, including their mobilization, commissioning, fleet spares and associated costs prior to commencing operation. 
Other than approximately $35 million for residual newbuild-related costs, the remaining property additions during 2015 will primarily be for maintenance capital expenditures and fleet spares. 
Our liquidity remains strong. While our cash balance was only $200 million at quarter end, we maintain near full availability under our revolver as it was only reduced by a modest $50 million borrowing, which was still outstanding at quarter end. 
During the second quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion previously, and extended the maturity by 1 year to January 2020. Borrowing capacity for the final year of the agreement declined by $60 million to $1.44 billion. 
We continue to believe this considerable increase in our liquidity enhances our flexibility during this downturn. 
Given the growth in offshore rig supply over the last several years, coupled with declining oil prices over the past year and a swift budgetary response by operators, it is no surprise that 2015 continues to be a challenging year for the industry. Unfortunately, with crude prices recently taking another leg down following a rally in the spring, we are now likely to see further capital expenditure reductions by many operators in 2016, again, pressuring our industry further. 
Rowan was already well-positioned relative to many of our peers prior to this challenging business climate, as we expect to be one of the few companies in the sector to post higher recurring earnings during 2015 despite the downturn. We are also one of the few players in the industry with our deepwater fleet fully contracted well into 2017 and beyond, our newbuild capital commitments now behind us, manageable leverage overall and no debt maturities until late 2017. 
Nonetheless, this attractive relative position should be taken into context of a challenged market, and therefore, we have responded to rightsize our cost structure for the environment, reducing both 2015 drilling expense and general and administrative expense guidance over the past 9 months by approximately 12% or $160 million and capital expenditures by 13% or $115 million. Certain of these actions such as reducing our shore-based headcount around the world by nearly 20% since January and eliminating certain compensations elements have been difficult decisions, but we have done what we need to do to maintain our strong franchise and attractive relative position. We believe these are extremely meaningful reductions, particularly in light of our relatively modest decline in activity levels. Given our view that we are unlikely to see a recovery in 2016, we will continue to hone our onshore cost structure, and to the extent activity levels remain low for prolonged periods of time, our offshore cost structure as well. However, we will not make any reductions that we expect would impact the safety of our people, the integrity of our equipment or the efficiency of our operations. 
We plan on providing 2016 cost guidance on our third quarter earnings call.

So I think, when we -- like I made in my comments, we've got  5 rigs stacked right now, 2 of them, both new rigs, less than about 5, 6 years old. I mean, and they're in Singapore, and they are -- we reduced the stacking cost on those significantly, and we've moved into stacking mode, meaning that we changed the maintenance plans, so it's more of an operating procedure. But those rigs could be reactivated fairly quickly. So we are -- the one good thing about jack-up is you can reduce costs on rigs by removing the crews and just focusing on purely preventive -- high-level preventive maintenance. So I'd say that we have stacked rigs, the 2 warm-stacked rigs in Southeast Asia, but we don't have full crews on them by any means. And we're not quite ready to take these up fully cold-stacked status because we've got some opportunity for them. And we're not going to talk about it, we are doing a lot of market checks. And they are desirable rigs. So if we were here 1 year from now or maybe 6 months from now and we still have no opportunity for those rigs, we'd probably take them down a level. In the Gulf of Mexico, it's a little different because there is opportunity, although there are rigs there, we have our other rigs. We are a little different as we have rigs that -- we have opportunities. And so a rig might -- it is somewhat difficult because we might have an opportunity, which we think is around the corner, and then it sort of drags out because of permits or whatever. But the Gulf of Mexico, we have taken 1 rig out of the fleet, and we're always looking at it as do we have the right number of rigs there? Some of the others like the North Sea, I mean, the Stavanger has just literally come off contract in the last week, and we've got some opportunities already. A bigger rig like that is definitely more expensive to stack. And so -- but we definitely evaluate it, and we're certainly not going to be scared or shy of cold-stacking rigs if we feel like it comes to that. Mark?"

And of course, in this environment, I think, we're likely to see distressed asses, and that could also be a very attractive way for us to increase our returns over time to the extent that we can find attractive assets that don't dilute our asset quality but that are at an attractive price.

I think, if you probably went through our investor decks over the last couple of years of what we thought our OpEx would be on our newbuild drillships, you'd probably see it drop down over the last -- because we weren't in the ultra-deepwater market, and so all of our cost analysis was basically bottoms-up. And we've -- and also, we were looking at a very tight labor market at the time. So I think our costs have come in a little bit lower. It's early days yet, and clearly, we are -- we've been in the ultra-deepwater market for just over 1 year with 1 rig, which was working in maybe in Angola and Canary Islands and Angola and now back to the U.S. And so that rig is around a bit. But I would say that I'm actually really pleased about how we've managed the cost and the repair and maintenance expense. And the real focus in our America deepwater group are being efficient and making sure that we spend enough and not overspend. Regarding the operating efficiency, I mean, actually, we've had a few subsea incidents where we basically downtime. And we expected those, but actually, it's been -- apart from the issue on the Reliance, it's been especially been working really well. I would say that we had the benefit of being a somewhat later entrant than some of our peers that a lot of issues are being knocked out. And so I do feel that our downtime has been less than expected. I think, we're saying -- I think, what we're saying in our fleet status about our deepwater downturn, that downtime is going to be the same, we're just holding with that, which, 6 months to 1 year, it should be within 95%. So I think, it's varied a bit, but I think we're still kind of on track with what we thought, although our costs are a little bit better than expected."

The second quarter continued our strong financial performance for 2015, with earnings of $0.68 per share. Highlights for the quarter included all of our 4 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships on rates by the end of the quarter, low out-of-service time and continued progress on cost control efforts. 
I'm proud of Rowan's highly successful entry into the ultra-deepwater arena. Through the diligent efforts of our employees, we have completed a significant newbuild program and now have 4 of the most viable high-specification drillships in the world to complement our high-specification jack-up fleet. This timely transformation has positioned us well to navigate the challenging market conditions in our industry. 
Our strong performance was also due to lower out-of-service time of approximately 2% in the quarter, an improvement from last quarter and below our previous guidance. This was helped in part by our operations and projects teams working diligently to minimize the operate time spent conducting statutory surveys and planned maintenance. 
While our current backlog provides us strength and stability over the next couple of years, we are mindful that several of our jack-ups are currently idled, and several others have contract renewals before the end of the year. As a result, our idle time for the quarter rose to 12%, up from 5% in the first quarter. Over the coming quarters, we expect our overall fleet utilization to remain under pressure, but we believe our high-specification rigs and dedication to safe and reliable operations will position us well when opportunities surface.
Today, we have 2 warm-stacked jack-ups in Southeast Asia where we continue to hold our stacking costs low and 3 ready-stacked jack-ups: one in North Africa; one in the U.K. sector of the North Sea; and one in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As you may have seen in our recent fleet status report, Repsol elected to terminate and pay out its contract for the Gorilla III in Trinidad. 
Following its planned demobilization back to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico later this month, this jack-up is at risk of joining the list of assets in our fleet that are warm or ready-stacked. 
The Rowan Louisiana remains cold-stacked in our Sabine yard, and we recently closed the sale of 2 of our oldest jack-ups: the Rowan Juneau and the Rowan Alaska. The sale agreement provides that these rigs are prohibited from operating as drilling units. As for the overall market, the upcoming deliveries of uncontracted newbuild jack-ups will add to the oversupply. However, we believe an even larger number of older jack-ups are primed to permanently exit the market. These retirements should pave the way for eventual improvement in the supply-demand balance. 
We continue to see the benefits of our cost-cutting initiatives in the second quarter with further reductions in operating expenses versus the first quarter, mainly driven by lower personnel-related costs. Accordingly, we have lowered our full year cost guidance. As mentioned on last quarter's call and worth repeating today, although we are focused on cost control, we continually communicate to our employees that the safety of personnel, protection of the marine environment and the operational integrity of our assets always come first. 
We remain in discussions with our customer over the influence on the Rowan Reliance early this year, and we hope to reach resolution in this in the near future. The North Platte #3 well has passed the depths of the North Platte #2 well when it was plugged and abandoned early in the second quarter. 
Unfortunately, beyond the further color that Stephen will provide in his prepared comments, we are not able to provide any more detailed comments on this matter until final resolution with the customer. 
Mark will provide our views about each of our markets of operation in a moment, but we continue to see our customers slow to bring additional demand for drilling services to the market, and we see risk of continued spending restraint into 2016 if commodity prices remains depressed through the budgeting season. 
However, we are starting to see signs from some of our customers that reduced service costs are beginning to make some additional drilling projects economic even without significant commodity price appreciation. 
For example, in the second quarter, you saw us make adjustments on 2 of our 3 ultra-harsh high-specification jack-ups in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, extending both contracts well into 2016 in exchange for some price relief in 2015. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. With our final drillship payment now behind us, we expect our credit ratios to continue to improve, further supporting our investment-grade credit rating. 
Finally, we are continuing reviewing our allocation with capital option. Our focus is on driving shareholder value over the long term and protecting our cash position. As the recent slide in oil prices back to near prior lows has reminded us, it's not yet clear when the offshore drilling market will improve. Accordingly, we will adjust our appetite and willingness to deploy capital when it becomes clear that doing so is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market, and then Stephen will give you details of our second quarter financial results and updated full year guidance for 2015. 
Thank you for your continued investments and interest in Rowan. Mark?"

Today, I will briefly discuss the jack-up market in general before making a few regional Rowan-specific remarks for the second quarter. I'll conclude with a few comments on the ultra-deepwater market. 
In the jack-up market, the second quarter showed a bit of improvement with regard to tender activity over the first quarter 2015. However, modest incremental demand was no match for the supply of jack-ups rolling off contract. Worldwide jack-up market utilization, which excludes cold-stacked units, is currently 83%, down from 84% at our last call and down from 91% this time last year. While jack-up contractors have started to remove units from the total fleet, albeit slower than the floater market, we're a long way from a balance in supply and demand. It's clear that the remainder of 2015 will be a challenge, and it seems that all eyes will be on commodity process as we enter the 2016 budget season to determine if there will be any signs of improvement in the next 18 months. 
Despite the difficult market, we remain confident in our stability as a company and our ability to manage through the cycle. 
That confidence comes from a more than 90-year history, a safe and reliable workforce and strong customer relationships. Our global diversification and solid backlog positions us well for the road to an eventual recovery. 
Despite the decrease in worldwide jack-up utilization, we were able to successfully roll 3 Rowan rigs under projects that extend past year-end 2015. Additionally, we added short-term contracts to 6 jack-ups. Though commercial terms continue to decline, we are pleased with the utilization we've been able to add to our fleet given these market conditions. 
Two of our longer-term extensions are in the North Sea. We were able to blend and extend the contracts for the Gorilla V and the Gorilla VII with their current operators, Total and Apache. The Rowan Stavanger is currently idle, but we're in discussions with several operators in the region for 2015 projects. We're confident that we can add utilization to the unit, though lower commercial terms are expected. 
I'll quickly mention the Middle East, though my comments will be brief given the sensitivity of ongoing discussions. In the second quarter, several short-term contract extensions were announced for our 116-Cs. The Arch Rowan, Charles Rowan and the Rowan Middletown are currently contracted through August 31, 2015. We are hopeful that our long-standing relationship with Saudi Aramco will lead to continued operations for these jack-ups. 
Turning to the Americas. As reported in the fleet status, the Joe Douglas will conclude operations with Rooster Petroleum this month and will prepare for mobilization from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Trinidad for an estimated contract commencement in early October for BHP Billiton. The Gorilla III is currently completing operations for the rig share group in Trinidad and will mobilize back to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the early termination and payout of the contract. 
Though we have witnessed some project deferrals, we remain modestly optimistic about the opportunities for idle jack-ups and those that will require additional work in 2015. It will be a fierce competition for whatever demand exists in the coming months, but we believe our highly capable fleet and solid relationships with the customers around the world gives us an advantage over our peer group. 
Shifting to the ultra-deepwater market. As Tom mentioned, we are proud of the completion of our ultra-deepwater newbuild program. The strategic vision set out in 2009 has been realized in all 4 of our dual-stacked, state-of-the-art drillships are now operating. We are grateful to the customers who are partnering in the inaugural operation of our ships and look forward to years of service with these great assets. 
Our drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, and we believe our contracts are solid. 
As it is a common question, I'll briefly address the topic of blend and extend. We are open to the idea and currently in communication with our customers about opportunities for future projects. The agreement will have to be favorable to both parties, and as expected, there is much discussion on what rates will look like in the 2017-2018 time frame. 
In the meantime, we are focused on operational execution on our ships to prove that our established operational excellence in the jack-up market has transitioned into the deepwater arena. 
In closing, despite the uncertainty of the duration of this cycle, Rowan's stability and strategic management of this difficult market will safeguard us until the inevitable recovery. 
We appreciate your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

This morning, I would like to walk you through our second quarter 2015 operating results in comparison to first quarter 2015 results. I will also provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the second quarter, we reported net income of $85 million or $0.68 per share, including an incremental $5 million or $0.02 per share as part of an estimated settlement related to a dispute on a prior jack-up refurbishment project versus $124 million or $0.99 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet that more than offset the incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships. 
Second quarter revenues were $496 million, excluding rebillable items, and about 8% lower than the first quarter 2015 revenues. An additional 26 operating days and nearly $15 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillship, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, but those failed to offset reduced contributions from our jack-ups. Our jack-up fleet generated nearly 200 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for various rigs, including the Joe Douglas, Gorilla IV and EXL I. 
Average jack-up day rates declined by 5% due to lower rates on certain new contract fixtures as well as a full quarter impact of lower rates on certain of our rigs working for Saudi Aramco. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 2% of our available rig days during the second quarter, which was slightly favorable versus our expectations as planned-to-operate inspection periods for certain rigs were delayed to future periods and, to a lesser extent, reduced or eliminated. Our operational downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, was slightly over 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 3% in total. 
Drillship downtime during the quarter of approximately 13% was adversely impacted by certain days at 0 rate assumed for an estimated period that remains under discussion with our customer for the Reliance related to the first quarter riser steel incident. We continue to believe that final resolution of the incident is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. 
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 12% of available days from 5% in the prior quarter. Two of the 3 rigs that drove most of the variance, the Joe Douglas and the Gorilla IV, have since returned to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, while the third rig, EXL I, remains warm-stacked with reduced crude levels in Southeast Asia. 
All in all, our marketed utilization rate was 82% in the second quarter versus 90% in the first quarter. 
Beginning with the third quarter 2015, our revenue should benefit from full quarter contribution from all our newbuild drillships, as our fourth vessel, the Relentless, commenced operations in mid-June. However, with 5 jack-up rigs idle today and an additional 8 with availability during the remainder of 2015, we will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts. Yet we also believe that certain of these rigs will remain contracted without interruption, and a number of other units will secure meaningful new work. 
Moving on to expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses were $241 million, excluding rebills,  an improvement of 2% from $245 million in the first quarter, despite approximately $6 million in additional costs related to our incremental drillship available days. These costs were more than offset by our ongoing cost control efforts on both active and idle rigs. 
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $1 billion to $1,010,000,000, which is $15 million to $20 million lower than our previous guidance. This guidance is due largely to the impact of our cost-reduction measures, including reduced personnel-related expenses, rig insurance and other expenses. 
Third quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $265 million to $270 million, up from second quarter levels, primarily due to the full quarter impact of operations for the Relentless and higher repairs and maintenance expense, mainly due to timing of certain activity. Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
Our second quarter SG&A expense totaled $31 million, which was generally in line with our previous guidance, but higher than the first quarter level, as the higher value of equity compensation expense related to liability-based awards offset our successful cost control measures. 
We continue to estimate that our full year 2015 SG&A expense will range from $115 million to $120 million, which is slightly lower than 2014 levels. 
We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $31 million in the third quarter 2015, in line with the level experienced in the second quarter. 
As I mentioned in my opening, second quarter results were adversely impacted by an estimated settlement for a dispute related to a refurbishment project on the Gorilla III during 2013 and 2014. The general contractor has asserted claims now totaling $25 million, exclusive of interest and legal costs. The company had previously accrued for an estimated liability and recognized an incremental $5 million during the second quarter. While the final outcome of this dispute is uncertain, we do not believe its resolution will have a material impact on our financial statement. 
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $95 million, in line with guidance but slightly higher than the first quarter level as a result of the Reliance and Relentless being placed into service during 2015. We continue to expect our full year 2015 depreciation expense will range from $385 million to $395 million, including approximately $102 million in the third quarter, also higher as a result of incurring a full quarter of depreciation related to the Relentless. 
Interest expense net of capitalized interest of $31 million during the second quarter was lower than the prior quarter due to higher levels of capitalized interest on the Relentless. This was at the high end of our previous guidance, as the vessel commenced operations earlier than estimated and less interest was capitalized. We continue to expect full year 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $145 million to $150 million. 
Now that our newbuild construction program is behind us and all of our ultra-deepwater drillships are in service, third quarter interest expense is expected to rise to $41 million as we stop capitalizing interest. 
Our second quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was slightly below previous guidance. We continue to expect our full year 2015 effective tax rate to range from 10% to 15%, with the third quarter rate slightly higher than the range and the fourth quarter rate back in the low teens. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $102 million in the second quarter, with approximately half relating to newbuild drillships and the other half for maintenance CapEx. We currently estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $750 million to $775 million, with approximately $615 million having already been incurred during the first half and more than 85% of that amount related to our final 2 newbuild drillships, including their mobilization, commissioning, fleet spares and associated costs prior to commencing operation. 
Other than approximately $35 million for residual newbuild-related costs, the remaining property additions during 2015 will primarily be for maintenance capital expenditures and fleet spares. 
Our liquidity remains strong. While our cash balance was only $200 million at quarter end, we maintained near full availability under our revolver as it was only reduced by a modest $50 million borrowing, which was still outstanding at quarter end. 
During the second quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion previously, and extended the maturity by 1 year to January 2020. Borrowing capacity for the final year of the agreement declined by $60 million to $1.44 billion. 
We continue to believe this considerable increase in our liquidity enhances our flexibility during this downturn. 
Given the growth in offshore rig supply over the last several years, coupled with declining oil prices over the past year and a swift budgetary response by operators, it is no surprise that 2015 continues to be a challenging year for the industry. Unfortunately, with crude prices recently taking another leg down following a rally in the spring, we are now likely to see further capital expenditure reductions by many operators in 2016, again, pressuring our industry further. 
Rowan was already well-positioned relative to many of our peers prior to this challenging business climate, as we expect to be one of the few companies in the sector to post higher recurring earnings during 2015 despite the downturn. We are also one of the few players in the industry with our deepwater fleet fully contracted well into 2017 and beyond, our newbuild capital commitments now behind us, manageable leverage overall and no debt maturities until late 2017. 
Nonetheless, this attractive relative position should be taken in the context of a challenged market, and therefore, we have responded to rightsize our cost structure for the environment, reducing both 2015 drilling expense and general and administrative expense guidance over the past 9 months by approximately 12% or $160 million and capital expenditures by 13% or $115 million. Certain of these actions such as reducing our shore-based headcount around the world by nearly 20% since January and eliminating certain compensations elements have been difficult decisions, but we have done what we need to do to maintain our strong franchise and attractive relative position. We believe these are extremely meaningful reductions, particularly in light of our relatively modest decline in activity levels. Given our view that we are unlikely to see a recovery in 2016, we will continue to hone our onshore cost structure, and to the extent activity levels remain low for prolonged periods of time, our offshore cost structure as well. However, we will not make any reductions that we expect would impact the safety of our people, the integrity of our equipment or the efficiency of our operations. 
We plan on providing 2016 cost guidance on our third quarter earnings call. 
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

So I think, when we -- like I made in my comments, we've got  5 rigs stacked right now; 2 of them are both new rigs, less than about 5, 6 years old. I mean, and they're in Singapore, and they are -- we reduced the stacking costs on those significantly, and we've moved into stacking mode, meaning that we changed the maintenance plans, so it's more of an operating procedure. But those rigs could be reactivated fairly quickly. So we are -- the one good thing about jack-up is you can reduce costs on rigs by removing the crews and just focusing on purely preventative -- high-level preventative maintenance. So I'd say that we have stacked rigs, the 2 warm-stacked rigs in Southeast Asia, but we don't have full crews on them by any means. And we're not quite ready to take things to fully cold-stacked status because we've got some opportunity for them. And we're not going to talk about it, but we are doing a lot of market checks and they are desirable rigs. So if we were here a year from now or maybe 6 months from now and we still have no opportunity for those rigs, we'd probably take them down a level. In the Gulf of Mexico, it's a little different because there is opportunity, although there are -- which is where we have our other rigs. We are a little different as we have rigs that -- we have opportunities. And so a rig might -- it is somewhat difficult because we might have an opportunity, which we think is around the corner, and then it sort of drags out because of permits or whatever. But the Gulf of Mexico, we have taken 1 rig out of the fleet, and we're always looking at it as do we have the right number of rigs there? Some of the others like the North Sea, I mean, the Stavanger has just literally come off contract in the last week, and we've got some opportunities already. A bigger rig like that is definitely more expensive to stack. And so -- but we definitely evaluate it, and we're certainly not going to be scared or shy of cold-stacking rigs if we feel like it comes to that. Mark?"

And we continue to evaluate all of our options for deploying that, whether it's, again, paying down debt, as you mentioned, or buying back stock, changing the dividend policy. And of course, in this environment, I think, we're likely to see distressed assets, and that could also be a very attractive way for us to increase our returns over time to the extent that we can find attractive assets that don't dilute our asset quality but that are at an attractive price. So really, it's a key issue for the management team here as well as the board, and we're going to continue to spend a lot of time evaluating those options.

I'd say, just on the cost side, I think we were probably a bit more conservative when we were doing our planning from where our costs have come out. I think, if you probably went through our investor decks over the last couple of years of what we thought our OpEx would be on our newbuild drillships, you'd probably see it drop down over the last -- because we weren't in the ultra-deepwater market, and so all of our cost analysis was basically bottoms-up. And we've -- and also, we were looking at a very tight labor market at the time. So I think our costs have come in a little bit lower. It's early days yet, and clearly, we are -- we've been in the ultra-deepwater market for just over a year with 1 rig, which was working in Namibia, and then Angola, then Canary Islands, and then Angola and now back to the U.S. And so that rig has been moved around a bit. But I would say that I'm actually really pleased about how we've managed the cost and the repair and maintenance expense. And the real focus in our America deepwater group are being efficient and making sure that we spend enough and not overspend. Regarding the operating efficiency, I mean, actually, we've had a few subsea incidents where we basically downtime. And we expected those, but actually, it's been -- apart from the issue on the Reliance, it's been especially been working really well. I would say that we had the benefit of being a somewhat later entrant than some of our peers, that a lot of these issues had been knocked out. And so I do feel that our downtime has been less than expected. I think we're saying -- I think what we're saying in our fleet status about our deepwater downturn -- downtime is going to be the same. We're just holding with that, which, 6 months to 1 year, it should be within 95%. So I think it's varied a bit, but I think we're still kind of on track with what we thought, although our costs are a little bit better than expected."

There are a lot of factors taken into account in that negotiation. And I think our marketing did -- our team did a really nice job working with Total to understand their limitations, and they understand what we wanted. It's actually -- the rig is actually on location for the rest of the year. And it's actually doing a number of repairs and other things during the remainder of the year. So it's not in full-fledged drilling mode, and we're taking the opportunity to do some needed maintenance on the rig. But also, we didn't take the rig off the platform. And you've seen in our results historically that it can really be tough getting a rig on location in the middle of the winter in the North Sea. So by keeping the rig there even though we're doing some maintenance on the rig is sort of a win-win for both sides, where they know that they can get the rig going as soon as they're -- in 2016. And then actually, we get to keep it on location and do some work on it. So it was definitely a win-win, and we're really pleased that we've managed to, like Mark said, keep that rig working for Total in lieu of the tough market."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the Offshore drilling market. And then Stephen",584,"Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan. 
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the Offshore drilling market. And then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.
We had a terrific third quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings normalized to certain items which Stephen will address shortly were $0.89 per share, up from $0.70 [ph] per share in the second quarter on a normalized basis. We achieved this strong performance mainly due to all 4 of our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate -- operating in the Gulf of Mexico for the third [ph] quarter and great progress in our onshore and offshore cost control initiatives. 
The third quarter also benefited from continued low out-of-service time of approximately 3%, an outstanding uptime performance for both our jack-ups, with operational downtime of 1%; and our drillships, with operational downtime of 4%. Our strong contract backlog, which currently exceeds $4 billion, provides us with earnings and free cash flow stability for the next few years. We are actively marketing our high-spec jack-ups and are in discussion with customers to extend certain of our deepwater contracts in a mutually beneficial manner. We are hopeful we will be able to find common ground.
Though we've continued to face headwinds in the jack-up market, we added 9 rig years of backlog in the Middle East and a new 10 month contract for the Gorilla VI in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We currently have 4 already stacked high-specification jack-ups around the world. While we continue to market these rigs in their current regions, over the coming quarters we may choose to relocate 1 or more of them contracting opportunities in other market. Mark will be giving you details of such a move. 
Given the excess capacity in the industry and our desire to reduce cost, we cold stacked the probe lines and the Gorilla II during the quarter. Our cost control initiatives continue to be effective and as a result we are further reducing our full year 2015 operating expense guidance which Stephen will detail later in the call. He will also lay out our initial operating expense guidance for 2016.
To reiterate what I said last quarter, we believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing costs where possible while maintaining our focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
In summary, I'm pleased with our operational performance and cost management this far and we will continue to focus on solid execution and margins over the coming quarters.
Mark will walk you through the market details of our operating regions, but we can see that 2016 will be challenging as our customers continue to delay program and cut their drilling costs.
We will continue to review our capital allocation choices, including potentially buying distressed assets, retiring debt and/or repurchasing equity when market conditions warrant. However, we believe that the current low visibility on recovery in the offshore drilling market demands caution. In the challenging market we anticipate in 2016, we will focus on improving our already solid balance sheet.
Earlier this month, we were pleased to see Moody's confirm our investment-grade credit rating although with a negative outlook. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market. Thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Mark?"

My comments will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the volatility of the current market. I will mention our ultra-deepwater position and then discuss the jack-up market in more detail, given that our near-term marketing efforts are strongly focused on the rollover of our high-spec assets. 
2016 is forecast to be another challenging year and we are pleased that 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are fully booked into 2017 or beyond.
The timing and execution of our newbuild program, combined with strong contracts and valued customers, have positioned us well to ride out the trough of this cycle.
As Tom mentioned, we have approached the subject of blend and extend with all of our ultra-deepwater customers about opportunities to help them live within their current budgetary restraints and encourage future exploration drilling in exchange for additional term to the original contract. Discussions are ongoing and we are optimistic that we can reach mutually acceptable terms with some of our customers.
Moving on to the jack-up market. Worldwide jack-up utilization has seen additional pressure since our last call and has decreased 5%. There are approximately 100 marketed units not currently contracted and many rigs in the active fleet that will be seeking renewals in the coming years.
Our global marketing team is creatively approaching each and every opportunity available, leveraging Rowan's long-standing reputation as a leading jack-up operator.
Our efforts are centered on our high-spec units, which we believe will provide the most earnings potential in the future.
We have made some difficult but educated decisions to cold stack some of our older rigs so that utilization can be focused on our premium jack-ups. We currently have 4 high-spec specification units that are not contracted. And while projects in 2015 are sparse, we are hopeful for opportunities for these jack-ups in 2016.
We've recently decided to mobilize the Ralph Coffman from the Mediterranean to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which we expect to take place during the fourth quarter.
We are proud of the HPHT that the rig and crew have accomplished in the region. But given the demand decline in the area, we believe there are better opportunities for a contract in the Americas. 
The J.P. Bussell was also strategically relocated since our last call from Southeast Asia to the Middle East where it is currently available.
To reiterate Tom's remarks, we are pleased to extend 3 of our 116C contracts with Saudi Aramco adding significant backlog in the region.
As a reminder, the government is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco and other regional customers about opportunities for this rig. The Middle East is one of the few regions in the world that has a projected increase in demand for 2016 and we are well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arise.
We are one of the few jack-up contractors with rigs currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We cold stacked and transferred its deal with work to the DXL3, which concluded operations at the end of October.
The Gorilla 3 is completing the remainder of a contract with petroleum previously drilled by the Joe Douglas. The Gorilla 4 is currently working for Energy 21 and we recently announced the contract in direct continuation with Marine Energy for an estimated duration of 10 months. Demand in the region is currently 8 units and is expected to stay flat throughout 2016.
The Joe Douglas relocated the Trinidad and commenced operations for BHP since our last call and are glad to add another unit to that market. We deem Trinidad as a bright spot for jack-ups with high-spec capability and a robust leg and jacking structure.
There is no question that 2015 has been a difficult year and that 2016 looks to further test the fortitude of our industry. However, I believe this cycle will clearly differentiate those companies such as Rowan that have made prudent business decisions through the up cycles and the troughs of the past and they will emerge even stronger.
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,289877699,890102,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call",1725,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the third quarter we reported a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $274 million net of tax, a $75 million income tax charge related to evaluation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge also net of tax versus income of $85 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included a $5 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter versus $88 million or $0.70 per share in the second quarter.
The increase is primarily attributable to the incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships and our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet. 
During the third quarter, we generated revenues of $534 million, excluding rebillable items, about 8% higher than second quarter 2015 levels. An additional 97 operating days and about $57 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillships, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, which both commenced operations this year.
Our jack-up fleet generated 65 fewer operating days, primarily due to the -- due to increased idle time for the Ralph Coffman and Rowan Stavanger along with the cold stacking of the Cecil Provine and Rowan Gorilla 2, somewhat offset by increased operating days on the Gorilla 4 and Joe Douglas.
Our average jack-up day rates declined modestly by 3% due to lower rates on new contracts and the impact of idle time for certain rigs.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance.
Our operational downtime in which is unbillable downtime -- unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total.
Operational downtime for our drillships was approximately 4%, much better than earlier start up guidance of 10% for the first year of operation.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 13% of available days from 12% in the prior quarter.
We have reduced the manning levels and operating costs of our 4 idle jack-ups. All in all, our marketable utilization rate was 80% in the third quarter, in line with 81% achieved in the second quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses were $236 million excluding rebills, and an improvement of 2% from $241 million in the second quarter, despite approximately $10 million in cost-related to our incremental drillship available days for the Rowan Relentless, which was more than offset by our ongoing cost control efforts that resulted in a $15 million reduction.
We estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $965 million to $970 million, which is $35 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to reduced personnel related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $245 million to $250 million, up slightly from third quarter levels primarily due to the timing of certain repair and maintenance activities.
Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our third quarter SG&A expense totaled $29 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance in the second quarter level, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to certain liability-based awards and the impact of our cost control measures.
We estimate our full year 2015 SG&A expense to be $118 [ph] million, slightly lower than 2014 levels. We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, slightly higher than the level experienced in the third quarter.
As I mentioned in my opening, third quarter results were adversely impacted by a $330 million pretax, noncash asset impairment charge. The impairment relates to 10 jack-up rigs and primarily results from a sharp decline in crude oil prices during the third quarter and our expectations that our customers will continue to reduce capital spending in 2015 with further meaningful reductions in 2016, which we believe would be the first back-to-back decline in operator capital spending in over 20 years.
Also during the third quarter and primarily as a result of the impairment charge, a valuation allowance of $75 million has been recorded for [indiscernible] in order to measure only a portion of the deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized.
However, the amount of evaluation allowance could be adjusted if estimates of future U.S. taxable income carryforward period are increased. Additionally, the valuation allowance may be adjusted once the recent cumulative losses are no longer present as additional weight may be given to other factors such as our projection for future income.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $104 million, slightly higher than our guidance and higher than second quarter levels, as a result of the Rowan Relentless being placed into service during the second quarter. We forecast our full year 2015 depreciation expense to be slightly over $390 million, including $102 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense, which was $41 million during the third quarter was in line with our previous guidance and was higher than the prior quarter as we stopped capitalizing interest during the second quarter when the Rowan Relentless commenced operation. We expect full year 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $146 million in the fourth quarter to be flat with third quarter levels.
Excluding the impact of the noncash asset impairment charge and the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, our third quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was below our previous guidance due to the impact of projected operating results, jurisdictional mix as well as certain discrete items.
We expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens, again excluding the impact of the impairment and valuation allowance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $53 million in the third quarter with approximately $11 million relating to our 4 newbuild drillships, and the remainder primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. We estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $740 million to $745 million, with approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and fleet spares. 
Excluding newbuild spend, 2015 capital expenditures are estimated at $175 million. And I think it's notable that all of our newbuild CapEx is now behind us and that's somewhat unique within our sector.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, with cash increasing by approximately $90 million despite our repayment of $50 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
At quarter end we had nearly $300 million in cash and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn, providing comfortable levels of liquidity in an uncertain but potentially target-rich environment.
All in all, our 2015 results are benefiting from strong execution by our projects and deepwater teams, with early deliveries on our last 2 ships and with excellent uptimes during initial deepwater operations. Our results have also been bolstered by our swift cost-reduction measures.
Since our initial 2015 guidance provided in November of last year, we've reduced 2015 operating expense guidance by $175 million or 16%. Our SG&A guidance has declined by $17 [ph] million, or 12%; and finally, our maintenance CapEx guidance has been reduced by $70 [ph] million or 25%.
Although we've not completed our 2016 and will budget process, we are providing preliminary guidance which we will update in our next quarterly call.
As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we had all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 11 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
This $4.1 billion in backlog provides Rowan with excellent visibility, however, we certainly have our work cut out for us on the remaining 14 [ph] marketed jack-ups which have availability in 2016.
We will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry work through its excess capacity and demand begins to recover. 
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $930 million to $950 million, which is a 2% to 4% decline from the estimated 2015 level, despite having a full year of expenses from 2 drillships which commenced operations during 2015. We estimate the full year impact of our last 2 drillships will increase expenses by approximately $30 million. Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline approximately $60 million to $65 million, or 6% year-over-year as a result of reduced costs associated with idle jack-ups, a full year impact of cost control measures instituted during 2015 on working rigs and in our shore basis, and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by 3% to 11% and range from $105 million to $115 million.
Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $405 million to $415 million as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge.
Our 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $160 million to $165 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level as we do not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016.
We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $175 million to $200 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arise due to our secure additional work, none of which is currently planned.
We will refine this 2016 guidance in our next earnings call after we've completed our annual budgeting process.

So that argument that all the value, all the cost reductions don't -- ultimately it all benefits the operator, I don't really buy it. Either way, we have to do it anyway, right? To be competitive, right? So we had to do it. But on the other hand, we're not seeing -- we're not seeing rates drop that low. And I'd also say, which number of investments I've pointed out, although these costs reduction of rates are very difficult. When the rebound comes and we do believe it will, then we will see obviously massive margin expansion because the costs won't go up as fast as the day rates go up.

So the real point is when we stack rigs, obviously, what we know the big question is how quickly do we change the accruing level on those rigs. And that really obviously depends upon which region that rig is in. Because sometimes, when we use contract labor particularly in Southeast Asia and a couple of places. But when we stacked rigs, how quickly do we change, particularly the junior crews, how quickly do we cut costs? And obviously, when you spent years building experience to have a world-class drilling company and that experience is our senior leaders on the rigs to lay them off, it's a very difficult decision. So we do a lot of bump back strategies where we basically push people down. And also we do spend a lot of time looking through our work force and looking at nonperformers, all of which, its easy to say -- it's easy to say to really fast, but it's actually very difficult to do. And so we've been doing a lot of that. The onshore costs are a bit harder to change because they -- at least they're not clearly bearable as the offshore cost. And so the onshore cost, you have to kind of stand back and look at making structural changes over time. And so I'd say the onshore cost is pretty sticky, but we're -- but there, everything is bearable in the long term, right? So sort of looking at our onshore cost and looking at how we can centralize back-office functions and try to improve or reduce the support cost without reducing the effectiveness of the onshore cost -- on for support capability. So it's difficult. But we've done it for some time now. We know when a lot of the other moves we can make are and we just have to do them slowly and carefully."

We like the floating market, but we like the jack up market. So we look at those both as their they compete with us and ultimately, could they be part of our fleet. So we do see that as an opportunity. We also think of them as a threat. We actually did send a construction manager earlier on this year to go and look at the quality of the construction in multiple yards to sort of try and assess them. We get a lots of intelligence, which is obviously the same as all of our competitors get about who's doing what. And I probably get 2 or 3 emails every week telling me the status of the rigs that's being built in China, probably you do as well. But I would say that -- of that number, that some is going to go to domestic market, right? And when you high grade the asset, the rigs that's being built by someone that's never owned a rig, by a project team that is very small a shipyard that has never built a rig, is definitely going to be -- the chances of it being super successful or the first couple of them at the gate are going to be lower. Some of those probably go to domestic market, domestic Chinese market. Of the remainder -- and I see different numbers of what, how many they are, maybe 80 rigs, maybe its 90. I guess most of them get built fairly far along. But I would say that I just don't see them coming out of the shipyard anytime soon. One of our competitor CEOs, Carl Tral, made a comment, which I thought was very funny. Amateur hour is over, right? So if you're turning up -- if you're Rowan turning up with some jack-ups, Chinese are building in Singapore or anyone else, that's one thing to a major IOC or NOC. But if you're a dream company that's nobody heard of, it's probably hard to sell particularly during the type of work that we're really focused on, the high temperature, high pressure work, they've got more chance. I do think most rigs eventually come in the market. But I don't see them coming in anytime, not a bunch of them kind of wanting to swamp the market. And our Investor Relations Manager, Chris Pitre, put up an interesting slide on our Investor Day, which basically shows where they are going to be delivered and when they are being delivered. And so I see it as a bit of [indiscernible] they're going to come -- they'll get pushed to the right. And as they need, they'll enter the market, but not in the fore.

It depends on what type of rigs are required, what term of the contract is. I could see the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as you've seen day rates where commodity rigs can do the majority of the work. You're going to approach cash cost a lot quicker. When you're in a market where you need high-spec, harsh environment rigs, the market is going to resist going down to that level because there is not that many of those rigs. If you're working in an area like the Middle East with Aramco that has very stringent requirements, tender requirements, you're obviously going to receive higher day rates particularly if you're grilling gas flows. Same thing with West Africa with some of the high grading that's taking place there. They're requiring a different type of rig, so that's going to take you to a different market and that will yield a different -- certainly a lot of higher margin in those regions. But Southeast Asia, as I mentioned earlier to JB's question, one of the reasons that we're looking at taking the XLs out of Southeast Asia because that market is rapidly becoming a more commodity market. Petra Noss is allowing new entrants to bid that aren't established companies. So that changes that landscape rapidly and could drive the market more closely to cash cost.

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan.Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen",584,"Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan.
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.
We had a terrific third quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings normalized for certain items, which Stephen will address shortly, were $0.89 per share, up from $0.70 per share in the second quarter on a normalized basis. We achieved this strong performance mainly due to all 4 of our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the third quarter and great progress in our onshore and offshore cost-control initiatives.
The third quarter also benefited from continued low out-of-service time of approximately 3%, an outstanding uptime performance for both our jack-ups, with operational downtime of 1%; and our drillships, with operational downtime of 4%. Our strong contract backlog, which currently exceed $4 billion, provides us with earnings and free cash flow stability for the next few years. We are actively marketing our high-spec jack-ups and are in discussions with customers to extend certain of our deepwater contracts in a mutually beneficial manner. We are hopeful that we will be able to find common ground.
Though we continue to face headwinds in the jack-up market, we added 9 rig years of backlog in the Middle East and a new 10-month contract for the Rowan Gorilla IV in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We currently have 4 warm or ready stacked high-specification jack-ups around the world. While we continue to market these rigs in their current regions, over the coming quarters, we may choose to relocate one or more of them for contracting opportunities in other market. Mark will be giving you details of such a move.
Given the excess capacity in the industry and our desire to reduce cost, we cold stacked the Cecil Provine and the Gorilla II during the quarter. Our cost-control initiatives continue to be effective and as a result, we are further reducing our full year 2015 operating expense guidance, which Stephen will detail later in the call. He will also lay out our initial operating expense guidance for 2016.
To reiterate what I said last quarter, we believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing cost where possible while maintaining our focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
In summary, I'm pleased with our operational performance and cost management thus far, and we will continue to focus on solid execution and margins over the coming quarters.
Mark will walk you through the market details of our operating regions, but we can see that 2016 will be challenging as our customers continue to delay program and cut their drilling costs.
We will continue to review our capital allocation choices, including potentially buying distressed assets, retiring debt and/or repurchasing equity when market conditions warrant. However, we believe that the current low visibility on recovery in the offshore drilling market demands caution. In the challenging market we anticipate in 2016, we will focus on improving our already solid balance sheet.
Earlier this month, we were pleased to see Moody's confirm our investment-grade credit rating, although with a negative outlook.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for an update on the market. Thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Mark?"

My comments will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the volatility of the current market. I will mention our ultra-deepwater position and then discuss the jack-up market in more detail, given that our near-term marketing efforts are strongly focused on the rollover of our high-spec assets.
2016 is forecast to be another challenging year, and we are pleased that our 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are fully booked into 2017 or beyond.
The timing and execution of our newbuild program, combined with strong contracts and valued customers, have positioned us well to ride out the trough of this cycle.
As Tom mentioned, we have approached the subject of blend and extend with all of our ultra-deepwater customers about opportunities to help them live within their current budgetary restraints and encourage future exploration drilling in exchange for additional term to the original contract. Discussions are ongoing, and we are optimistic that we can reach mutually acceptable terms with some of our customers.
Moving on to the jack-up market. Worldwide jack-up market utilization has seen additional pressure since our last call and has decreased 5%. There are approximately 100 marketed units not currently contracted and many rigs in the active fleet that will be seeking renewals in the coming year.
Our global marketing team is creatively approaching each and every opportunity available, leveraging Rowan's long-standing reputation as a leading jack-up operator. Our efforts are centered on our high-spec units, which we believe will provide the most earnings potential in the future.
We have made some difficult but educated decisions to cold stack some of our older rigs so that utilization can be focused on our premium jack-ups. We currently have 4 high-spec specification units that are not contracted. And while projects in 2015 are sparse, we are hopeful for opportunities for these jack-ups in 2016.
We've recently decided to mobilize the Ralph Coffman from the Mediterranean to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which we expect to take place during the fourth quarter. We are proud of the HPHT work that the rig and crew have accomplished in the region, but given the demand decline in the area, we believe there are better opportunities for a contract in the Americas.
The J.P. Bussell was also strategically relocated since our last call from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, where it is currently available.
To reiterate Tom's remarks, we are pleased to extend 3 of our 116-C contracts with Saudi Aramco, adding significant backlog in the region.
As a reminder, the Gilbert Rowe is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco and other regional customers about future opportunities for this rig. The Middle East is one of the few regions in the world that has a projected increase in demand for 2016, and we are well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arise.
We are one of the few jack-up contractors with rigs currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We cold stacked the Cecil Provine and transferred its Fieldwood work to the EXL III, which concluded operations at the end of October.
The Gorilla III is completing the remainder of a contract with Rooster Petroleum previously drilled by the Joe Douglas. The Gorilla IV is currently working for Energy XXI, and we recently announced a contract in direct continuation with Arena Energy for an estimated duration of 10 months. Demand in the region is currently 8 units and is expected to stay flat throughout 2016.
The Joe Douglas relocated to Trinidad and commenced operations for BHP since our last call, and we are glad to add another unit to that market. We view Trinidad as a bright spot for jack-ups with high-spec capability and a robust leg and jacking structure.
There is no question that 2015 has been a difficult year and that 2016 looks to further test the fortitude of our industry. However, I believe this cycle will clearly differentiate those companies such as Rowan that have made prudent business decisions through the up cycles and the troughs of the past, and they will emerge even stronger.
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,289877699,890576,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call",1714,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
For the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $274 million net of tax, a $75 million income tax charge related to a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge also net of tax versus income of $85 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included a $5 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter versus $88 million or $0.70 per share in the second quarter.
The increase is primarily attributable to the incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships and our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet.
During the third quarter, we generated revenues of $534 million, excluding rebillable items, about 8% higher than second quarter 2015 levels. An additional 97 operating days and about $57 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillships, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, which both commenced operations this year.
Our jack-up fleet generated 65 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for the Ralph Coffman and Rowan Stavanger, along with the cold stacking of the Cecil Provine and Rowan Gorilla II, somewhat offset by increased operating days on the Gorilla IV and Joe Douglas.
Our average jack-up day rates declined modestly by 3% due to lower rates on new contracts and the impact of idle time for certain rigs.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance.
Our operational downtime, which is unbillable downtime -- unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total.
Operational downtime for our drillships was approximately 4%, much better than earlier startup guidance of 10% for the first year of operation.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 13% of available days from 12% in the prior quarter.
We have reduced the manning levels and operating costs of our 4 idle jack-ups. All in all, our marketed utilization rate was 80% in the third quarter, in line with 81% achieved in the second quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses were $236 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of 2% from $241 million in the second quarter, despite approximately $10 million in costs related to our incremental drillship available days for the Rowan Relentless, which was more than offset by our ongoing cost-control efforts that resulted in a $15 million reduction.
We estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $965 million to $970 million, which is $35 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to reduced personnel-related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $245 million to $250 million, up slightly from third quarter levels, primarily due to the timing of certain repair and maintenance activities.
Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our third quarter SG&A expense totaled $29 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance in the second quarter level, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to certain liability-based awards and the impact of our cost-control measures.
We estimate our full year 2015 SG&A expense to be $118 million, slightly lower than 2014 levels. We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, slightly higher than the level experienced in the third quarter.
As I mentioned in my opening, third quarter results were adversely impacted by a $330 million pretax, noncash asset impairment charge. The impairment relates to 10 jack-up rigs and primarily results from the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the third quarter and our expectations that our customers will continue to reduce capital spending in 2015, with further meaningful reductions in 2016, which we believe would be the first back-to-back decline in operator capital spending in over 20 years.
Also during the third quarter and primarily as a result of the impairment charge, a valuation allowance of $75 million has been recorded for [indiscernible] in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized.
However, the amount of the valuation allowance could be adjusted if estimates of future U.S. taxable income during the carryforward period are increased. Additionally, the valuation allowance may be adjusted once the recent cumulative losses are no longer present as additional weight may be given to other factors such as our projection for future income.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $104 million, slightly higher than our guidance and higher than second quarter levels, as a result of the Rowan Relentless being placed into service during the second quarter. We forecast our full year 2015 depreciation expense to be slightly over $390 million, including $102 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense, which was $41 million during the third quarter was in line with our previous guidance and was higher than the prior quarter as we stopped capitalizing interest during the second quarter when the Rowan Relentless commenced operation. We expect full year 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $146 million in the fourth quarter to be flat with third quarter levels.
Excluding the impact of the noncash asset impairment charge and the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, our third quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was below our previous guidance due to the impact of projected operating results, jurisdictional mix as well as certain discrete items.
We expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens, again, excluding the impact of the impairment and valuation allowance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $53 million in the third quarter, with approximately $11 million relating to our fourth newbuild drillship, and the remainder primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. We estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $740 million to $745 million, with approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and fleet spares.
Excluding newbuild spend, 2015 capital expenditures are estimated at $175 million. And I think it's notable that all of our newbuild CapEx is now behind us and that's somewhat unique within our sector.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, with cash increasing by approximately $90 million despite our repayment of $50 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
At quarter end, we had nearly $300 million in cash and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn, providing comfortable levels of liquidity in an uncertain but potentially target-rich environment.
All in all, our 2015 results are benefiting from strong execution by our projects and deepwater teams, with early deliveries on our last 2 ships and with excellent uptime during initial deepwater operations. Our results have also been bolstered by our swift cost-reduction measures.
Since our initial 2015 guidance provided in November of last year, we've reduced 2015 operating expense guidance by $175 million or 16%. Our SG&A guidance has declined by $17 million or 12%. And finally, our maintenance CapEx guidance has been reduced by $70 million or 25%.
Although we've not completed our 2016 annual budget process, we are providing preliminary guidance, which we will update in our next quarterly call.
As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we have all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 11 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
This $4.1 billion in backlog provides Rowan with excellent visibility. However, we certainly have our work cut out for us on the remaining 14 marketed jack-ups, which have availability in 2016.
We will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry works through its excess capacity and demand begins to recover.
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $930 million to $950 million, which is a 2% to 4% decline from the estimated 2015 level, despite having a full year of expenses from 2 drillships which commenced operations during 2015. We estimate the full year impact of our last 2 drillships will increase expenses by approximately $30 million. Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline approximately $60 million to $65 million or 6% year-over-year as a result of reduced cost associated with idle jack-ups, a full year impact of cost-control measures instituted during 2015 on working rigs and in our shore base, and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by 3% to 11% and range from $105 million to $115 million.
Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $405 million to $415 million as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge.
Our 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $160 million to $165 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level as we do not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016.
We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $175 million to $200 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arise due to our securing additional work, none of which is currently planned.
We will refine this 2016 guidance in our next earnings call after we've completed our annual budgeting process.
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

This is something clearly that you need to do, the same for all of your peers. But as costs are getting reduced, it seems to us that the value created likely just passes through to the operators in the form of lower and lower day rates. So this is probably a bigger challenge for near term for your competitors that have uncontracted floaters. But does the lower cost base for the industry allow more rigs to stay ready stacked longer and therefore push out the market-clearing process?"

And so that argument that all the value, all the cost reductions don't -- ultimately, it all benefits the operator, I don't really buy it. Either way, we have to do it anyway, right, to be competitive, right? So we had to do it. But on the other hand, we're not seeing -- we aren't seeing rates drop that low. And I'd also say, which a number of investors have pointed out is that although these cost reductions are very tough and very difficult, when the rebound comes and we do believe it will, then we will see obviously massive margin expansion because the costs won't go up as fast as the day rates go up. That's a positive spin on that, Sean."

So the real point is, I guess, when we stack rigs, obviously, what -- the big question is, is how quickly do we change the crewing levels on those rigs. And that really obviously depends a lot about which region that rig is in because sometimes we use contract labor, particularly in Southeast Asia and a couple of other places. But when we stack a rig, how quickly do we change, particularly the junior crews, how quickly do we cut cost? And obviously, when we've been -- we've spent years building experience to have a world-class drilling company and that experience is our senior leaders on the rig. To lay them off, it's a very difficult decision. So we do a lot of bump back strategies, where we basically push people down. And we also do -- spend a lot of time looking through our workforce and working with your nonperformers, all of which, it's easy to say -- it's easy to say it really fast, but it's actually very difficult to do. And so we've been doing a lot of that. The onshore costs are a bit harder to change because they -- at least they're not as clearly variable as the offshore cost. And so the onshore cost, you have to kind of stand back and look at making structural changes over time. And so I'd say the onshore cost is pretty sticky, but everything is variable in the long term, right? So we're sort of looking at our onshore cost and working out how we can centralize back-office functions and try to improve or reduce the support cost without reducing the effectiveness of the onshore cost -- of the onshore support capability. So it's difficult, but we've done it for some time now. We know what are a lot of the other moves we can make are and we just have to do them slowly and carefully."

On the other hand, an opportunity because we obviously clearly like the jack-up market. We like the floating market, but we like the jack-up market. And so we look at those both as, could they compete with us? And ultimately, could they be part of our fleet? So we do think of them as an opportunity. We also think of them as a threat. We actually did send a construction manager earlier on this year to go and look at the quality of the construction in multiple yards to sort of try and assess them. We get a lot of intelligence, which is obviously the same as all of our competitors get, about who's doing what. And I probably get 2 or 3 emails every week telling me the status of every rig that's being built in China, probably you do as well. But I would say that -- of that number, there's some that's going to go into the domestic market, right? And when you high grade the asset, the rig that's being built by someone that's never owned a rig, by a project team which is very small, in a shipyard that has never built a rig, is definitely going to be -- the chances of it being super successful or the first couple of them out of the gate are going to be lower. So some of those would probably go to domestic market, to the domestic Chinese market. Of the remainder -- and I've seen different numbers of what, how many they are. Maybe it's 80, right? Maybe it's 90. I think most of them get built because they're fairly far along, but I would say that I just don't see them coming out of the shipyard anytime soon. One of our competitor CEOs, Carl Trowell, made a comment, which I thought was very funny. He said, ""Amateur hour is over, right?"" And so if you're turning up -- if you're Rowan turning up with some jack-ups, Chinese or built in Singapore or anywhere else, that's one thing to a major IOC or NOC. But if you're a drilling company that no one else has heard of, it's probably a lot harder to sell, particularly if you're doing the type of work that we're really focused on, the high temperature, high pressure work. And if you're doing coastal, then maybe they've got more chance. So I do think that those rigs will eventually come in the market, but I don't see them coming in Anytime. There's not like a bunch of them kind of wanting to swamp the market. And our Investor Relations Manager, Chris Pitre, put up an interesting slide on our investor deck, which basically shows when they said they were going to be delivered and when they are going to being delivered or what they now say they're going to be delivered. And so I see it as a bit of a bow wave, right? They're going to come -- they'll get pushed to the right. And as they're needed, they'll enter the market, but not before.

Budgets, however, we are looking at some opportunities for the Stavanger to put it back to work. We are also looking at a couple of opportunities to take rigs out of the North Sea on a term basis. And we are reviewing those very closely. We think that would certainly shake things up a little bit, particularly for the harsh environment rigs in the region. But there are opportunities to take 2 rigs out possibly in '16. And so we're looking at that very hard. However, the customer base that we have, Judd, is pretty strong. We've been with Total for a long time and had a long-term relationship with Apache. And so we feel optimistic about those rigs remaining in the region with them. But as we move forward, depending on what oil prices do, I think that, that market, like several of the other markets that we've been talking about this morning, are going to be somewhat challenged over the next certainly 12 to 18 months.

It depends on what type of rig is required, what the term of the contract is. I could see the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as you've seen day rates where commodity rigs can do a majority of the work, you're going to approach cash cost a lot quicker. When you're in a market where you need high-spec, harsh environment rigs, the market is going to resist going down to that level because there's not that many of those rigs. If you're working in an area like the Middle East with Aramco that has very stringent requirements, tender requirements, you're obviously going to receive higher day rates, particularly if you're drilling gas wells. Same thing in West Africa with some of the high grading that's taking place there. They're requiring a different type of rig. So that's going to take you to a different market. And that will yield a different -- certainly a lot higher margin in those regions. But Southeast Asia, as I mentioned earlier to J.B.'s question, one of the reasons that we're looking at taking the EXLs out of Southeast Asia is because that market is rapidly becoming a more commodity market. Petronas is allowing new entrants to bid that aren't necessarily established companies. So that changes that landscape rapidly and could drive a market more closely to cash cost. So that's the way I would answer that."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan.Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen",583,"Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan.
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.
We had a terrific third quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings normalized for certain items, which Stephen will address shortly, were $0.89 per share, up from $0.70 per share in the second quarter on a normalized basis. We achieved this strong performance mainly due to all 4 of our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the full quarter and great progress in our onshore and offshore cost-control initiatives.
The third quarter also benefited from continued low out-of-service time of approximately 3%, an outstanding uptime performance for both our jack-ups, with operational downtime of 1%; and our drillships, with operational downtime of 4%. Our strong contract backlog, which currently exceeds $4 billion, provides us with earnings and free cash flow stability for the next few years. We are actively marketing our high-spec jack-ups and are in discussions with customers to extend certain of our deepwater contracts in a mutually beneficial manner. We are hopeful that we will be able to find common ground.
Though we continue to face headwinds in the jack-up market, we added 9 rig years of backlog in the Middle East and a new 10-month contract for the Rowan Gorilla IV in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We currently have 4 warm already stacked high-specification jack-ups around the world. While we continue to market these rigs in their current regions, over the coming quarters, we may choose to relocate one or more of them for contracting opportunities in other markets. Mark will be giving you details of such a move.
Given the excess capacity in the industry and our desire to reduce costs, we cold stacked the Cecil Provine and the Gorilla II during the quarter. Our cost-control initiatives continue to be effective and as a result, we are further reducing our full year 2015 operating expense guidance, which Stephen will detail later in the call. He will also lay out our initial operating expense guidance for 2016.
To reiterate what I said last quarter, we believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing costs where possible, while maintaining our focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
In summary, I'm pleased with our operational performance and cost management thus far, and we will continue to focus on solid execution and margins over the coming quarters.
Mark will walk you through the market details of our operating regions, but we can see that 2016 will be challenging as our customers continue to delay programs and cut their drilling costs.
We will continue to review our capital allocation choices, including potentially buying distressed assets, retiring debt and/or repurchasing equity when market conditions warrant. However, we believe that the current low visibility on recovery in the offshore drilling market demands caution. In the challenging market we anticipate in 2016, we will focus on improving our already solid balance sheet.
Earlier this month, we were pleased to see Moody's confirm our investment-grade credit rating, although with a negative outlook.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for an update on the markets. Thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Mark?"

My comments will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the volatility of the current market. I will mention our ultra-deepwater position and then discuss the jack-up market in more detail, given that our near-term marketing efforts are strongly focused on the rollover of our high-spec assets.
2016 is forecast to be another challenging year, and we are pleased that our 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are fully booked into 2017 or beyond.
The timing and execution of our newbuild program, combined with strong contracts and valued customers, have positioned us well to ride out the trough of this cycle.
As Tom mentioned, we have approached the subject of blend and extend with all of our ultra-deepwater customers about opportunities to help them live within their current budgetary restraints and encourage future exploration drilling in exchange for additional term to the original contract. Discussions are ongoing, and we are optimistic that we can reach mutually acceptable terms with some of our customers.
Moving on to the jack-up market. Worldwide jack-up market utilization has seen additional pressure since our last call and has decreased 5%. There are approximately 100 marketed units not currently contracted and many rigs in the active fleet that will be seeking renewals in the coming year.
Our global marketing team is creatively approaching each and every opportunity available, leveraging Rowan's long-standing reputation as a leading jack-up operator. Our efforts are centered on our high-spec units, which we believe will provide the most earnings potential in the future.
We have made some difficult but educated decisions to cold stack some of our older rigs so that utilization can be focused on our premium jack-ups. We currently have 4 high-spec -- specification units that are not contracted. And while projects in 2015 are sparse, we are hopeful for opportunities for these jack-ups in 2016.
We've recently decided to mobilize the Ralph Coffman from the Mediterranean to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which we expect to take place during the fourth quarter. We are proud of the HPHT work that the rig and crew have accomplished in the region, but given the demand decline in the area, we believe there are better opportunities for a contract in the Americas.
The J.P. Bussell was also strategically relocated since our last call from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, where it is currently available.
To reiterate Tom's remarks, we are pleased to extend 3 of our 116-C contracts with Saudi Aramco, adding significant backlog in the region.
As a reminder, the Gilbert Rowe is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco and other regional customers about future opportunities for this rig. The Middle East is one of the few regions in the world that has a projected increase in demand for 2016, and we are well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arise.
We are one of the few jack-up contractors with rigs currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We cold stacked the Cecil Provine and transferred its Fieldwood work to the EXL III, which concluded operations at the end of October.
The Gorilla III is completing the remainder of a contract with Rooster Petroleum previously drilled by the Joe Douglas. The Gorilla IV is currently working for Energy XXI, and we recently announced a contract in direct continuation with Arena Energy for an estimated duration of 10 months. Demand in the region is currently 8 units and is expected to stay flat throughout 2016.
The Joe Douglas relocated to Trinidad and commenced operations for BHP since our last call, and we are glad to add another unit to that market. We view Trinidad as a bright spot for jack-ups with high-spec capability and a robust leg and jacking structure.
There is no question that 2015 has been a difficult year and that 2016 looks to further test the fortitude of our industry. However, I believe this cycle will clearly differentiate those companies such as Rowan that have made prudent business decisions through the up cycles and the troughs of the past, and they will emerge even stronger.
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call",1715,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
For the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $274 million net of tax, a $75 million income tax charge related to a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge also net of tax versus income of $85 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included a $5 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter versus $88 million or $0.70 per share in the second quarter.
The increase is primarily attributable to the incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships and our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet.
During the third quarter, we generated revenues of $534 million, excluding rebillable items, about 8% higher than second quarter 2015 levels. An additional 97 operating days and about $57 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillships, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, which both commenced operations this year.
Our jack-up fleet generated 65 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for the Ralph Coffman and Rowan Stavanger, along with the cold stacking of the Cecil Provine and Rowan Gorilla II, somewhat offset by increased operating days on the Gorilla IV and Joe Douglas.
Our average jack-up day rates declined modestly by 3% due to lower rates on new contracts and the impact of idle time for certain rigs.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance.
Our operational downtime, which is unbillable downtime -- unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total.
Operational downtime for our drillships was approximately 4%, much better than earlier startup guidance of 10% for the first year of operation.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 13% of available days from 12% in the prior quarter.
We have reduced the manning levels and operating costs of our 4 idle jack-ups. All in all, our marketed utilization rate was 80% in the third quarter, in line with 81% achieved in the second quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses were $236 million, excluding rebills, [ph] an improvement of 2% from $241 million in the second quarter, despite approximately $10 million in costs related to our incremental drillship available days for the Rowan Relentless, which was more than offset by our ongoing cost-control efforts that resulted in a $15 million reduction.
We estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $965 million to $970 million, which is $35 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to reduced personnel-related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $245 million to $250 million, up slightly from third quarter levels, primarily due to the timing of certain repair and maintenance activities.
Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our third quarter SG&A expense totaled $29 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance in the second quarter level, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to certain liability-based awards and the impact of our cost-control measures.
We estimate our full year 2015 SG&A expense to be $118 million, slightly lower than 2014 levels. We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, slightly higher than the level experienced in the third quarter.
As I mentioned in my opening, third quarter results were adversely impacted by a $330 million pretax, noncash asset impairment charge. The impairment relates to 10 jack-up rigs and primarily results from the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the third quarter and our expectations that our customers will continue to reduce capital spending in 2015, with further meaningful reductions in 2016, which we believe would be the first back-to-back decline in operator capital spending in over 20 years.
Also during the third quarter and primarily as a result of the impairment charge, a valuation allowance of $75 million has been recorded for [indiscernible] in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized.
However, the amount of the valuation allowance could be adjusted if estimates of future U.S. taxable income during the carryforward period are increased. Additionally, the valuation allowance may be adjusted once the recent cumulative losses are no longer present as additional weight may be given to other factors such as our projection for future income.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $104 million, slightly higher than our guidance and higher than second quarter levels, as a result of the Rowan Relentless being placed into service during the second quarter. We forecast our full year 2015 depreciation expense to be slightly over $390 million, including $102 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense, which was $41 million during the third quarter was in line with our previous guidance and was higher than the prior quarter as we stopped capitalizing interest during the second quarter when the Rowan Relentless commenced operation. We expect full year 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $146 million in the fourth quarter to be flat with third quarter levels.
Excluding the impact of the noncash asset impairment charge and the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, our third quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was below our previous guidance due to the impact of projected operating results, jurisdictional mix as well as certain discrete items.
We expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens, again, excluding the impact of the impairment and valuation allowance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $53 million in the third quarter, with approximately $11 million relating to our fourth newbuild drillship, and the remainder primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. We estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $740 million to $745 million, with approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter, primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and fleet spares.
Excluding newbuild spend, 2015 capital expenditures are estimated at $175 million. And I think it's notable that all of our newbuild CapEx is now behind us and that's somewhat unique within our sector.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, with cash increasing by approximately $90 million despite our repayment of $50 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
At quarter end, we had nearly $300 million in cash and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn, providing comfortable levels of liquidity in an uncertain but potentially target-rich environment.
All in all, our 2015 results are benefiting from strong execution by our projects and deepwater teams, with early deliveries on our last 2 ships and with excellent uptime during initial deepwater operations. Our results have also been bolstered by our swift cost-reduction measures.
Since our initial 2015 guidance provided in November of last year, we've reduced 2015 operating expense guidance by $175 million or 16%. Our SG&A guidance has declined by $17 million or 12%. And finally, our maintenance CapEx guidance has been reduced by $70 million or 25%.
Although we've not completed our 2016 annual budget process, we are providing preliminary guidance, which we will update in our next quarterly call.
As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we have all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 11 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
This $4.1 billion in backlog provides Rowan with excellent visibility. However, we certainly have our work cut out for us on the remaining 14 marketed jack-ups, which have availability in 2016.
We will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry works through its excess capacity and demand begins to recover.
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $930 million to $950 million, which is a 2% to 4% decline from the estimated 2015 level, despite having a full year of expenses from 2 drillships which commenced operations during 2015. We estimate the full year impact of our last 2 drillships will increase expenses by approximately $30 million. Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline approximately $60 million to $65 million or 6% year-over-year as a result of reduced costs associated with idle jack-ups, a full year impact of cost-control measures instituted during 2015 on working rigs and in our shore bases and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by 3% to 11% and range from $105 million to $115 million.
Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $405 million to $415 million as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge.
Our 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $160 million to $165 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level as we do not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016.
We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $175 million to $200 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arise due to our securing additional work, none of which is currently planned.
We will refine this 2016 guidance in our next earnings call after we've completed our annual budgeting process.
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

Either way, we have to do it anyway, right, to be competitive, right? So we had to do it. But on the other hand, we're not seeing -- we aren't seeing rates drop that low. And I'd also say, which a number of investors have pointed out is that although these cost reductions are very tough and very difficult, when the rebound comes and we do believe it will, then we will see obviously massive margin expansion because the costs won't go up as fast as the day rates go up.

So the real point is, I guess, when we stack rigs, obviously, what -- the big question is, is how quickly do we change the crewing levels on those rigs. And that really obviously depends a lot about which region that rig is in, because sometimes we use contract labor, particularly in Southeast Asia and a couple of other places. But when we stack a rig, how quickly do we change, particularly the junior crews, how quickly do we cut costs? And obviously, when we've been -- we've spent years building experience to have a world-class drilling company and that experience is our senior leaders on the rig. To lay them off, it's a very difficult decision. So we do a lot of bump back strategies, where we basically push people down. And we also do -- spend a lot of time looking through our workforce and looking who are nonperformers, all of which, it's easy to say -- it's easy if you say it really fast, but it's actually very difficult to do. And so we've been doing a lot of that. The onshore costs are a bit harder to change because they -- at least they're not as clearly variable as the offshore costs. And so the onshore costs you have to kind of stand back and look at making structural changes over time. And so I'd say the onshore cost is pretty sticky, but everything is variable in the long term, right? So we're sort of looking at our onshore costs and looking at how we can centralize back-office functions and try to improve or reduce the support cost without reducing the effectiveness of the onshore cost -- of the onshore support capability. So it's difficult, but we've done it for some time now. We know what are a lot of the other moves we can make are and we just have to do them slowly and carefully."

We actually did send a construction manager earlier on this year to go and look at the quality of the construction in multiple yards to sort of try and assess them. We get a lot of intelligence, which is obviously the same as all of our competitors get, about who's doing what. And I probably get 2 or 3 emails every week telling me the status of every rig that's being built in China, probably you do as well. But I would say that -- of that number, there's some that's going to go into the domestic market, right? And when you high grade the asset, the rig that's being built by someone that's never owned a rig, by a project team which is very small, in a shipyard that has never built a rig, is definitely going to be -- the chances of it being super successful or the first couple of them out of the gate are going to be lower. So some of those would probably go to domestic market, to the domestic Chinese market. Of the remainder -- and I've seen different numbers of what, how many they are. Maybe it's 80, right? Maybe it's 90. I think most of them get built if they're fairly far along, but I would say that I just don't see them coming out of the shipyard anytime soon. One of our competitor CEOs, Carl Trowell, made a comment, which I thought was very funny. He said, ""Amateur hour is over, right?"" And so if you're turning up -- if you're Rowan turning up with some jack-ups, Chinese or built in Singapore or anywhere else, that's one thing to a major IOC or NOC. But if you're a drilling company that no one has heard of, it's probably a lot harder to sell, particularly if you're doing the type of work that we're really focused on, the high temperature, high pressure work. And if you're doing post holes, then maybe they've got more chance. So I do think that those rigs will eventually come in the market, but I don't see them coming in any time -- there's not like a bunch of them kind of wanting to swamp the market. And our Investor Relations Manager, Chris Pitre, put up an interesting slide on our investor deck, which basically shows when they said they were going to be delivered and when they are going to being delivered or what they now say they're going to be delivered. And so I see it as a bit of a bow wave, right? They're going to come -- they'll get pushed to the right. And as they're needed, they'll enter the market, but not before. That's kind of a long answer, Angie, sorry, but that's how we think about it."

It depends on what type of rig is required, what the term of the contract is. I could see the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as you've seen day rates where commodity rigs can do a majority of the work, you're going to approach cash cost a lot quicker. When you're in a market where you need high-spec, harsh environment rigs, the market is going to resist going down to that level because there's not that many of those rigs. If you're working in an area like the Middle East with Aramco that has very stringent requirements, tender requirements, you're obviously going to receive higher day rates, particularly if you're drilling gas wells. Same thing in West Africa with some of the high grading that's taking place there. They're requiring a different type of rig. So that's going to take you to a different market. And that will yield a different -- certainly a lot higher margin in those regions. But Southeast Asia, as I mentioned earlier to J.B.'s question, one of the reasons that we're looking at taking the EXLs out of Southeast Asia is because that market is rapidly becoming a more commodity market. Petronas is allowing new entrants to bid that aren't necessarily established companies. So that changes that landscape rapidly and could drive a market more closely to cash cost.

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest in Rowan.
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.
We had a terrific third quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings normalized for certain items, which Stephen will address shortly, were $0.89 per share, up from $0.70 per share in the second quarter on a normalized basis. We achieved this strong performance mainly due to all 4 of our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the full quarter and great progress in our onshore and offshore cost-control initiatives.
The third quarter also benefited from continued low out-of-service time of approximately 3%, an outstanding uptime performance for both our jack-ups, with operational downtime of 1%; and our drillships, with operational downtime of 4%. Our strong contract backlog, which currently exceeds $4 billion, provides us with earnings and free cash flow stability for the next few years. We are actively marketing our high-spec jack-ups and are in discussions with customers to extend certain of our deepwater contracts in a mutually beneficial manner. We are hopeful that we will be able to find common ground.
Though we continue to face headwinds in the jack-up market, we added 9 rig years of backlog in the Middle East and a new 10-month contract for the Rowan Gorilla IV in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We currently have 4 warm already stacked high-specification jack-ups around the world. While we continue to market these rigs in their current regions, over the coming quarters, we may choose to relocate one or more of them for contracting opportunities in other markets. Mark will be giving you details of such a move.
Given the excess capacity in the industry and our desire to reduce costs, we cold stacked the Cecil Provine and the Gorilla II during the quarter. Our cost-control initiatives continue to be effective and as a result, we are further reducing our full year 2015 operating expense guidance, which Stephen will detail later in the call. He will also lay out our initial operating expense guidance for 2016.
To reiterate what I said last quarter, we believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing costs where possible, while maintaining our focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
In summary, I'm pleased with our operational performance and cost management thus far, and we will continue to focus on solid execution and margins over the coming quarters.
Mark will walk you through the market details of our operating regions, but we can see that 2016 will be challenging as our customers continue to delay programs and cut their drilling costs.
We will continue to review our capital allocation choices, including potentially buying distressed assets, retiring debt and/or repurchasing equity when market conditions warrant. However, we believe that the current low visibility on recovery in the offshore drilling market demands caution. In the challenging market we anticipate in 2016, we will focus on improving our already solid balance sheet.
Earlier this month, we were pleased to see Moody's confirm our investment-grade credit rating, although with a negative outlook.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for an update on the markets. Thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Mark?"

My comments will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the volatility of the current market.

My comments will be brief today given the sensitivity of ongoing contract discussions and the volatility of the current market. I will mention our ultra-deepwater position and then discuss the jack-up market in more detail, given that our near-term marketing efforts are strongly focused on the rollover of our high-spec assets.
2016 is forecast to be another challenging year, and we are pleased that our 4 ultra-deepwater drillships are fully booked into 2017 or beyond.
The timing and execution of our newbuild program, combined with strong contracts and valued customers, have positioned us well to ride out the trough of this cycle.
As Tom mentioned, we have approached the subject of blend and extend with all of our ultra-deepwater customers about opportunities to help them live within their current budgetary restraints and encourage future exploration drilling in exchange for additional term to the original contract. Discussions are ongoing, and we are optimistic that we can reach mutually acceptable terms with some of our customers.
Moving on to the jack-up market. Worldwide jack-up market utilization has seen additional pressure since our last call and has decreased 5%. There are approximately 100 marketed units not currently contracted and many rigs in the active fleet that will be seeking renewals in the coming year.
Our global marketing team is creatively approaching each and every opportunity available, leveraging Rowan's long-standing reputation as a leading jack-up operator. Our efforts are centered on our high-spec units, which we believe will provide the most earnings potential in the future.
We have made some difficult but educated decisions to cold stack some of our older rigs so that utilization can be focused on our premium jack-ups. We currently have 4 high-spec -- specification units that are not contracted. And while projects in 2015 are sparse, we are hopeful for opportunities for these jack-ups in 2016.
We've recently decided to mobilize the Ralph Coffman from the Mediterranean to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which we expect to take place during the fourth quarter. We are proud of the HPHT work that the rig and crew have accomplished in the region, but given the demand decline in the area, we believe there are better opportunities for a contract in the Americas.
The J.P. Bussell was also strategically relocated since our last call from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, where it is currently available.
To reiterate Tom's remarks, we are pleased to extend 3 of our 116-C contracts with Saudi Aramco, adding significant backlog in the region.
As a reminder, the Gilbert Rowe is on contract until mid-December 2015. We remain in discussions with Saudi Aramco and other regional customers about future opportunities for this rig. The Middle East is one of the few regions in the world that has a projected increase in demand for 2016, and we are well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arise.
We are one of the few jack-up contractors with rigs currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We cold stacked the Cecil Provine and transferred its Fieldwood work to the EXL III, which concluded operations at the end of October.
The Gorilla III is completing the remainder of a contract with Rooster Petroleum previously drilled by the Joe Douglas. The Gorilla IV is currently working for Energy XXI, and we recently announced a contract in direct continuation with Arena Energy for an estimated duration of 10 months. Demand in the region is currently 8 units and is expected to stay flat throughout 2016.
The Joe Douglas relocated to Trinidad and commenced operations for BHP since our last call, and we are glad to add another unit to that market. We view Trinidad as a bright spot for jack-ups with high-spec capability and a robust leg and jacking structure.
There is no question that 2015 has been a difficult year and that 2016 looks to further test the fortitude of our industry. However, I believe this cycle will clearly differentiate those companies such as Rowan that have made prudent business decisions through the up cycles and the troughs of the past, and they will emerge even stronger.
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,289877699,891331,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call",1715,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our third quarter 2015 operating results compared to second quarter 2015 results and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
For the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share, including a noncash impairment charge of $274 million net of tax, a $75 million income tax charge related to a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge also net of tax versus income of $85 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included a $5 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter versus $88 million or $0.70 per share in the second quarter.
The increase is primarily attributable to the incremental activity from our ultra-deepwater drillships and our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet.
During the third quarter, we generated revenues of $534 million, excluding rebillable items, about 8% higher than second quarter 2015 levels. An additional 97 operating days and about $57 million were contributed by our third and fourth drillships, the Rowan Reliance and Rowan Relentless, which both commenced operations this year.
Our jack-up fleet generated 65 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time for the Ralph Coffman and Rowan Stavanger, along with the cold stacking of the Cecil Provine and Rowan Gorilla II, somewhat offset by increased operating days on the Gorilla IV and Joe Douglas.
Our average jack-up day rates declined modestly by 3% due to lower rates on new contracts and the impact of idle time for certain rigs.
Our out-of-service time was approximately 3% of our available rig days during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance.
Our operational downtime, which is unbillable downtime -- unbillable time when a rig is operating, was approximately 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total.
Operational downtime for our drillships was approximately 4%, much better than earlier startup guidance of 10% for the first year of operation.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased to 13% of available days from 12% in the prior quarter.
We have reduced the manning levels and operating costs of our 4 idle jack-ups. All in all, our marketed utilization rate was 80% in the third quarter, in line with 81% achieved in the second quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses were $236 million, excluding rebills, [ph] an improvement of 2% from $241 million in the second quarter, despite approximately $10 million in costs related to our incremental drillship available days for the Rowan Relentless, which was more than offset by our ongoing cost-control efforts that resulted in a $15 million reduction.
We estimate our full year 2015 operating expenses will range from $965 million to $970 million, which is $35 million to $40 million lower than our previous guidance. This decrease is due largely to reduced personnel-related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses are expected to range from $245 million to $250 million, up slightly from third quarter levels, primarily due to the timing of certain repair and maintenance activities.
Again, all of this guidance excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our third quarter SG&A expense totaled $29 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance in the second quarter level, primarily due to the lower value of equity compensation expense related to certain liability-based awards and the impact of our cost-control measures.
We estimate our full year 2015 SG&A expense to be $118 million, slightly lower than 2014 levels. We expect to incur SG&A expense of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, slightly higher than the level experienced in the third quarter.
As I mentioned in my opening, third quarter results were adversely impacted by a $330 million pretax, noncash asset impairment charge. The impairment relates to 10 jack-up rigs and primarily results from the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the third quarter and our expectations that our customers will continue to reduce capital spending in 2015, with further meaningful reductions in 2016, which we believe would be the first back-to-back decline in operator capital spending in over 20 years.
Also during the third quarter and primarily as a result of the impairment charge, a valuation allowance of $75 million has been recorded for [indiscernible] in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized.
However, the amount of the valuation allowance could be adjusted if estimates of future U.S. taxable income during the carryforward period are increased. Additionally, the valuation allowance may be adjusted once the recent cumulative losses are no longer present as additional weight may be given to other factors such as our projection for future income.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $104 million, slightly higher than our guidance and higher than second quarter levels, as a result of the Rowan Relentless being placed into service during the second quarter. We forecast our full year 2015 depreciation expense to be slightly over $390 million, including $102 million in the fourth quarter.
Interest expense, which was $41 million during the third quarter was in line with our previous guidance and was higher than the prior quarter as we stopped capitalizing interest during the second quarter when the Rowan Relentless commenced operation. We expect full year 2015 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, will approximate $146 million in the fourth quarter to be flat with third quarter levels.
Excluding the impact of the noncash asset impairment charge and the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, our third quarter effective tax rate was approximately 8%, which was below our previous guidance due to the impact of projected operating results, jurisdictional mix as well as certain discrete items.
We expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens, again, excluding the impact of the impairment and valuation allowance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $53 million in the third quarter, with approximately $11 million relating to our fourth newbuild drillship, and the remainder primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. We estimate our full year 2015 capital expenditures will range from $740 million to $745 million, with approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter, primarily for maintenance CapEx, upgrades and fleet spares.
Excluding newbuild spend, 2015 capital expenditures are estimated at $175 million. And I think it's notable that all of our newbuild CapEx is now behind us and that's somewhat unique within our sector.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, with cash increasing by approximately $90 million despite our repayment of $50 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
At quarter end, we had nearly $300 million in cash and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn, providing comfortable levels of liquidity in an uncertain but potentially target-rich environment.
All in all, our 2015 results are benefiting from strong execution by our projects and deepwater teams, with early deliveries on our last 2 ships and with excellent uptime during initial deepwater operations. Our results have also been bolstered by our swift cost-reduction measures.
Since our initial 2015 guidance provided in November of last year, we've reduced 2015 operating expense guidance by $175 million or 16%. Our SG&A guidance has declined by $17 million or 12%. And finally, our maintenance CapEx guidance has been reduced by $70 million or 25%.
Although we've not completed our 2016 annual budget process, we are providing preliminary guidance, which we will update in our next quarterly call.
As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we have all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 11 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
This $4.1 billion in backlog provides Rowan with excellent visibility. However, we certainly have our work cut out for us on the remaining 14 marketed jack-ups, which have availability in 2016.
We will likely continue to experience elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry works through its excess capacity and demand begins to recover.
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $930 million to $950 million, which is a 2% to 4% decline from the estimated 2015 level, despite having a full year of expenses from 2 drillships which commenced operations during 2015. We estimate the full year impact of our last 2 drillships will increase expenses by approximately $30 million. Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline approximately $60 million to $65 million or 6% year-over-year as a result of reduced costs associated with idle jack-ups, a full year impact of cost-control measures instituted during 2015 on working rigs and in our shore bases and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by 3% to 11% and range from $105 million to $115 million.
Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $405 million to $415 million as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge.
Our 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $160 million to $165 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level as we do not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016.
We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $175 million to $200 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arise due to our securing additional work, none of which is currently planned.
We will refine this 2016 guidance in our next earnings call after we've completed our annual budgeting process.

Either way, we have to do it anyway, right, to be competitive, right? So we had to do it. But on the other hand, we're not seeing -- we aren't seeing rates drop that low. And I'd also say, which a number of investors have pointed out is that although these cost reductions are very tough and very difficult, when the rebound comes and we do believe it will, then we will see obviously massive margin expansion because the costs won't go up as fast as the day rates go up.

And we're -- one of the things on cost cutting is you have to do it very carefully because you have to make sure that you don't damage the -- as I made in my comment, the operational integrity of what you're trying to achieve. And so I do feel that at Rowan, just because we were going into Norway and we were going into deepwater, we've had a lot of changes in the company and so we started our cost-cutting effort really at the beginning of '14. And so we sort of laid out a plan and we know the levers that we can pull. And we haven't pulled them all for sure and some of them are very painful to pull. So I think we've got a plan, but it's definitely is -- it's definitely tough to cut costs like we are and to continue to do it, but if it's what's necessary, I mean, we'll do it."

So the real point is, I guess, when we stack rigs, obviously, what -- the big question is, is how quickly do we change the crewing levels on those rigs. And that really obviously depends a lot about which region that rig is in, because sometimes we use contract labor, particularly in Southeast Asia and a couple of other places. But when we stack a rig, how quickly do we change, particularly the junior crews, how quickly do we cut costs? And obviously, when we've been -- we've spent years building experience to have a world-class drilling company and that experience is our senior leaders on the rig. To lay them off, it's a very difficult decision. So we do a lot of bump back strategies, where we basically push people down. And we also do -- spend a lot of time looking through our workforce and looking who are nonperformers, all of which, it's easy to say -- it's easy if you say it really fast, but it's actually very difficult to do. And so we've been doing a lot of that. The onshore costs are a bit harder to change because they -- at least they're not as clearly variable as the offshore costs. And so the onshore costs you have to kind of stand back and look at making structural changes over time. And so I'd say the onshore cost is pretty sticky, but everything is variable in the long term, right? So we're sort of looking at our onshore costs and looking at how we can centralize back-office functions and try to improve or reduce the support cost without reducing the effectiveness of the onshore cost -- of the onshore support capability. So it's difficult, but we've done it for some time now. We know what are a lot of the other moves we can make are and we just have to do them slowly and carefully."

On the other hand, an opportunity because we obviously clearly like the jack-up market. We like the floating market, but we like the jack-up market. And so we look at those both as, could they compete with us? And ultimately, could they be part of our fleet? So we do see them as an opportunity. We also think of them as a threat. We actually did send a construction manager earlier on this year to go and look at the quality of the construction in multiple yards to sort of try and assess them. We get a lot of intelligence, which is obviously the same as all of our competitors get, about who's doing what. And I probably get 2 or 3 emails every week telling me the status of every rig that's being built in China, probably you do as well. But I would say that -- of that number, there's some that's going to go into the domestic market, right? And when you high grade the asset, the rig that's being built by someone that's never owned a rig, by a project team which is very small, in a shipyard that has never built a rig, is definitely going to be -- the chances of it being super successful or the first couple of them out of the gate are going to be lower. So some of those would probably go to domestic market, to the domestic Chinese market. Of the remainder -- and I've seen different numbers of what, how many they are. Maybe it's 80, right? Maybe it's 90. I think most of them get built if they're fairly far along, but I would say that I just don't see them coming out of the shipyard anytime soon. One of our competitor CEOs, Carl Trowell, made a comment, which I thought was very funny. He said, ""Amateur hour is over, right?"" And so if you're turning up -- if you're Rowan turning up with some jack-ups, Chinese or built in Singapore or anywhere else, that's one thing to a major IOC or NOC. But if you're a drilling company that no one has heard of, it's probably a lot harder to sell, particularly if you're doing the type of work that we're really focused on, the high temperature, high pressure work. And if you're doing post holes, then maybe they've got more chance. So I do think that those rigs will eventually come in the market, but I don't see them coming in any time -- there's not like a bunch of them kind of wanting to swamp the market. And our Investor Relations Manager, Chris Pitre, put up an interesting slide on our investor deck, which basically shows when they said they were going to be delivered and when they are going to being delivered or what they now say they're going to be delivered. And so I see it as a bit of a bow wave, right? They're going to come -- they'll get pushed to the right. And as they're needed, they'll enter the market, but not before. That's kind of a long answer, Angie, sorry, but that's how we think about it."

You guys were talking about for the high-spec jack-up market, how day rates are still well above cash costs. That you're looking at a number of multiyear contracts out there, but we all know that there's a huge surplus of rigs searching for work. Help me understand how and why we're not seeing day rates in these cases really approach cash costs."

We actually publish a lot of our OpEx on the -- in our investor deck, right? So you can see where they are and they're not down there yet. I do think there's a market where we do see customers bidding, contracts going out, with costs -- double cash costs or -- now there is a lot of -- there are a lot of rigs out there, but it costs a lot of money to move them between regions and do their special surveys. So Mark, maybe you'll have better ideas?"

It depends on what type of rig is required, what the term of the contract is. I could see the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as you've seen day rates where commodity rigs can do a majority of the work, you're going to approach cash cost a lot quicker. When you're in a market where you need high-spec, harsh environment rigs, the market is going to resist going down to that level because there's not that many of those rigs. If you're working in an area like the Middle East with Aramco that has very stringent requirements, tender requirements, you're obviously going to receive higher day rates, particularly if you're drilling gas wells. Same thing in West Africa with some of the high grading that's taking place there. They're requiring a different type of rig. So that's going to take you to a different market. And that will yield a different -- certainly a lot higher margin in those regions. But Southeast Asia, as I mentioned earlier to J.B.'s question, one of the reasons that we're looking at taking the EXLs out of Southeast Asia is because that market is rapidly becoming a more commodity market. Petronas is allowing new entrants to bid that aren't necessarily established companies. So that changes that landscape rapidly and could drive a market more closely to cash cost. So that's the way I would answer that."
